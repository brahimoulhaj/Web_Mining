Rabat – Some of the most recurrently asked questions regarding the direction that post-Bouteflika Algeria would take have had to do with diplomatic relations with Morocco, with some observers asking whether the country’s next president would be willing to put behind decades of mistrust and hostility and usher a new age in the icy diplomatic relations with Rabat. The query was made particularly pertinent when, on December 13, Abdelmadjid Tebboune emerged victorious from the recently held Algerian presidential elections. It was tempting, given the man’s documented animus towards Morocco, to know whether, as Algeria’s president-elect, he would accept the “good neighbors” and “brotherhood” hand Morocco’s King has repeatedly extended in the past months. Just hours after the results, Tebounne gave some insights as to what his attitude might be towards Morocco. “I am extremely sensitive when it comes to national sovereignty. I forgive no one for interfering with or harming our sovereignty,” said Tebboune. Sensing this was a bit vague, he went on to point to Morocco by name. But he added a note of reserve, playing down his earlier bellicose tone and vaguely suggesting that Rabat may not be the existential enemy he was referring to. “I know Moroccans very well. I know that people there love Algeria and Algerians. They are nice people.” But what about the central, though unarticulated, question about the fate of the Algeria-Morocco borders? Here, Tebboune was more recognizable. He provided an answer that, although slightly dovish compared to the hostility some other presidential candidates showed towards Morocco in the buildup to the December 12 elections, echoed what he had said weeks earlier during his presidential campaign. On the campaign trail, Tebboune requested a formal apology from Morocco for being the first to close the borders in retaliation to the 1994 terrorist attack in Marrakech. As president-elect, however, Tebboune was now more circonspect, subtle. “There have been events that have caused the borders to close. In my opinion, the main cause of the conflict must be removed and everything else will follow.” The message was the same, but the tone here was more accommodating. The main message—was one intended?—was therefore confusing here. Tebboune had gone from shrugging off the hostility to declaring Moroccans “nice” and Algeria-loving, to finally accusing Rabat—though diplomatically—of causing the diplomatic tension in the first place. At the very least, the sheer confusion of clues—the impossibility of taking one core message from Tebboune’s December 13 speech—had an element of hope to it. The doubt and ambiguity Tebboune evinced on December 13 was the exact antithesis of his earlier rigid ferocity when it came to anything Morocco-related. As Prime Minister under Bouteflika, Tebboune symbolized the typical Morocco-bashing senior Algerian official, wholeheartedly considering Rabat as an existential threat to Algeria’s stability and regional aspirations. And then there was that meandering and ambiguity as president-elect, inviting the suggestion that Algeria-Morocco ties may experience a relative degree of warmth under Tebboune. But those who were mildly encouraged by Tebboune’s ambiguous December 13 speech were also mildly disappointed by his apparently unblinking assuredness days later when speaking about Morocco as an existential threat to Algeria. Even more dismaying, as far as Rabat is concerned, was Tebboune’s insistence that “the question of Western Sahara is a matter of decolonization.” What changed? Or rather, what could have caused such noticeable change in Tebboune’s rhetoric in two speeches given within a week of each other? There can be two answers. The first one would contend that, on December 13, Tebboune, still in a celebratory mood just hours after his resounding victory in the first round, made remarks that did not exactly reflect his take on the complicated question of Algeria-Morocco relations. His joy had gotten the better of him, making him slightly oblivious to how the Algerian establishment views Morocco. The second explanation, more pertinent, is that, in subsequent meetings, the Algerian deep state, the true brokers of power pulling the strings from behind the scenes, might have reminded Tebboune of the boundaries and red lines when it comes to issues as crucial as Morocco-Algeria ties. This was the impregnable “psychological barrier” of which Samir Bennis rightly spoke in the wake of the short-lived euphoria that followed the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The argument, that Bouteflika’s fall was but “a symbolic victory,” posits that there will be no historical overtures in the Morocco-Algeria chapter so long as Algerian presidents remain figureheads whose central mission consists in securing the relevance and longevity of a deep state that continues to look at Morocco from viscerally hostile lenses. Bouteflika’s development from a moderate Foreign Affairs  Minister initially receptive of Rabat’s Western Sahara position to a Morocco-bashing president gives considerable credence to the argument that longevity in the highest echelons of power in Algeria requires catering to the mood and demands of the military establishment. Tebboune’s December 19 speech is to a large degree reminiscent of Bouteflika’s first presidential speech in 1999. As a way of reassuring the military establishment, Bouteflika had fumed at Morocco for the “hogra,” or humiliation, it inflicted on a newly independent Algeria in the 1963 Sand War. He promised revenge. Over the months since Bouteflika resigned, one frequently deployed argument against those with high expectations about post-Bouteflika Algeria has been the charge that, as it has done in the six decades since independence, the army would pick another pliable, figurehead president to salvage whatever is salvageable from the political-military establishment. Key to the longevity of the Algerian establishment, Dalia Ghanem-Yazbeck wrote in a 2018 paper,  has been the cunning strategy of “limiting change through change.” She argued: “Major decision makers in Algeria have crafted, renewed, and refined strategies to sustain the system and their roles in it. The country’s next presidential election, scheduled for 2019, is not likely to constitute a turning point. Whoever is elected—whether Bouteflika secures a fifth term or someone else takes office—will be chosen by the military political elite and will be purely a product of this system.” Despite the pertinence of arguments that present the Algerian political establishment as wedded to fixed dogmas, the socio-political context that led to the unsuspected end of Bouteflika’s two-decade presidency offers some ground for a more nuanced analysis of the Algerian ancient regime’s resilience. In recent months, the Algerian political and military establishment, seemingly inoculated against progress, groomed to resist change, has tried–and considerably succeeded– to stifle the people’s demand for radical change. In the meantime, President Tebboune, trying to style himself as not exactly the figurehead many expect him to be, has spoken of his vision of “a new Algeria.” Even if Tebboune’s “new Algeria” is not exactly the new Algeria that many Algerians have asked for, there is perceptible apprehension in the corridors of power in Algiers. With the forced departure of Bouteflika came the suggestion that the country may be marching towards a point where, ultimately, the establishment’s traditional politics and diplomacy of exhaustion will not be as effective as it used to be. “But while the regime has shown considerable resilience and adaptability, the system it has created is not invulnerable and will continuously be tested by social change in Algeria,” Ghanem-Yazbeck concluded in her exploration of the Algerian establishment’s longevity. Over the years, most Algerians have called for the opening of borders with Morocco. Most recently, there has been an avalanche of “let’s open our borders” and “we are brothers” calls in both countries. Activists and iconic cultural personalities on both sides have portrayed the continuing hostility between the two countries as anachronistic and not reflective of the “shared aspirations” and cultural similarities binding both people. Morocco has wholeheartedly embraced this message of change, with King Mohammed VI repeatedly calling for “a frank dialogue” to solve the issues between the two countries. In his congratulatory message to Tebboune, the Moroccan King reiterated his call, urging the new Algerian president to “open a new chapter in our two countries’ relations.” But President Tebboune’s moment of nationalist convulsion on December 19 has already convinced a number of Moroccan observers that Tebboune’s Algeria will be a continuation of Bouteflika’s. That, fundamentally, nothing new–or encouraging–should be expected from Algiers regarding its icy relations with Rabat. This argument, already sound and pertinent in its own right, was rendered even more cogent as Said Chengriha, who has a history of Morocco-bashing statements, recently replaced the late General Gaid Salah as chief-of-staff of the Algerian army. Bouteflika and General Salah may have gone, but the people who have filled their seats will exactly behave as they would were they still around, some commentators have said. Contributing to the cogency of this argument is the  visceral hatred lens through which Algeria’s military-industrial complex still continues to perceive Morocco, even as Rabat seeks to settle the two countries’ decades of mutual distrust. Besides their fundamental disagreements, Western Sahara being the most obvious example, there is also the fact that, some have construed, continued enmity with Morocco offers a much-needed distraction for the Algerian establishment. Having an existential threat–real or imagined–acts as an effective mechanism to rally people around “national security” or stability. It is galvanizing, morale-boosting, even–and especially– in moments of dire domestic crises.  It births and sustains a certain rancor and hard nationalism-inspired political environment that provides easy explanations for the most complex issues facing a country, or very complex explanations for the simplest political failures of the governing elite. This offers fertile ground for a kind of programmatic defense of the comfort and stability that only the establishment is supposedly able to provide or guarantee. Viewed through this lens, then, as it stands “between radical change and superficial reform,” Tebboune’s presidency is mostly expected to deliver the latter. Still, some rather marginal voices expect Tebboune to gradually make notable changes. But, the counterargument seems to rejoinder, how do you challenge  the status quo when you are its poster child? Or when, as many Algerian and foreign observers have suggested, the status quo picked you as president in the first place? How, in other words, does one upend a system on which hinges one’s very existence and survival? The questions are tough ones, and they lead to the natural conclusion that Tebboune’s presidency is an extension of Bouteflika’s. The tone and message of such a conclusion is familiar stuff in narratives around Morocco-Algeria relations. But this conclusion should be resisted for the time being. If Tebboune really means business with his “new Algeria” ambitions, his presidency can at least be a tale of constant drifting between accommodation and surrender. In the first case scenario, he would subtly act to change some old, entrenched practices without being unnecessarily defiant or rebellious with regards to the political-military establishment. In the second case, he would, like Bouteflika before him, completely surrender to the demands and mood of the deep-state, losing in the process any moderate views he may have had about the “historic” hostility with Morocco. Whether Tebboune espouses an incontrovertibly vitriolic rhetoric towards Morocco (to pander to the deep state) or embraces the working pragmatism that some things do really need to change between the two neighbors remains to be seen in his first two years as president. After all, the encroachment of a history of overt hostility and diplomatic tensions is not all there is to Morocco-Algeria relations. Even when tensions rose recently around the Western Sahara question, there were encouraging instances of a possible rapprochement. Algeria supported Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup, arguing it was supporting the dream of a “brother” country to host Africa’s second World Cup. In the ensuing months, activists and politicians in both countries began speaking of an eventual joint Maghrebi bid. “After losing the 2026 FIFA World Cup battle, Morocco should now know that our true friends and allies are first and foremost our neighbors,” a Moroccan columnist wrote in the aftermath of the Morocco 2026 fever. “We share a history, a culture, and so many other beautiful things. Maghreb United? Yes, definitely, for sports and brotherhood can mend what politics have for so long broken.” During the 2014 World Cup, where Algeria impressed and was only marginally defeated by Germany, who went on to lift the trophy, Moroccans rooted for the Algerian national team, singing, in the process, songs of brotherhood and hymns of “ Maghrebi unity” and “let’s open our borders.” Algerians returned the favor at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. With Algeria out of contention, Algerian fans sang and rooted for Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Most recently, after Morocco underperformed at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, Moroccans turned to the Algerian national team. “1, 2, 3 Viva Algerie” became commonplace in Moroccan cafes, with Atlas Lions fans saying that an Algerian victory would be Morocco’s–symplocally at least. Such displays of solidarity are not nothing for the de-intoxication of the political (or diplomatic) climate between the two countries. Of course, the point is not that all these publicly expressed sentiments of “sister nations” and sports-facilitated fraternal bonding will miraculously help mend decades of enmity. The point is that these do help in the long process of change in rhetoric and attitude that a “historic” rapprochement would entail. “This will not happen overnight,” a Moroccan professor of international relations recently told me on condition of anonymity. He added, however, “Sports can be a very good starting point, as a shared organization of the World Cup would necessitate open borders.” More broadly, meanwhile, even among those who expect the Algerian deep state to have Beddoune committed to the country’s traditional boundaries in diplomacy and domestic policies, there is an unarticulated agreement with the notion that, theoretically at least, Beddoune’s Algeria is not quite Bouteflika’s. The idea is that mentalities have evolved, and the old trick of distracting and delaying social change by pointing to an existential threat from outside in order to galvanize and rally may not work on the new generation of Algerians more in tune with changes happening elsewhere and demanding that the ruling elite delivers beyond its old, and no longer sufficient, promise of national security and stability. When asked whether the death of General Gaid Salah would change anything of substance in the military’s grip on political power in Algeria, Franco-Algerian political essayist Slimane Zeghidour appeared to say, “Not quite. Not exactly.” But he hastened to add that there are winds of change beneath what appears like an intractable, impenetrable status quo. There is, he argued, a new generation of Algerian officers who see things differently both on the domestic and diplomatic fronts. Whether or not a prospective Algiers-Rabat rapprochement hinges on a generational change in Algeria, there have been encouraging headwinds in recent months. Amar Saadani, a former secretary-general of Algeria’s ruling party, recently surprised the Algerian establishment when he said that “Western Sahara is Moroccan and nothing else.” In his bombshell statement, Saadani called, among other things, for mending the ties between Algiers and Rabat. He even went as far as bravely suggesting that Algeria ends its financial and logistic support for the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria, of course, distanced itself from Saadani’s comments. But the very fact that a former FLN leader could come out with such Morocco-friendly rhetoric was enough to suggest that settling the “historical enmity” between Rabat and Algiers is not as hopeless as it would appear. Solving the hurdle at hand, one Algerian senior diplomat has been quoted as saying, requires skilled Moroccan and Algerian diplomats to gradually settle some of the unresolved business. When Algiers insists on receiving an apology from Rabat for being the first to close its borders in the aftermath of the Marrakech terrorist attack in 1994, the diplomat argued, Algerian diplomats do not exactly have in mind a literal or formal apology. Would a perception of sincere contrition in Morocco’s repeated calls for “a new chapter” suffice? Yes, the Algerian diplomat appeared to suggest. With Morocco’s new, “proactive” diplomacy’s insistent appeals to “genuine” and “constructive dialogue,” it is not that unthinkable to expect such a move from Rabat as a further guarantee of its good faith. The question, then, remains how President Tebboune would welcome such a development. In any case, such an event would test the sincerity of Tebboune’s position when he said that things would go back to normal once “the main cause of the conflict” is “removed.” Now consider the Groundhog Day analogy. At its most basic, there was a perceptible degree of historical resonance to Tebboune’s December 19 speech. Appearing both sceptical and welcoming of Morocco’s dialogue offer, Tebboune’s ambiguity offered a picture of firmness and flexibility. Confronted with the dull monotony and tired repetitiveness of human existence, Roger Ebert suggested in his celebrated review of the film Groundhog Day, “the good news is that we can learn to be better people.” Like individuals going through an existential crisis, countries–and political regimes–in a similar situation can–or have to–reassess some of their traditional positions in order to confront the promises and uncertainties of the future–and the present. Groundhog Day’s great lesson, as Ryan Gilbey put it, is that the secret to ending a repetitive cycle of sameness and predictability always lies within the self. As strange or as out of place as this suggestion may appear, the insight applies to Tebboune’s Algeria, especially as the Algerian establishment now faces its biggest legitimacy crisis. Crisis “consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born,” the Italian Antonio Gramsci notably wrote. In  the context of the legitimacy crisis the Algerian regime is facing, as well as the bumpy road ahead in its ties with Morocco, it can be said that with Tebboune’s presidency has merged a new version of the old question about Morocco-Algeria relations: Will the dying alternatives exemplified by the hawkish establishment preempt the much-needed generational change, new alternatives? Answers, at least positive or encouraging ones, are not forthcoming. But that shouldn’t mean that one should expect the worst.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) summoned journalist Omar Radi for a hearing on Thursday, December 26. The journalist was brought before the King’s prosecutor at Casablanca’s court of first instance, but the reasons behind the summons remain unknown. The journalist received an oral summons via telephone first, on Tuesday, December 24, before receiving another written letter from the BNPJ on Wednesday, December 25. This is the second time this year that BNPJ has summoned Radi to the court. The first time dates back to April 19, when authorities investigated one of his social media posts. The investigation concerned comments on the verdicts pronounced by judge Lahcen Tolfi in the Hirak Rif trial, explained Radi’s lawyer Said Benhammani to the press. On April 5, the judge sentenced 53 members of Hirak Rif to prison, with sentences of up to 20 years. Police interrogated Radi on a tweet where he criticized the judge and questioned his independence. The social media post was published on the night after the sentences were announced. Radi is a freelance journalist and a human rights activist. He is a member of the association Attac Maroc,  a human rights and social justice advocacy group.

Rabat – The US Department of State has published the transcript of a briefing session with two senior US officials following their recent visit to Morocco with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The transcript, which appears to have been published much earlier this month,  is now available on the US State Department’s website. The document, does not, however,  reveal the identity of the two officials. Pompeo arrived in Rabat on December 5. He was accompanied by several senior US officials and had several meetings with Moroccan ministers and other high-ranking officials to boost the “strategic cooperation” between Rabat and Washington. The discussions addressed several topics of shared interests, according to the two officials who seemed optimistic about the prospects of cooperation and partnership between Morocco and the US. The topics discussed included the role of Morocco in Africa and in the Arab world, the terrorist threats in the Sahel, Morocco’s position on Iran and Hezbollah, the economic influence of China, and the future of American investments in Morocco. A “shared threat perception” The two officials expressed the strength of the partnership between Morocco and the US, especially in areas of counterterrorism and threat prevention. “We’ve got a lot in common with Morocco. We have a shared regional, I think, threat perception. We have excellent mil-to-mil cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation… It’s just a good-news story – the relationship,” said the first official. “They are a robust partner,” he said while recalling the joint military exercises with the Moroccan Royal Army: “We do more military exercises, training with Morocco – dozens if not a hundred a year… They’re the largest ones in the continent.” Morocco is “hawkish” against Iran The US officials expressed their surprise that the Moroccan officials were the ones to bring Iran into discussion. “It struck me – even in the foreign minister meeting – that this is one of the few meetings where we don’t bring up Iran first, that they were the first ones to bring up their concern about the financing of terrorism, the presence – or the influence of Hezbollah and of Iran in the region, and they were certainly quite hawkish,” noted the second official. His colleague mentioned the extradition of a Lebanese businessman linked to Hezbollah to the US after his arrest in Morocco. He then went on to talk about some “points of cooperation that might be so obvious,” giving the example of Venezuela. “Yeah. No, it’s amazing. I mean, so Morocco is a state that recognizes the Guaido government and is encouraging other states in Africa to recognize Guaido. They recognize the sort of pernicious, damaging ideology of Maduro and are helping promote that cause on the continent. So it’s great,” he explains. The official keeps on elaborating on the partnership between the US and Morocco to halt Iran’s influence in the region: “Morocco has its own interests in the regard, right? Iran is a regionally destabilizing force and has done activities that have proved destabilizing or attempted to be destabilizing in Morocco. So Morocco has excluded Iran – Iranian diplomats, for example, in the past, right? They are a partner. They support what we’re doing vis-a-vis the maximum pressure campaign.” Israel was not a discussion topic When asked about normalization with Israel, both officials said that it wasn’t a topic of discussion. “I don’t have a comment about – on that either, but to tell you the truth, that – it wasn’t a topic of discussion. I woke up today. I read the Times of Israel just like you guys did. And it struck me as just another Israeli leak to the press of their own issue. But it was coincident with our trip, but it wasn’t on our agenda,” one of them answered, denying reports by several Israeli and Moroccan news outlets about normalization with Israel being on the visit’s agenda. The US fears the Chinese influence The officials have also discussed the Chinese economic influence with their Moroccan counterparts. However, they did not give any details about the discussion. One official mentioned that Morocco recognizes “the challenges posed by Chinese involvement” without providing any explanation. Counterterrorism in the Sahel After citing recent arms purchases by the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces, the officials recalled that Morocco deploys “a huge number of peacekeepers throughout the region.” “They (Morocco) are also active in sort of counterterrorism initiatives along their borders,” he continued. The officials mention ISIS and al-Qaeda as Morocco’s “adversaries on their borders.” Morocco wants to attract American investors The State Department officials announced that Morocco wants to strengthen its business cooperation with the US, specifically through investments. “They want American companies. They have a number of American companies that are doing business there,” says one of the officials. No advancement on Western Sahara The officials mentioned the Western Sahara question as well, albeit briefly. When asked if the conflict is getting closer to resolution, one of the officials said that there was no progress made on the matter during the trip. “No, I mean, we’re about to get, as you know, a new representative from the UN. But – so there’s no advancement at all on that (Western Sahara conflict) from the trip.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a report of its Western Sahara-related activities in 2019, revealing that the year was marked by notable diplomatic gains and historic achievements  with regards to defending its territorial integrity.  The report listed all activities of the ministry to defend the “national cause” and to reinforce Morocco’s achievements over the past two decades. According to the ministry, the Western Sahara issue is one of  “top the Moroccan diplomacy’s priorities, in accordance with the insightful vision of King Mohammed VI.” Success in UN-led process The ministry emphasized that Morocco’s diplomacy managed to accomplish “very important results” through  successive UN Security Council resolutions this year.  One notably pro-Moroccan momentum in the ongoing UN-led political process was the 2468 resolution of April 2019.  The document called for “compromise” and “pragmatism” during the political process. Both the language and the recommendations appeared to embrace Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan. In  October, another UN document, ’Resolution upheld the exclusivity of the UN political process on different levels. With both resolutions  emphasizing the importance of the UN-led political process to reach a “realistic, pragmatic, and durable political solution based on compromise,” the ministry suggested that 2019 can be described as the year when the UN-led process decisively buried talks if referendum or self-autonomy. One of the important aspects of recent developments, according to the ministry, is the emphasis that all parties should be engaged in a good faith to contribute to the political process and  ensure its success. The fact thatthe resolutions also urged  “Algeria and the Polisario to show realism and a spirit of compromise, away from transcendent and unworkable solutions,” the statement argued, was a notable gain for Morocco. In its report, the ministry also recalled the adoption of Resolution 2494 in October 2019,which extended  the mandate of peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO for a period of one year. The ministry said the one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate“is a clear signal of its attachment to guaranteeing the smooth running of the political process, taking into account the regional context and the need to work to guarantee a total and serious commitment, for all the parties concerned by the Round-Table process.”  The report, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), was effusive about how  the resolution preserved Morocco’s “achievements, reiterating once again the preeminence of the Moroccan autonomy initiative, and welcoming [Morocco’s]  serious and credible efforts” to move the political process forward. The resolution also listed Polisario’s violations in buffer zone, calling on to refrain from “ any provocative act that would hinder the UN process.” The ministry also spoke about the decision of some countries to withdraw recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR, including Malawi, Zambia, El Salvador and Barbados.  “The Moroccan diplomacy has also foiled the maneuvers of enemies of territorial integrity, in a number of international organizations, whether linked to the presence of separatist elements or to the signing of draft agreements and memoranda of understanding to allow their participation,” the report added. The ministry also spoke about its efforts to shed light on the human rights violations committed in the Tindouf camps, urging the international community to intervene. Defending Morocco’s interests in AU The report reiterated that Moroccan diplomats  will continue to defend “the supreme interests of Morocco and promoting its legitimacy on the question of the Moroccan Sahara within the African Union. These efforts have produced a number of positive results.” The ministry said this year was also marked by the AU’s decision to refrainfrom condoning or initiating hostile actions against Morocco’s territorial integrity. “The African Union summits of February and July 2019 did not adopt any decision on the national question,” the report emphasized. The ministry also recalled that the AU expressed full support for the UN-led political process. Also noted in the report was the ministry’s commitment to continue to promote the new development model for the southern provinces of Morocco. The ministry concluded the report with the milestone achievements  after several countries vowed to open general consulates in Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara. Comoros officially opened its general consulate on December 18. Republic of the Gambia also promised to  open a Consulate in the city of Dakhla in the coming months. The ministry also emphasized the importance of the “adoption of the legal framework relating to the maritime borders of Morocco and its sovereignty over its maritime domain by delimiting the sea borders including the Moroccan Sahara.” The ministry considers the move as a confirmation of  “the Moroccan identity of the Sahara pursuant to the law.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Health has launched an initiative to offer children under the age of five free cancer treatment at all health institutions and public hospitals. The ministry made its announcement today, December 26, in a statement published on its official website. “The initiative comes within the framework of the royal instructions,” the statement said. It is also in line with the recommendation suggested during the 16th National Congress of the Rights of the Child  held on November 20-23 in Marrakech During the conference, government officials vowed to make challenges facing Moroccan children a “national priority.” The ministry said it has decided to provide free treatment to children under five years old, who do not have health coverage under the “basic compulsory [health] insurance.” The ministry, according to the statement, also urged institutions of the national health system, especially hospitals, to “take the necessary and appropriate measures to facilitate free access to preventive and curative [healthcare] for children under 5-years olds.” The initiative comes after the patients of cancer launched a campaign on social media to share their struggles about health issues and the expensive cost of cancer treatment in the country. Some patients shared videos to speak about their experiences. The campaign urged some activists to address a petition to the government, asking it to create a “Cancer Control Fund” through an amendment to the 2020 Finance Bill. Moroccan academic Omar Cherkaoui launched the petition, seeking the collaboration of all Moroccans to help collect signatures to back the proposal. Statistics shared by the ministry in 2017 indicated that 40,000 Moroccans are diagnosed with cancer each year. Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer among men in Morocco, representing  22% of all cases. Prostate cancer represents 12.6% and colorectal cancer accounts for 7.9 %. Breast cancer accounts for 36% of all cancer diagnoses among Moroccan women. Cervical cancer accounts for 11.2%, while thyroid cancer accounts for 8.6%. Colorectal cancer represents 5.9%.

Rabat – An exclusive video posted by FAR-Maroc, a Facebook page focused on Morocco’s military affairs, documents the suffering of thousands of Moroccans after they were expelled from Algeria in the aftermath of the 1975 Green March. The video, taken at the time of the expulsion, records the testimonies of Moroccans who had to leave Algeria following Morocco’s decision to hold a Green March in November 1975 to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty over its Sahara. Algeria, a supporter of the Polisario Front and its independence claims, expelled more than 40,000 Moroccans in 1976. The expulsion of Moroccans happened on the first day of Aid al-Adha, the “Festival of Sacrifice,” which is one of the two most important Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide each year. President Houari Boumediene ordered the expulsion of Moroccans on the sacred day. The video shows some Moroccans, men and women, explain how they felt desperate and disappointed with Algeria’s decision to send them back to Morocco. Heartbreaking testimonies The video shows some of them living in camps, with their household goods in the open air. Mohammed, a 12-year-old boy, is seen in disbelief in the video, barely speaking coherently. He appears to say that a policeman took him to a police station after discovering that he was Moroccan. “I went to school and a police inspector came. He asked for my birth certificate, and when he saw it, he knew I was Moroccan. He then took me to the police station. A bus came and I got on it, and here I am,” he told an interviewer.  When the journalist asked the boy about his mother, the child answered that she is till in Algeria. The interviewer asked another Moroccan man about his family. He said that he is hoping to bring his wife and children, still in Algeria, back to Morocco. When the interviewer asked him if it would be possible, he said, “I will remain like this, it’s destiny.” Interviewees described the psychological burden and the distress they felt to be separated from their families. Some, in painful resignation, explained how they would have to start from scratch, with no family or money. When the interviewer asked a young woman if she was angry, she said, “of course” she was angry. Losing everything behind in Algeria, she told the interviewer that she and her family will start from scratch. Another man said, “Moroccan people are more welcoming that other people, including Algerian people.” Algeria should apologize  The Moroccan military Facebook post asked readers when Algeria would “apologize and compensate the families that were expelled during the first day of Eid Al Adha in February in 1976.” Algeria made the expulsion because of Morocco’s Green March, due to Algeria’s opposing stance on the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria has been publicly defending the breakaway group and their “independence” claims over the region for many years. After his recent election, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune argued the issue of Western Sahara is “a question of decolonization.” Before his election, Tebboune said that tensions with Morocco and the closed border is not due to the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria closed the border with Morocco after the 1994 Asni terrorist attack in Marrakech, when Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerians. The perpetrators of the attack were of Algerian origin. Speaking about the closed border, Tebboune claimed that thousands of Algerians were stranded. He also said that Morocco should issue an official apology to Algeria so that the border can be reopened.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, has warned all banks to take precautionary steps because of an imminent risk of electronic money fraud by a method called “skimming.” The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) informed the bank of the risk. The central bank demanded that all take measures to avoid the occurrence of the crime. DGSN asked victims or witnesses of such operations to inform the nearest police station immediately. Criminals achieve fraud through “skimming” by hiding a camera and an electronic sensor in Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The device hacks the electronic banking data of the targeted ATM users, while the camera records their Personal Identification Number (PIN). The fraudsters then encode the stolen data into blank magnetic strip cards and use them to make fraudulent withdrawals. Police in Marrakech intercepted several “skimming” devices installed on ATMs of certain banks between December 13 and December 15. Many social media users have also shared videos showing the devices in several Moroccan cities. Moroccan tech-specialist, Amine Raghib, also made a video explaining how “skimming” works and how to prevent it. The blogger urged everyone to always try to shake the device where they input their cards into the ATM to see if it is fake. He recommended that ATM users check if there are any cameras installed in the corners of the machine as well.

Rabat – A Taste of Sahara, a Moroccan-Lebanese restaurant in Brighton, UK, served free food to the homeless on Christmas day. The owner of the restaurant told British news outlet the Argus that he wanted to alleviate loneliness. For Sabri Ben Ameur, Christmas is “one of our busiest times for us, but it makes me think about those who are homeless and alone.” Ben Ameur argued, “No one should be alone, unappreciated and we must  look out for each other regardless of race, belief and culture.” The restaurant’s menu offers multiple dishes to its customers, especially Lebanese dishes. A Taste of Sahara partnered with Brighton and Hove Muslim Forum for the initiative. The leader of the forum, Tariq Jung, said, “We should always remember and reflect on the challenges in our society, as we see homelessness on the increase in our city and around the country.” Jung added that the UK country is “strong” because it has a “diverse culture and vibrant communities.” “This is what makes our city great,” he concluded.

Rabat – A Spanish media outlet has linked a Spanish Air Force video of two F-18 jet fighters to the adoption of two laws redefining Morocco’s maritime border. Last week, the foreign affairs committee of the Moroccan parliament passed two laws to “reactualize” the limits of Morocco’s territorial waters. The move aimed to assert Morocco’s sovereignty over its entire maritime coasts, including its southern provinces.  The new laws modified and supplemented Law No.1.81, establishing an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles off the Moroccan coast The Spanish media was quick to react to Morocco’s move, painting it as a possible source of tensions with Spain.  In an article titled; ‘Spain exhibited its F-18s over the Canary Islands the day after Morocco approved extending its territorial waters,’ Confidencial Digital reported on  Spain’s determination to show off its military Tuesday arsenal to deter Rabat from implementing the provisions of the newly adopted laws. Spain’s deployment of its F-18 over the Canarian sea came just one day after Morocco’s house of councilors voted to adopt the law on Monday evening, December 16, the Spanish outlet insisted. El Confidencial Digital also confirmed that the Spanish Air Forces published the video on Facebook and Instagram on Thursday, December 17, before 9 a.m. The Spanish Air Forces did not provide the exact location of the scenes depicted in the video. All it said was that the F-18 took off from the Gando airbase in the Canarian Islands. The publication came at a time when no air defense maneuvers are being held, leading the Spanish media to speculate that the publication is a response to Morocco’s “reactualization” of its maritime borders.  “The publication did not obey any specific air defense maneuvers, nor was there any other data that would justify why that video was broadcast on that specific date,” wrote Confidencial Digital. Although the Spanish Air Force seems to possess a more modernized and powerful air fleet, the Spanish news outlet cited a number of military experts who believe that they cannot withstand their Moroccan counterparts. Morocco has acquired a fleet of state-of-the-art F-16s from the US. The fleet comes, with the latest surveillance equipment and missiles, in addition to a radar of 300 kilometers of range enabling the detection of the Spanish F-18’s equipped with 150 kilometer-range radar.  In addition to having a more powerful engine, the Moroccan F-16, equipped with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) sights with four hulls is believed to easily outmuscle the Spanish F-18. JHMCS allows the pilot to fix the fighter jet he wants to shoot down by turning his head and looking in its direction. The Spanish pilot, on the other hand, must be positioned in front of the target so that the launch system fixes it. Morocco has heavily invested in modernizing its air fleet and acquiring the latest generation of fighter jets and helicopters. The most recent military deal was on November 20, when the US State Department approved the sale of 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and related equipment to Morocco for an estimated cost of $4.25 billion. The equipment includes sophisticated attack and defense systems such as Fire Control Radars, anti-tank missiles, Air-to-air missiles, anti-helicopters, drones, and low-level aircraft as well as deadly bombs, in addition to modernized communication devices, sensors, and self-protection. The acquisition is part of Morocco’s five-year plan, established in 2017, to reach “regional supremacy” by modernizing the military equipment of its army, air force, and navy.  Morocco’s arms deals with the US this year involved the sale of $3.8 billion worth of 25 F-16 aircraft and associated equipment in March, in addition to the upgrading of Morocco’s existing fleet of F-16 fighter jets for a cost of $985 million. In total, Morocco’s arms acquisition from the US reached $10.3 billion in 2019, outranking Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – Retirement pensions from the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) in Morocco will increase by 5%, starting January 1, 2020, announced a spokesperson of the fund after a board meeting on Tuesday, December 24, in Casablanca. The minimum increase will be MAD 100 ($10) per month. According to recent statistics from Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), more than 400,000 retired Moroccans receive pensions from CNSS and will benefit from the increase. The measure was adopted by the fund’s administration council, chaired by Minister of Labor and Professional Integration Mohamed Amkraz. During the meeting, the council also exempted employers from paying the full amount of late-payment penalties, as long as they settle the outstanding amounts before the end of 2020. The reductions on penalties will vary from 90 to 30%, depending on the number of months accumulated. The increase aims to improve the economic situation of retired Moroccans, especially as living expenses are rising. However, it is not yet known how the increase will impact the pension fund’s solvency. In 2018, a report from Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE) found that CNSS has been operating on a “technical” deficit since 2018 and a total deficit in 2027. The council also predicted that CNSS reserves will run out by 2044 and called for a reform to ensure long-term financial balance. In an effort to shore up pension funds, the Moroccan government has privatized several public establishments. In November, Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun announced that the Moroccan Pension Fund (CMR) will buy five university hospital centers. The move is expected to generate money for the fund in the long term.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani chaired a meeting of the ministerial committee on Wednesday, December 25, in Rabat, to improve the 2020-2050 National Water Plan, before submitting it to the National Water Council. State-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that during the meeting, Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water Abdelkader Amara explained the plan includes the construction of dams, the connection of water basins, desalination projects, integrating all rural villages into drinking water supply systems, providing water for the development of sustainable agriculture, preserving ecosystems, and fighting pollution. The government will allocate MAD 383 billion to implement the 30-year-plan, reported MAP. “The plan is a roadmap to address water challenges for the next 30 years and is an extension of the priority water program approved by King Mohammed VI,” said El Othmani during the meeting. The head of government emphasized the need to set a timetable for its implementation after its adoption, according to a statement from the Department of the Head of Government. On July 17, the French Development Agency (AFD) lent Morocco’s National Office for Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) MAD 536 million to improve access to safe drinking water in the northern provinces of Al Hoceima, Driouch, Nador, and Taounate. Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb, and Minister of Town Planning and Housing Abdelahad Fassi Fihri attended the meeting.

Rabat – Morocco’s national police have arrested one of two men whom a Moroccan woman videoed threatening and harassing her. Throughout the week, the woman’s video went viral, documenting how the two men threatened and verbally abused her while she was driving. The victim is a Moroccan social media “influencer” who strongly denounced the men for threatening her. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has said that on Wednesday, December 25, the police arrested one suspect who appeared in the video. The statement said that the police “heard the victim, who suffered, while driving her personal car, a verbal and physical assault, combined with sexual harassment by the driver of a car and his companion.” Police added that they put the main suspect in custody for further investigation.  Police are also searching for the second suspect, who has been identified. DGSN added that the case is part of the “immediate and serious reaction of the national security services to complaints and denunciations of citizens lodged directly or published in the media.” Sexual harassment and public sexual assault is a crime in Morocco after the adoption of the 103.13 law against gender-based violence in 2018. Those found guilty of sexual harassment in public spaces by use of words, acts or signals of sexual nature for sexual purposes face sentences ranging from one to six months. Harassers will also be fined from MAD 2,000 ($208) to 10,000 ($1,039).

Rabat – Moroccans topped the list of visitors from January to October in the Moroccan city of Agadir, the capital of the Souss-Massa region in southern Morocco. A statement from the Regional Tourism Council announced on December 25 an increase of 2% in the total overnight stays in tourist establishments in Agadir compared to the same period in 2018. The tourism office recorded 4,641,882 total overnight stays in tourist accommodations in the first 10 months of 2019. Moroccans remain the top visitors in the city, with 1,090,205 overnight stays, up from 953,271 by the end of October 2018. The number represents an increase of 14%. Although Agadir says Moroccans represent the plurality its tourists, French tourists spend more nights in the city on average, with 1,400,964 overnight stays, an increase of more than 10% from last year. Germans are the third most common tourists in Agadir with 755,238 overnight stays. British tourists recorded 647,101 overnight stays, up from 559,050 in the same period last year. In October, Morocco’s Tourism Observatory Office (ONMT) said that the average spending per person per night had increased from MAD 751 (€70) in 2016 to MAD 810 (€76) in 2017. French tourists spent MAD 9.8 billion (€920 million) in Morocco in 2017, representing an increase of 9% compared to the same period in 2016. Along with its neighboring city, Marrakech, Agadir is one of Morocco’s top tourist destinations. The city is expected to attract more tourists if a railway is built between Marrakech and Agadir. In his televised speech on the 44th anniversary of the Green March in November, King Mohammed VI spoke about the economic potential of the city. The monarch regretted that despite Agadir’s central location, its resources, potential, and infrastructure remain issues that must be addressed soon to open up the region. The King asked the government to build a railway connecting Marrakech and Agadir. He also recommended a rail extension covering the regions south of Marrakech. He asked Moroccan authorities to give the suggestion “serious thought.” “It is not reasonable that some basic infrastructure should end at Marrakech, whereas the Souss-Massa region is actually the center of Morocco and has enormous potential,” the King argued.

Rabat – Spanish coast guards have rescued 200 undocumented migrants who embarked from Morocco on inflatable boats.  A spokesperson from the Spanish Sea Rescue Service told AFP that  coast guards made the rescue of people from three makeshift boats throughout the day on Tuesday, December 24. The list of irregular migrants includes men, women, and children. During the night, the coast guard rescued 11 people in the waters of the Strait of Gibraltar. They arrived in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The spokesperson said that 61 more people were rescued in the Affarain Islands. Coast guards then transported them to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The guards rescued another 61 irregular migrants who arrived at the Alboran Islet, 57 kilometers from the Moroccan coast. Members of the Spanish coast guard also rescued 22 migrants who wanted to reach the Canary Islands. The operation is part of efforts to combat irregular migration and rescue people who take risky boats to reach Europe. Morocco, both a transit and host country to immigrants, has also been intensifying efforts to combat irregular migration networks. According to the latest statistics from Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), police arrested 505 organizers of undocumented migration involved in 62 criminal networks that traffic people in 2019. Operations against irregular migration resulted in the arrest of 27,317 would-be migrants, including 20,141 of foreign nationality. Moroccans represented 26% of those arrested trying to migrate without documents.

Rabat – Dutch police chief Erik Akebroom has acknowledged that the Netherlands would not have been able to catch the leader of the Moroccan-Dutch “Mocro Maffia,” Redouane Taghi, without the help of Moroccan and Dubai police. Emirati police announced the arrest of Taghi in Dubai on December 16. Taghi was wanted for numerous murders and leading a mafia network in the Netherlands known as Mocro Maffia. The mafia group is known for drug trafficking and murder in the Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium. NL Times quoted Akerboom saying that he “personally thanked” his colleagues in Dubai and Morocco for their help in arresting Taghi. “Teamwork is sometimes a tired concept, but it’s the key to success in tackling … crime,” he said. Moroccan intelligence services are believed to have provided information that helped Dubai police to arrest Taghi, who was hiding out in the UAE. Taghi was also wanted in Morocco, on suspicion he was behind the Cafe La Cremeshooting in November 2017. Morocco believes that Taghi ordered the attack where gunmen in Marrakech shot and killed a medical student and injured his classmate. Dutch members of the mafia opened fire at the cafe before fleeing the scene. The students were not the intended targets, since the gunmen were after the cafe’s owner, Mustafa, also known as Moes. Moes is also allegedly involved in drug operations and stole €27 million from Taghi. Mocro maffia is involved in several criminal activities, including cocaine and cannabis trafficking and money laundering. Chilly diplomatic relationship Despite the success of the teamwork, Akerboom acknowledged that Dutch-Moroccan diplomatic relations are a “chilly political relationship.” Moroccan and Dutch diplomats recently rowed over Moroccan asylum seekers in the Netherlands. State Secretary Ankie Broekers-Knol claimed last month that the Moroccan government refused to talk to her about failed Moroccan asylum seekers. Morocco, however, denied ever having received a request for talks. “Neither our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rabat, nor [the Moroccan embassy] have been approached by the Dutch government for a request to talk about this,” a spokesperson of the Moroccan embassy in the Netherlands told the Dutch news outlet RTL Nieuws. The Moroccan ambassador then canceled his meeting with Broekers-Knol. In response, Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said that diplomatic relations between his country and Morocco must improve. For Blok, the canceled meeting “emphasized the importance of improving the two countries’ relations.” The Netherlands and Morocco have traditionally maintained stable diplomatic relations. However, the Netherlands’ comments on Morocco’s 2016-2017 Hirak Rif movement angered Morocco. The Netherlands criticized the prison sentences given to some Hirak Rif activists in 2018, causing Morocco’s foreign minister to summon the Dutch ambassador to Morocco. According to Gulf News, another diplomatic crisis erupted over Taghi’s deportation from the UAE to the Netherlands instead of Morocco.  NL Times reported that Morocco did not request Taghi’s extradition, but Gulf News quoted sources from Morocco who said that the North African country wants the Netherlands to extradite Moroccan Said Chao “in return for allowing Amsterdam to get Taghi, considering that the Dutch judiciary is refusing to extradite [Chao] to Morocco.” The Netherlands arrested Chaou in 2017 on charges of drug trafficking, corruption, and conspiracy. Morocco wants Chaou on charges of forming a criminal conspiracy network, intentional homicide, corruption, and international drug trafficking. The Moroccan justice department also suspects Chaou gave financial and logistical support for the Hirak Rif protests. Morocco sought Chaou’s repatriation in 2018, but the Netherlands refused, and the Dutch Supreme Court upheld the decision. Chaou was born in the Rif region of northern Morocco, and he served as a member of Parliament between 2007 and 2010.

Rabat – In a video called “My experience with Moroccan police,” American rapper Shawn Dinero said he was impressed by the “professionalism” of a Moroccan police officer. The video, uploaded on YouTube on December 10, shows the rapper and his wife sitting in the backseat of a taxi in Casablanca. A Moroccan police officer appears to be giving the taxi driver a ticket for using his phone while driving. The rapper and his wife expressed their surprise at the officer’s “calm” and “professionalism.” “The American police need to learn something from the police in Morocco, this guy has been so patient, so nice. His temperament for a police officer is ‘A1,’” said Dinero. According to the rapper’s wife, the taxi driver protested violently against the ticket. The security officer, however, remained calm and did not react in an aggressive way. “The [taxi driver] is yelling, going crazy on the phone with his boss. He even walked to the back of the car, opened up the trunk, like he was ready to dismiss us,” explained the woman. The police officer “has not at all yelled, screamed, told [the driver] to get out of the car, none of that. He has not done any of the above, only thing he has done is ask him for his registration document, have him sign his ticket, and be on his way,” she continued. The woman then compared the situation with her past experiences in the US: “This was not a scary confrontation as the ones we see in New York, or anywhere in the United States.” As the police officer was leaving, Dinero started praising him again. “This guy is professional right here. I like this guy. American police need to learn something from him… Kudos to the Moroccan police for doing their job. I commend you guys,” he said at the end of the video.

Rabat – A video of a Spanish barista denying service to a group of Moroccans at a Spanish restaurant has gone viral on social media. The video documents the moment when a Spanish employee at a Pans &amp; Company restaurant in Spain’s Girona region, near France, refused to serve three young people of Moroccan origin. The conversation in the video is primarily in Spanish. But at one point in the exchange, a Moroccan man says in Darija (Moroccan Arabic), “I swear I will film that.” Speaking in Spanish, one of the young men says, “This coffee is for everyone.” “This is the first time I’ve come here,” one of them says, explaining he is from an area north of Barcelona called Manresa. The employee argues, “There are a number of people who [we don’t let in]. I’m not going to serve you coffee because my boss doesn’t want to,” she said. Discriminació racista fa uns minuts al @PansandCo d l’estació dl #TAV de #Girona negant-se a servir cafè a persones joves racialitzades. No és un cas aïllat i ens neguem a normalitzar-ho.

The company, however, said it would open an internal investigation. ESPAI Antirracista, an anti-racism association in Girona, released the video on its Twitter, warning the cafe that it would report the act. Spanish Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family Chakir El Homrani, himself a Spaniard of Moroccan origin, has described the move as “intolerable.” On his Twitter, the minister said: “Not serving a client because of their origin is called racism.” La lluita contra el racisme és imprescindible per construir un país sense ciutadans de primera i ciutadans de segona.

Rabat – The former Polisario security officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud has again issued a strong condemnatory statement against the breakaway group Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Mustafa Salma has long criticized the Polisario Front and Algeria for human rights violations against Sahrawis, saying they are held against their will in the camps. On December 24, the former Polisario member asked rhetorically “For how long will Sahrawis remain hostage to the terrorist politics of the Polisario?” he asked. The comment followed the reelection of Ibrahim Ghali as secretary-general of the Polisario Front for a second term on December 24. Mustafa Salma believes that the structure of the Polisario Front will see no changes. “The system of the Polisario Front, which claims democracy remained a totalitarian authoritarian [group],” he said before denouncing human rights violations in the camps. “[Polisario’s] constitution governing Sahrawis contradicts all human rights laws and the rules of democratic systems,” he argued. Some pro-Polisario media outlets have been voicing concerns about Sahrawis in the camps, who are facing human rights violations, lack of freedom of movement, arbitrary detentions, malnutrition, and illnesses. Earlier this month, Sahrawi detainees at Al Rachid prison near Tindouf condemned human rights violations in a letter published by Futuro Sahara. The group of 126 Sahrawi detainees addressed the letter to the international community to draw attention to their plight. “Following the horrific [violence] we have been subjected to, we address the Sahrawi, international and regional public and the readers to share our suffering [with you],” the letter reads. The letter is not the first of its kind. However, only a few rights groups have condemned the human rights violations in the camps, including Human Rights Watch. The United Nations has also been silent in response to the letters and calls from Sahrawis in the camps. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefly mentioned the situation of former detainee and activist Aba Bouzid and his colleagues in his annual report to the UN on Western Sahara in October. Paragraph 71 of the report mentioned that the three activists, Fadel Braika,  Mahmoud Zidane, and Bouzid, were detained over protests about the situation in the camps. The report said that OHCHR informed UN of “the harassment, arrest, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment by Frente POLISARIO security forces of a human rights defender and a blogger engaged in documenting human rights violations in the region.” Subsequently released, the three had been arrested in June for participating in protests. Mustafa Salma condemned the “Constitution” of the self-proclaimed SADR for prohibiting any political parties and associations, according to Article 31. “Will the honorable Sahrawi people continue to accept this situation indefinitely?” Mustafa Salma asked, criticizing Ghali for his total control over Sahrawis and the camps.

Rabat – Morocco’s Special Commission on the Development Model (CSMD) is adopting a new communication strategy to engage Moroccans, using a digital platform to interact with civil society and citizens. The CSMD’s communication strategy will orient itself towards social networks. CSMD is seeking to hear from political parties, trade unions, private sector, and associations with a constructive, open spirit, according to the state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The commission has not yet indicated through MAP a web address where citizens can register their opinions. The decision came during the commission’s plenary meeting to discuss how it would interact with civil society, on Monday, December 23, at the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco in Rabat.  Subsequently, the committee will organize field meetings with citizens and various segments of Moroccan society, starting January 2. The CSMD also created a charter of rules on the obligations of its members. Under the principles stipulated in the charter, committee members will participate voluntarily, without compensation or taking any benefits. Two Moroccan journalists, Aicha Akalay and Abdellah Tourabi, will head up the commission’s communication with all the media. Headed by Morocco’s ambassador to France, Chakib Benmoussa, the CSMD is tasked with making recommendations for reforms in Morocco to address ongoing issues of social and economic disparity and gaps in education, health, business, and investment.

Rabat – Morocco has declared it is ready to work with Indonesia to build a league of senates and consultative “shura” councils that would promote a positive image of Islam and defend against offences targeting Muslim people or the religion of Islam. Morocco’s House of Councillors President Hakim Benchamach made the announcement during a meeting with the Indonesian People’s Consultative Assembly President Bambang Susilo in Rabat, on Tuesday, December 24. Susilo pleaded for the launch of the Islamic league to regroup parliamentary representatives from Islamic countries in defense of Islam and Muslims around the world. Benchamach expressed Morocco’s willingness to take part in the project. The Indonesian official also expressed his country’s wish to develop economic relations with Morocco. Morocco is a strategic partner for Indonesia in the North African region, affirmed Susilo. The politician reiterated Indonesia’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and for the efforts made by Morocco and the United Nations to solve the Western Sahara conflict. Benchamach also expressed Morocco’s interest in starting a new, promising, and fruitful era of bilateral cooperation. Historical and diplomatic relations between Morocco and Indonesia are strong, said the Moroccan official, recalling the participation of a Moroccan delegation in the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia. The Bandung Conference was the first large-scale Afro-Asian conference. It was a meeting of Asian and African states on April 18-24, 1955. Both officials pledged to improve the partnership between the two countries and contribute to their shared project. The Indonesian ambassador to Morocco, representatives from the Moroccan House of Councillors, and the president of the Morocco-Indonesian friendship group also took part in the meeting. Diplomatic relations between Morocco and Indonesia have been growing stronger in recent months. In October 2019, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita met with the Indonesian vice-president, Maaruf Amin, in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. The two officials agreed to solidify bilateral cooperation on a range of issues, including education and culture.

Rabat – French Minister of Ecological and Inclusive Transition Elisabeth Borne has been facing backlash for taking a holiday trip to Marrakech, Morocco, amid the transportation strike and continuous protests over pension reform in France. French media and internet users strongly criticized the French official for going on a holiday trip during the crisis. French author Olivier Marteau wrote on his Twitter that Borne “asked French people not to consume too much on Black Friday, because according to her it was bad for the climate. And then she left for a weekend in Marrakech.” Élisabeth Borne avait demandé aux Français de ne pas trop consommer au Black Friday car selon elle c’était mauvais pour le climat. Et là elle est donc partie en week-end à Marrakech. 👌 pic.twitter.com/RJkfa5eHOf — Olivier Marteau (@MarteauOlivier) December 25, 2019 Journalist Nils Wilcke also criticized the minister. “Hello everyone, amid strike against pension reform, our minister of ecology, Elisabeth Borne, took a flight to Marrakech … and Merry Christmas,” he said. L’excuse de Matignon? “Élisabeth Borne a beaucoup donné au pays cette année” Ah… Le conseiller d’Edouard Philippe de perm n’était même pas au courant de ces vacances au Maroc. Youpi! https://t.co/z0yY8TsPaI #Marrakech #Retraites #Greves — Nils Wilcke (@paul_denton) December 25, 2019  Le Parisian reported that the minister took a commercial flight at her own expense for a few days’ holiday. “She will join her office” again next week, Le Parisian added. Transportation workers in France have been on strike over pension reforms for more than two weeks. French President Emmanuel Macron said that strikes should not “ruin” the Christmas holiday, calling for a suspension of the strike. “A strike action is justifiable and protected by the Constitution, but I believe there are moments in the life of a nation when it is also good to call a truce to respect families and family life,” Macron said from Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, where he visited last week.  Despite Macron’s statement, families in France have been stranded in train stations due to cancelled trains and “gridlocked roads,” according to the BBC. Flights have also been canceled. Macron said that suspending strikes for the holidays does not mean that labor unions should forget about their demands.

Rabat – In the last 20 years, 680,000 people have graduated from private vocational training centers, representing 32% of the global number of vocational training graduates in Morocco. Minister of Education Said Amzazi announced the numbers during a seminar in Marrakech on Tuesday, December 24. The seminar focused on “the perspectives of development in the private vocational training sector.” The private sector “undeniably contributes” to the training and production of a skilled workforce, well-adapted to the job market, according to the minister. “Since the promulgation of law 13-00 about the status of [private vocational training], around 680,000 vocational training graduates have followed their courses in private establishments for vocational training, in several fields representing the diverse sectors of national economy,” said Amzazi. Law 13-00, implemented in May 2000, regulates vocational training in the private sector. Vocational training has been one of the main focuses of the Moroccan government’s strategy to improve Moroccans’ socio-economic conditions. In his 2019 Revolution Day speech, on August 20, King Mohammed VI recommended vocational training as a way to reduce the unemployment rate and social disparities. “Promoting vocational training is now an urgent necessity, not just to create employment opportunities, but also to enable Morocco to meet the challenge of economic competitiveness and keep abreast of global developments,” said the monarch. The King also urged the private sector to participate in the country’s new development model. Addressing Parliament at the legislative year opening, on October 11, King Mohammed VI called the private sector to become an active and integral part of Morocco’s development. In December 2018, the secretary of state for higher education, Khalid Samadi, said that people who gain qualifications from vocational training schools are more likely to find jobs. A research report by the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training found that 63% of students with vocational qualifications find jobs within nine months of graduation, Samadi added. Unemployment rate in Morocco in the second quarter of 2019 was 8.5%, according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP). “The number of unemployed people has declined from 1,103,000 to 1,026,000, following a drop of 77,000 in unemployed people,” the HCP said. The unemployment rate in urban areas is significantly higher, 12.4%, than it is in rural areas, where the rate is 3.3%.

Rabat – The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) in Morocco arrested eight people on suspicion of links with illegal immigration and human trafficking network, on Tuesday morning, December 24. The police also arrested an irregular migrant at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport. The arrest was carried out based on information provided by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) to the BCIJ. After searching the suspects’ houses, police seized foreign residence cards, falsified visas, a batch of passports, electronic devices, mobile phones, stamps, and three cars, said the BCIJ in a statement. The police took the suspects into custody for further investigation to identify any other persons involved in the case or links between the criminal network in Morocco and other networks abroad, the statement added. Uncovering and dismantling human trafficking networks is part of Morocco’s security operations against organized crime. In its annual crime statistics, the DGSN said police arrested 505 organizers of undocumented migration who were part of 62 human trafficking networks. In 2019, the DGSN says it arrested 27,317 people attempting to migrate irregularly. The majority, 20,141, were non-Moroccan.

Rabat – Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi has made it to the much-coveted shortlist of 2019 CAF Awards, making the young Moroccan player one of African football’s most successful–and talented–representatives for the past year.  The online portal for the African Football Confederation unveiled the list of the finalists on December 22. Hakimi, who currently plays for Germany’s Borussia Dortmund, is competing for the Young African Player of the Year award along with Nigeria’s Samuel Chukwueze and Victor Osimhen. CAF selected three options for each category, with Hakimi the only Moroccan still in the race.  The preliminary list included Hakim Ziyech and other football players from the Moroccan league. Hakimi’s performance with his German club earned him a place in the shortlist. On loan from Real Madrid, the young Moroccan’s stellar, consistent form since joining the German league has drawn plaudits from football writers and fans around the world.  The Guardian recently ranked the young Moroccan 90th in its highly regarded list of the 100 best male footballers in the world.  “The Moroccan, who arrived from Spain with a mere 17 first-team games under his belt in the summer of 2018, has developed into one of the most consistent and attack-minded full-backs in Europe during his time at Dortmund. He has scored twice against both Internazionale and Slavia Prague in the Champions League this season and can play at left- or right-back or left or right midfield. Dortmund want to sign him permanently but Hakimi is set on only one thing: being a success at Real,” the British newspaper said of the Moroccan footballer. But Hakimi has also been a key element with Morocco’s national team during qualifier games for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Despite his young age (he had not yet turned 20)  while representing Morocco at the most recent World Cup in Russia, Hakimi was commanding a commanding presence on the wings for the Moroccan Atlas Lions.  Hakimi already received the African Young Player of the Year in 2018. CAF will announce the winners on January 7, 2020, in an award ceremony that will take place in Egypt. The list of awards includes African Player of the Year, with Mohamed Salah of Egypt competing for the prize along with Algeria’s Riyad Mahrez and Senegal’s Sadio Mane.

Rabat – Italian giant club Juventus surprised the Arab world with jerseys with Arabic calligraphy during the Italian Super Cup against Lazio on Sunday, December 22. Juventus played the match in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Lazio won the Super Cup with 3-1. Moroccan-Saudi Calligrapher Shaker Kashgari helped Juventus and its official equipment provider Adidas to design the Jersey with Arabic calligraphy. Prior to the game, the calligrapher expressed joy over the collaboration with Juventus and Adidas on his social media. “I am honored and glad to work and collaborate with @juventus and @adidasfootball to work on their Calligraphy special edition for the Italian Super Cup that will be played in Riyadh, to write the club names on players jerseys,” he said. The jerseys have the names of the players in Arabic, with the numbers adorned with Arabic calligraphy. “The limited edition adidas uniform will have within each single number a traditional Arabic calligraphic design that highlights the word Juventus, with the name of each individual player written in Arabic,” Juventus wrote. Juventus Chief Revenue officer Giorgi Ricci said that the choice sought to “pay tribute to a traditional art form.” For Kashgari,  “Arab culture is rooted in pride and passion; the same that football teams, players and fans all over the world have.” He explained that Calligraphy is one of the “oldest traditions.” The move came during the week when the world celebrated the Arabic language, suggesting the Italian club was paying tribute to its many Arab fans around the world. The international  Arabic Language Day is celebrated annually on December 18. Arabic is the official language of 25 countries in the world and is spoken by more than 300 million people.

Washington DC – In a move that clearly violates the spirit and principles of the UN-led political process, the ceasefire agreement, the Military Agreement 1, and UN Security Council resolutions, the Polisario Front held its 15th congress in Tifariti, in the buffer zone in Western Sahara, on December 20-23.  The boldness of Polisario’s move, its disregard for the UN political process, and the silence of the United Nations cast uncertainty about the future of the political process and raise serious questions about the impartiality of UN personnel involved in the day-to-day management of the territorial dispute.  Morocco should ask the UN for clarifications  Morocco needs to move quickly and ask the United Nations for clarifications regarding the UN’s failure to fulfill its obligations in Western Sahara under the 1991 ceasefire agreement and the provisions of the Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 2414 and 2440, 2468 and 2494. In Resolution 2414, the Security Council expressed concern about the presence of Polisario in the buffer zone of Guerguerat and called for Polisario’s withdrawal from the region. The Security Council also called for Polisario to refrain from transferring any administrative facilities to Bir Lahlou.  Additionally, Resolution 2440 called on the parties to refrain from any actions that could undermine the political process and specifically called on Polisario to “adhere fully to its commitments to the Personal Envoy in respect of Bir Lahlou, Tifariti and the buffer strip at Guerguerat.” Morocco should also urge the UN to clarify the circumstances of MINURSO mission representatives attending a congress held by the Polisario Front in the buffer zone. The UN’s silence and its non-condemnation of Polisario’s provocative move of holding its congress in the buffer zone—especially the presence of MINURSO representatives at the event—cast suspicions about the impartiality of the UN in the stalled political process.   By failing to put pressure on Polisario and to demand that they abide by Security Council resolutions, the UN would be aiding and abetting Polisario, enabling it to persist in its false claims that the area east of Morocco’s sand wall—the berm running from north to south in Western Sahara—falls within the “liberated areas” under the alleged control of Polisario. If this move goes undeterred, Polisario would feel emboldened and might decide that the time is ripe for it to transfer its administrative facilities to the buffer zone.  Morocco should use Polisario’s move in the kingdom’s favor and demand the UN Secretariat and the Security Council intervene firmly to enforce the recent Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 2414 and 2440. Morocco should also urge Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to issue a statement condemning Polisario for its congress in the buffer zone. Secondly, Guterres should apologize to Morocco for the attendance of MINURSO representatives at the congress, condemn the reckless move, and emphasize the UN’s neutrality and its concern not to sympathize with or favor any party in the conflict.  In this regard, Morocco should make it clear that the statement issued by Stephane Dujarric, the personal spokesman of the United Nations Secretary-General, on Monday, December 23, in which he said that the attendance of representatives of the MINURSO mission at the congress does not reflect their position nor that of MINURSO, does not dispel suspicion about UN partiality, nor does it put any pressure on Polisario.  For the UN spokesman to admit that Polisario held its congress in the buffer zone without expressing the Secretary-General’s concern about the step and its negative impact on the political process, is itself problematic and reflects the UN’s inability or unwillingness to enforce full respect for Security Council resolutions on all parties. By the same token, Morocco should demand that the Secretary-General state unequivocally that Polisario does not have any sovereignty over the buffer zone east of the Moroccan defense wall in Western Sahara and list the violations in his annual report to the Security Council in October 2020. Additionally, Morocco should send letters to the permanent members of the Security Council to inform them both about the violations of MINURSO’s personnel of UN neutrality and the danger the congress poses to the region’s stability.  Morocco should make clear that it will spare no efforts to protect its rights and interests and prevent any party from changing the status quo of the region through a fait accompli.  On the other hand, Morocco should make its approval of the future personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara contingent on the UN’s commitment to formally declare that Polisario’s recent provocative steps are blatant violations of the Security Council resolutions.  In the same vein, Morocco should require the UN to threaten sanctions if Polisario persists in violating Security Council resolutions and threatening the viability of the political process.  Moroccan diplomats should remind the international community that Morocco did not vacate the buffer zone in 1991 to allow the Polisario to assert its sovereignty over it, but rather as a sign of good faith and of its intention to pave the way for the UN to kick start its political process to help the parties reach a final solution to the dispute. Morocco should also signal its willingness to enter the buffer zone and extend its control over it if the Security Council and the UN Secretariat fail to discharge their responsibility to maintain peace and security in the region, as well as the viability of the political process. UN silence raises doubt of its impartiality  The credibility of the UN Secretariat and the Security Council and their ability to play a mediating role in conflict resolution and in maintaining international peace and security are at stake.  Any UN failure to remind Polisario of the rules and principles of the political process and the provisions of the Security Council resolutions would undermine the confidence of member states in the UN’s ability to fully and successfully mediate in the conflicts on its agenda, including Western Sahara.   It is not the first time that Polisario has violated the requirements of resolutions 2414 and 2440 and the spirit of the UN-sponsored political process. In early January of this year, the Polisario militia carried out what it called military exercises in the Mhiriz region, in the buffer zone. The action was provocative behavior that could lead to unprecedented tension in the region and threaten its stability and security. This is also not the first time that UN personnel have been implicated in dubious actions that raise doubts about its credibility, the integrity of its personnel, and their eligibility to mediate the conflict.  In 2013, a video surfaced showing a former MINURSO employee, from Egypt, inciting Polisario against Morocco, calling Morocco an “invader” and urging Polisario supporters to rise up against Morocco.  The video caused an unprecedented uproar, eliciting the ire of the Moroccan government and the Moroccan people. The UN eventually opened an investigation and terminated the MINURSO member’s contract. Furthermore, in March 2016, then Secretary-General of the UN Ban Ki-Moon visited the Tindouf camps and described Morocco as an “occupier” of Western Sahara. Morocco was swift in denouncing Ban Ki-Moon’s statement and questioning his credibility and eligibility to play a mediating role in the conflict.  The statements resulted in unprecedented tension between Morocco and the UN Secretariat and widened the gap of distrust between the two parties. Nevertheless, the election of Antonio Guterres as Secretary-General of the UN helped restore and rekindle a certain degree of trust between the two parties.  However, the UN Secretariat’s continued silence about the violations of Polisario and the presence of MINURSO representatives at the congress in the buffer zone may again raise doubts about the integrity of those in charge of the file at the UN. The UN must step in to deter Polisario and save the political process  In light of the Secretary-General’s continued silence about the repeated provocations of the Polisario in the buffer zone, in addition to his refusal to mention, even briefly, the involvement of the Polisario and Algerian leadership in embezzling humanitarian aid directed to the Tindouf camps for more than four decades, how can Morocco trust the integrity of the UN team that drafts the annual report on the conflict?  How can Morocco continue to deal with the various parties involved in the conflict in good faith as long as the UN does not deter Polisario and does not ensure that it fully respects the provisions of Security Council resolutions? Unless the UN remedies the situation and affirms its neutrality and its keenness to deal firmly with any violation of Security Council resolutions, it will be impossible for the parties to achieve any progress in the political process in the foreseeable future.  The UN’s unfathomable silence about the repeated provocations of Polisario could hammer the final nail in the coffin of the UN-led political process, causing Morocco to lose confidence in the UN’s neutrality in the process. If the UN wishes to maintain some hope that the political process will result in any tangible progress in the future and to maintain the momentum generated by the two round tables held in December 2018 and March 2019 in Geneva, it must act quickly and condemn the provocative and reckless move of Polisario.  The UN should also send a clear and strong message to Polisario that, after repeatedly violating Security Council resolutions, it no longer has a margin of maneuver, and that any provocative step may expose it to sanctions.

Rabat – In his first interview following his release from a Los Angeles intensive care unit (ICU), French Montana implied that Moroccan witchcraft played a role in his hospitalization.  Sitting down with YouTuber DJ Akademiks in early December, the rapper explained that he had taken his mother to visit her brothers and sisters in Morocco after his birthday on November 9. She had not seen her family for more than 20 years, he said.  “She sacrificed so I could be French Montana,” he told DJ Akademiks, referring to his family’s immigration to the US when he was just 13 years old.  The rapper, born Karim Kharbouch in Casablanca, described how he stayed diligently by his mother’s side while she visited her Moroccan relatives.  “When you don’t see nobody for 25 years you basically don’t know the person, so I wanted to make sure that I left her in the right hands [sic].” He hinted that he did not trust the people he had been with during the visit.  “All people see out there in Africa is money, that’s why nobody make it out [sic]. And I know that’s the root of all evil.” French Montana went on to detail his brush with witchcraft.  “I think I ate something bad. I think someone was trying to … you know,” he trailed off. “They don’t got no guns over there, they fight with spirits and s**t like that [sic].” He said that he remembered eating something which caused him to hallucinate.  “So, like food poisoning?” the interviewer asked. “Yeah, but in they own way [sic],” French Montana replied. “They call it s’hur over there.”  S’hur refers to the use of magical curses and magical poisoning in the Moroccan dialect of Arabic (Darija). It is known as Moroccan witchcraft or black magic. The rapper did not offer further elaboration and instead went on to describe how the combination of his international travels, his birthday celebrations, and his aspirations to drop his new album became “a suicide mission.”  In late November, Los Angeles police made a medical call on French Montana’s behalf while responding to a separate incident at a house party. The officers noted that he looked unwell, and he spent more than a week in the hospital.  French Montana revealed that he would have likely died if he had not gone to the hospital when he did.

Rabat – Just weeks before Morocco’s Amazigh (Berber) people celebrate their new year, Moroccan researcher Abdel Rahman Farkish has publicly shared controversial opinions about the historicity of the Amazigh new year and about Tifinagh, the alphabet used to write the Amazigh language. Every year at this time, Amazigh activists renew several demands of the government, including to make January 12 an official holiday as the Amazigh new year’s day. The year 2020 will be the Amazigh New Year 2970. The origin of “Yennayer,” the Amazigh new year, goes back to 950 BC, some say. The date marks the victory of the Amazigh army, led by the Berber king Sheshonq,” also spelled “Chichanq,” over the pharaoh’s army to conquer Egypt. But some, like Farkish, question the story, saying Yennayer is not historical. Farkish believes that, in the past, there was nothing called an Amazigh year. “The celebration of the Amazigh year is caused by the search for an Amazigh identity, but this research should be based on accepted scientific foundations as it should not be a … historical lie.” The researcher described the Amazigh year as a “historical lie” in an interview with Arabic news outlet al Ousboue. In Morocco, Amazigh people celebrate the year even though it is not an official public holiday. Read Also: The Disappearing Tradition of Amazigh Facial and Body Tattoos The celebration of Yennayer, however, has been an official national holiday in Algeria since 2017. When al Ousboue asked the researcher about Yennayer, he said “It is an invention by some Kabyle Amazigh in Algeria, belonging to the Berber Academy in Paris.” Kabyle are an Amazigh ethnic group in the north of Algeria. Farkish added that the Berber Academy is known for its “bigotry against Arabs and against everything that is from the Arab history in North Africa.” He argued that Europeans did not accept the transformation of the Mediterranean Sea from a “Christian Lake” surrounded by Christian peoples to a sea with “Muslim south.” He said Europeans believe Arabs are responsible for the conversion of peoples to Islam. “Since then French historians and some Christians have been concerned with trying to Re-Christianize the lake as it was,” he said. Farkish also had controversial things to say about the Amazigh language, although he acknowledged its importance. “Amazigh is an essential component in the Maghreb and no one doubts that the Amazigh are a component of Morocco and the Amazigh language should be encouraged.” He also praised the fact that Amazigh became an official language, alongside Arabic, in the new Constitution. However, he argued, “The Amazigh awakening should not be at the cost of Moroccan cohesion between Arabs and Berbers because it is related to a war between two languages and two cultures.” The researcher said Tifinagh, the Amazigh alphabet, was an invention from France to ignite a civil war in Morocco between Arabs and Amazigh. ‘You cannot just say it’s a French invention’ Abdelwahed Driouche, an Amazigh activist and a member of the House of Councillors in Parliament discounted Farkish’s comments in a statement to Morocco World News, saying that he does not agree with what Farkish said. He said that all people have the right to enjoy their cultural and historical identities. “Among the rights is the ability to acknowledge the identity” of Amazigh people, Driouche said. He added that identity is linked to history. “You cannot just come and say it is a fiction and that it is a French conspiracy and a French invention,” Driouche argued. Such claims and unacceptance of others, the MP said, can lead to extremism and terrorism. “All we want is coexistence. This is how Morocco will promote cultures and tourism.” Driouche said activists are now, and will always be, calling for an official holiday to celebrate Amazigh new year’s day. King Mohammed VI, the activist said, should make the decree. Driouche added that many people opposed the decision to declare the Amazigh language an official language. “But it happened, so we are asking for the Amazigh year to be official by a royal decision.” In June, Morocco’s Commission of Education, Culture, and Communication also adopted a law confirming that the Amazigh language should be written with the Tifinagh alphabet. Tifinagh, also called the Lybic script, was used in the North Africa region from 2000 BC to the 3rd century AD.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasna presided over the annual diplomatic charity gala dinner, organized by the Australian embassy in Morocco and the Diplomatic Foundation, on Monday, December 23, in Rabat. The dinner is an annual tradition that brings together diplomats, businessmen, and artists to aid people in precarious situations. It aims to collect funds that will improve social work in Morocco through financing NGO projects in the fields of health, education, and training. During the event, the Australian ambassador to Morocco, Berenice Owen-Jones, expressed her gratitude for Princess Lalla Hasna’s engagement in charity work. Australia’s participation in the gala is “not only a great honor,” but also “a strong symbol of the strong links between Morocco and Australia,” she added. The opening of the Australian embassy in Rabat, the first in Francophone Africa, in 2017 has contributed to overcoming the “distance tyranny” created by the 20,000 kilometers separating Morocco and Australia, said Owen-Jones. Despite the distance, Morocco and Australia “share the same values of solidarity, sharing, and mutual aid,” she concluded. The Diplomatic Foundation’s president, Abdelati Habek, also expressed his gratitude towards Princess Lalla Hasna for chairing the event. The funds collected during the dinner will go to the Association Al Ihssane for children, chaired by the princess, explained Habek. Princess Lalla Hasna shared a table with Minister of Solidarity Jamila El Moussali, Minister Delegate for Foreign Affairs Mohcine Jazouli, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region Governor Mohamed Yacoubi, and the Australian ambassador, among other officials. Several artists animated the gala dinner, including Hamza Labied, winner of The Voice Kids Arab in 2018; Fatima Zahra Laaroussi; Mohamed Adly; and Australian singers Ayse Shanal and Eleanor Hill from the Queensland Symphony Orchestra.

Rabat – Morocco’s national airline Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has announced it will launch a new direct flight between Casablanca and Beijing on January 16, 2020. RAM made the announcement at a press conference on Monday, December 23, in Beijing. The new flight will connect Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport with the 3-month-old Beijing Daxing International Airport, explained RAM’s regional director in China, Adil Khalloufi. It will be the first direct flight between Morocco and China. Passengers will fly aboard a new generation of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner for the 13-hour flight. The Dreamliner offers 302 seats, including 26 in business class. Starting January 16, three flights will become available weekly from Casablanca to Beijing and vice versa. Flights from Casablanca will operate Monday, Thursday, and Saturday, while flights from Beijing will be available on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. RAM hopes that the new route will increase the flow of passengers between the two countries. Morocco’s deputy ambassador to China, Mourad Ayachi, noted that the new flight will improve Morocco-China cooperation. The Moroccan diplomat recalled the official visit of King Mohammed VI to China in May 2016 and the signature of several cooperation agreements. Morocco was the first country in the region to sign the Belt and Road Initiative memorandum, a development strategy consisting of partnerships between China and 152 countries, said Ayachi. Human and cultural exchange between the two countries has seen an exponential rise in recent years, with 350,000 Chinese tourists visiting Morocco this year, more than five times the number of Chinese tourists in 2016 when King Mohammed VI decided to remove visa requirements for Chinese nationals, added Ayachi. Morocco and China will celebrate the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relations in 2020. To commemorate the occasion, both countries are organizing special events in their capitals. RAM continues to offer new flights, and next year it will officially join the oneworld airline alliance. Moroccan officials from the embassy and the Moroccan Tourism Office in Beijing attended the press conference on Monday, along with Chinese representatives of the aviation sector.

Rabat – The United Nations has issued an official statement to affirm its position on the Western Sahara conflict after two officials from the UN peacekeeping mission, also known as MINURSO, were seen attending a Polisario congress in an unauthorized zone. Last week, a photo described as provocative by Moroccan media went viral on social media, showing MINURSO blue helmets attending the 15th Polisario congress in the highly sensitive region of Tifariti, claimed as a “liberated zone” by the breakaway movement. The self-proclaimed SADR holds a congress annually. In response, Moroccan media strongly condemned the action and the attendance of MINURSO, which has a mission to maintain neutrality in the conflict and monitor the ceasefire agreement and the confinement of Polisario troops to designated areas. Following the backlash, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that MINURSO officials were in the region as “part of their routine monitoring of developments in the Territory.” Dujarric added that the MINURSO members are part of the UN military observer team in Tifariti, and they “decided to visit the site of the congress.” The UN spokesperson then reassured Morocco that both the blue helmets left “shortly” after the ceremony began and “returned to their team site.” Dujarric also argued that the “brief” presence of the two MINURSO members does “not imply any political position on the part of the observers or MINURSO, which remains strictly impartial in the fulfillment of its mandate.” “That’s it,” he concluded. The UN considers Polisario’s administrative buildings in Tifariti to be a violation of the ceasefire and related resolutions. The UN Secretary-General recently published his report on the situation before the Security Council’s vote on MINURSO’s mandate in October, in which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres informed the Security Council of Polisario’s violations. Guterres said that Polisario failed to “comply with requests by MINURSO” to resolve some violations. He also warned that Polisario representatives have not been responsive to warnings to remove buildings “recently constructed by Frente Polisario in various locations outside the restricted area.” Despite warnings, the Polisario Front held a “national” conference in Tifariti on December 15 in preparation for the congress. During the first meeting, Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali threatened the UN and accused the Security Council of lack of “responsibility.” In the speech, Ghali said Polisario “cannot continue dealing with the United Nations endeavor unless the Security Council bears its responsibility.”

Rabat – A recent campaign for free cancer treatment in Morocco has earned compassion and solidarity from ordinary Moroccans, public figures, and academics. Omar Cherkaoui, a Moroccan academic, is asking the government to create a “Cancer Control Fund” through an amendment to the 2020 Finance Bill. A professor at the Faculty of Law in Mohammedia, Cherkaoui prepared the petition to give cancer patients free treatment. The academic said that he and other people for the initiative will start distributing the petition to get signatories to regional coordinators. The petition committee will seek the collaboration of all Moroccans to help collect signatures. Charkaoui wrote on his Facebook that the campaign seeks to “reduce the burden on thousands of cancer patients.” The petition comes just weeks after some cancer patients and survivors of the illness across Morocco launched a campaign under the hashtag “We don’t want to die of cancer,” or “mabghinach nmouto bsaratan” in Moroccan Darija. The campaign is addressed to the health ministry and the government to improve health care for cancer patients in Moroccan hospitals and also calls for free treatment.  Some of the patients also posted videos to tell the public about the struggles and health issues they face on a daily basis. They also complained about the high cost of cancer treatment in Morocco. Cancer is horrifically increasing in Morocco, according to television channel 2M. Charkaoui said that the success of the national petition, in accordance with Article 15 of the Constitution, “requires the presence of regional coordinators, to ensure the collection of signatures.”  He called for sympathetic Moroccans to ask for more information if they want to help by collecting signatures in their region. Chrkaoui’s Facebook post gained huge exposure on social media, with thousands of people reacting and sharing his post. Some commenters also proposed their names to act as coordinators to collect signatures. Statistics from 2017 indicate that nearly 40,000 Moroccans are diagnosed with cancer each year. Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer among men in Morocco with 22% of all cases. Prostate cancer represents 12.6% and colorectal cancer accounts for 7.9 %. Breast cancer accounts for 36% of all cancer diagnoses among women. Cervical cancer accounts for 11.2%, while thyroid cancer accounts for 8.6%. Colorectal cancer represents 5.9%. It remains to be seen how successful the petition will be in gathering signatories and how the government will respond.

Rabat – The US Department of State has taken back 10 “antiterrorism assistance” dogs from Morocco, announced the US Office of the Inspector General (OIG). “In August 2019, 10 [Department of State Antiterrorism Assistance] canines were repossessed from Morocco because the dogs were not being used for their intended purpose,” says a report declassified this month. Morocco has received a number of dogs trained to find explosives under the US Department of State’s antiterrorism assistance program. The document did not give further specifics on the reasons behind the repossession. However, it gave examples of trained dogs dying of maltreatment in other countries benefiting from the program, such as Jordan and Egypt. OIG published the report, titled “Management Assistance Report: Continued Health and Welfare Concerns for Antiterrorism Assistance Explosive Detection Canines,” in December 2019 after the Department of State declassified it. The report evaluated the health and welfare of trained US canines in their host countries. Antiterrorism assistance dogs are part of the cooperation between Morocco and the US in security and counterterrorism. On December 5, the head of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) in Morocco, Abdellatif Hammouchi, received US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Several top security officials from both the US and Morocco attended the meeting. The US State Department has commended Morocco’s leadership in security in annual reports throughout the years. In its latest Country Report on Terrorism, the Department of State reiterated that Morocco has a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism. However, while Morocco is known for its top-notch security and intelligence services, some animal rights activists deplore the state of animal welfare. In recent weeks, disturbing videos surfaced online, showing starving stray dogs at an Agadir dog pound forced to eat each other. The dogs appeared malnourished and distressed in the videos. Earlier in December, local authorities in Dar Bouazza, near Casablanca, slaughtered around 80 stray dogs. Shocking footage documenting the slaughter went viral on social media, prompting animal welfare activists to question the government’s promises of using sterilization instead of slaughter to decrease Morocco’s stray dog population.

 Rabat – In recent weeks, many rumors circulated around the web accusing 2M television channel of launching a paid subscription of €4.99 for Moroccans living abroad. Several news outlets shared the story, including Hespress, the largest Moroccan online newspaper. The channel, however, has categorically denied the accusations and released explanations. “Moroccans living abroad can still access [2M Monde channel] for free. It is always available on Hot Bird [satellite],” a spokesperson told the press. Some cable television operators in Europe decided to include 2M channel in a paid bundle plan, which made Moroccans living abroad think access to the channel was no longer free, added the spokesperson. دوزيم تفرض على الجالية المغربية 4,99 أورو شهريا كواجب للإشتراك مقابل الحصول على خدماتها.
أنا كمغربي، كنرفض نساهم ولو… Posted by MAROC INSOLITE !!! on Monday, 9 December 2019 الدوزيم تفرض رسوم الاشتراك على الجالية المغربية ههههههههههه
دبا زعمة نشترك معكم ونخلص في شهر هههههههه
تهنينا من الحموضة احسن حجة وقعت في 2019 Posted by Taza zoom on Sunday, 8 December 2019 What reinforced the rumors was the interruption of 2M’s broadcast on Nilesat satellite for around 90 minutes. The Moroccan channel explained the interruption came about because of a delayed payment from 2M to the company managing the satellite because of 2M’s financial crisis. The channel’s spokesperson explained that the broadcast interruption did not happen on any other satellite and that the channel maintains its free access on all available satellites. Another rumor emanating from 2M’s difficult financial situation was the addition of a fee in Moroccan electricity bills to support the channel. Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani denied the rumor, saying that the fee does not apply to 80% of Moroccans, and the money does not go to the television channel. The reason behind the financial crisis of 2M is the decline of advertisement revenue in recent years, which represents 90% of the channel’s income, explained an employee. As part of its cutbacks, 2M has closed its Tangier office and had some of its radio station material seized after it failed to pay rent.

Rabat – The leadership of the Moroccan football club Difaa Hassani d’El Jadida (DHJ) announced in a Facebook post the departure of its renowned coach Badou Zaki on Monday, December 23, to join the national Moroccan football team. DHJ canceled the contract by mutual consent at the request of Zaki, responding to a request from the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) to hire on the coach in service to the entire country.  Zaki will work with the Atlas Lions manager Vahid Halilhodzic who took over from Herve Renard after his resignation in July 2019. Zaki, who coached Morocco’s national football team from 2002 to 2005 and from 2014 to 2016, will join the technical staff of the FRMF. His position within the directorate is not yet known. The 60-year-old coach leaves DHJ ranked fifth of all Moroccan teams in the Moroccan Botola Pro league.

Rabat – International rugby star Sonny Bill Williams has joined the list of celebrities who are publicly denouncing China for its detentions of Uighur Muslims. Bill Williams, a New Zealander, used Twitter to condemn the human rights violations against Muslims on December 22. “It’s a sad time when we choose economic benefits over humanity #Uyghurs,” wrote the rugby player on his Twitter, using sad emojis to express his sympathy. China is facing widespread backlash over its treatment of Muslim Uighurs. The detentions again came to world headlines and public attention after international football player Mesut Ozil strongly condemned China for its actions and Muslims for their silence on the crisis. “Islamic theological schools, madrasas [Islamic schools] were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one” in China, he said. It’s a sad time when we choose economic benefits over humanity#Uyghurs 😢❤️🤲🏽 pic.twitter.com/F5EIWIOY7n — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) December 22, 2019  The UN estimates that 1 million Uighur Muslims are in detention in China. In addition to Ozil and Bill Williams, a recent summit in Malaysia put the issue of the Uighur Muslims on central stage. During the summit, influential preacher Mohd Asri bin Zainul Abidin called on Muslims to boycott Chinese products. “They know the strength of our purchasing power,” he said, emphasizing that the move should “be taken at the highest level of Muslim countries,” he told Al Jazeera. Hundreds of activists also marched in Turkey, where Ozil’s parents are from, and Hong Kong to express solidarity with the Uighur Muslims last week. On December 20, protesters demonstrated in Istanbul to condemn China’s violations. Police also broke up a rally in solidarity with the Uighurs in Hong Kong on December 22.

Rabat – A Moroccan teenager faced the children’s judge in the court of Creteil on Friday, December 20, for an attempt to steal an airplane. This summer, police at France’s Paris-Orly Airport arrested the 16-year-old, who had taken LSD, a hallucinogenic drug, before attempting to steal the plane.  The 16-year-old is an irregular migrant from Morocco who arrived in France two years ago, according to aviation news outlet Airlive.  The teen had been homeless for months leading up to his crime. The flight was reportedly headed for Morocco, and sources claim that the teenager simply wanted to return to his home country.  Airlive reported that Vueling Airlines employees discovered the Moroccan teenager in the cockpit of an Airbus A321. A maintenance technician reported that the boy had been tampering with the aircraft’s controls.  The Moroccan teenager reportedly resisted arrest, likely an effect of the LSD.  Paris-Orly Airport employees do not know how he managed to get on the plane or access the cockpit without authorization.  “His idea was to fly, not to fly himself,” his lawyer Marie Dieudonne de Carfort claimed. “He’s suspected of an impossible theft.” She added that one cannot steal an aircraft without any knowledge of how it operates.  “It’s a bit like trying to steal a house,” she said.  The arrest occurred in June 2019. French daily Le Parisien reported that the detainee’s mental state has been on the decline since his arrest.  “He stays naked in his cell” and uses only a blanket to cover himself, Le Parisien quotes the teen’s lawyer as saying.  “[He] goes to the toilet on the floor and paints the walls of the cell with his own feces.” During the trial on Friday, De Carfot maintained that her client faces danger in prison due to his mental health.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has shared its annual crime statistics before the end of the year, revealing security achievements, the criminal rate, drug arrest statistics, and control of irregular migration in Morocco. Police handled 639,116 criminal cases in 2019 and arrested 644,025 people, including 43,008 women and 23,746 minors. The DGSN said that it noticed a “relative stability in the percentage of [resolved] criminal cases of around 90.4%,” a result of “the systematic pillars of scientific and technical police.” The general directorate announced its particular focus on finding wanted people and its success in arresting 130,680 wanted people. Police arrested approximately 12% more people in 2019 than 2018, arrested 5% more minors, and heard 3% more complaints from victims of crimes. Violent crimes, such as serious robberies and sexual assaults, represent 8% of the general crime rate. Violent crimes saw a significant decrease of 8.6% compared to last year. Fatal assault decreased by 11.2%, indecent assault by 10.2%, theft by 3.4%, armed robbery by 21%, and vehicle theft by 7.8%, DGSN noted. 26% arrested irregular migrants are Moroccan Morocco has been increasing its efforts to combat criminal networks, including those involved in irregular migration and forgery. Police arrested this year 990 individuals suspected of being linked to 509 criminal theft networks on public highways. They also arrested 505 organizers of undocumented migration involved in 62 criminal networks that traffick people. Operations against irregular migration resulted in the arrest of 27,317 would-be migrants, including 20,141 of foreign nationality. Moroccans represented 26% of those arrested trying to migrate without documents. The DGSN also seized 3,021 false travel and ID documents. Morocco seized nearly 180,000 tons of cannabis The DGSN arrested 38% more people for drug-related offenses in 2019 than in 2018, with 12,049 cases. Operations led by both DGSN and other security units, such as the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), enabled the police to seize 179,657 tons of cannabis and its derivatives. The number represents an increase of 127 tons compared to the previous year. Police also seized harder drugs, including 542,455 kilograms of cocaine, 7,196 kilograms of heroin, and 1,407,451 psychotropic tablets, including 974,983 ecstasy tablets imported from Europe. 79 arrested for extremism, terrorism The national police also help in investigations and arrests of terror-related criminals. Judicial police referred 79 people suspected of being involved in terrorism and extremism to the courts.  Police also arrested 908 people involved in cybercrimes and 353 in extortion cases. Police also arrested 168 in cases of corruption and abuse of power, 234 people in cases of embezzlement and waste of public funds, 96 people in cases of counterfeiting of the national currency, and 59 individuals involved in fraud and counterfeiting of payment cards—including 38 Moroccan citizens and 21 of European and sub-Saharan African nationalities.

 Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has denied that a new royalty fee was added to electricity bills to save television channel 2M from bankruptcy. Rumors surrounding the fee appeared recently on social media after many internet users noticed a fee for “supporting the audiovisual” media. El Othmani made his statement on Sunday, December 22, during a meeting of Justice and Development Party (PJD) members from the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region. The meeting took place at the party’s headquarters in Rabat. The head of government said the rumors are “lies.” The fee in question is “old,” existing since 1996, and “80% of Moroccans” do not have to pay it. دعم الإعلام السمعي البصري ضمن فواتير الكهرباء موجود منذ سنة 1996 وليس جديدا وعلى عكس مايروجه البعض فإن 80 ٪ من الأسر المغربية معفية منه منذ سنوات، ولا توجد أي نية أو نقاش داخل الحكومة لفرض أي رسم جديد .
ولايؤدي رسم 55 درهم إلا من يدخلون الشطر الرابع والخامس في استهلاك الكهرباء. — رئيس الحكومة -المغرب (@ChefGov_ma) December 22, 2019 
People in the poorest three scales of the government’s sliding scale electricity bill structure have not had to pay the fee to support audio-visual media since 2013 when the government exempted them, said El Othmani. The fee “does not concern 80% of Moroccan families who live in precarity or the middle class. It only [applies to] subscribers who reached the fourth and fifth [sections of the sliding scale]. For them, supporting national audiovisual [companies] with 55 dirhams is nothing,” he continued. El Othmani also explained that “2M does not benefit from this fee.” In a publicized video of the speech, El Othmani made no mention of what the fee actually supports.  At the end of his speech, El Othmani deplored that “some members” of the PJD “contributed to the spreading of the ‘fake news.’” Earlier this month, many Moroccans shared photos of their electricity bills on social media, highlighting the “new” royalty fee. The users accused the government of implementing the fee to support 2M and save it from bankruptcy. مكس إنعاش قطاع السمعي البصري هو في الحقيقة لانقاذ القناة الثانية 2M من الاغلاق باستنزاف جيوب المواطنين حيث يوجد على ذمة… Posted by Fathallah Souiri on Tuesday, 10 December 2019 بعد حملات الشرسة التي اتفق عليها المواطنين المغاربة عامة بحذف هذه القناة الفاسدة ، و مقاطعة مشاهدة برامجها ، مؤخرا رأينا… Posted by ‎مول كاكول Moul kagoul‎ on Sunday, 8 December 2019 Rumors about the reason behind the fee began after 2M’s difficult financial situation became public. The channel closed its Tangier office for non-payment of rent and had some of their radio station material seized. Advertisement revenue, which represents 90% of the channel’s income, has been in a steep decline in recent years, an employee at 2M told news outlet Le360.

Rabat – Police in Casablanca arrested several fans of Casablanca’s Raja Athletic Club (RCA) and Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) for their involvement in acts of hooliganism that erupted after the derby between the two clubs at the Mohammed V Stadium on Sunday, December 23. Violence after the game resulted in injury to two members of the security services and damage to both security vehicles and privately owned cars. “After the game between Raja and Wydad of Casablanca … so-called supporters of the two clubs clashed and resorted to stone-throwing near the stadium and at some [major roads] of the Hay-Hassani area,” said local authorities of the Casablanca-Settat region, according to a report by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Clashes between the two clubs’ fans erupted after Wydad lost the game to Raja 1-0. Although the police deployed many officers around the stadium to prevent fights and block rowdy fans from running into the surrounding neighborhoods, violent fans of both clubs managed to cross the authorities’ blockade by passing through alleys. All the way to the Maarif neighborhood, the closest to the stadium, fans were seen exchanging blows and threats, while residents hurried to protect their vehicles and properties. Police eventually restored order and arrested some of the violent fans, although others managed to escape. The police are questioning the arrested fans and investigating their alleged involvement in acts of hooliganism.

Rabat – Abdelmadjid Tebboune, president of Algeria, has announced that the current head of land forces, General Said Chengriha, will now be the acting chief of the Algerian armed forces. Tebboune announced the replacement hours after the death of army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah from a heart attack on Monday, December 23. Chengriha, 74, served as the head of land forces, a post that Gaid Salah held before his appointment as the chief of the Algerian army. With Chengriha’s appointment, Tebboune seeks to preserve Algeria’s positions, promoting people who are loyal to the Algerian agenda on certain regional and internal issues, including Western Sahara. Chengriha has made statements indicating he considers Morocco an enemy of Algeria. In 2016, a recording of Chengriha declaring support for Polisario went viral on social media. “I recall that Algeria is always loyal to its principles to condemn injustice, tyranny, and all sorts of colonizations,” he said.  He added that Algeria “strives to establish security in the region and support the brotherly Sahrawi people and their right to establish their state and live in pride and dignity.” Moroccans interpreted the statements as against Morocco’s territorial integrity because Morocco considers its sovereignty over the southern provinces in Western Sahara a red line. A signal of more tension with Rabat Tebboune’s appointment of Chengriha, less than two weeks into his presidency, is one of his first to indicate that there will be no reconciliation between Rabat and Algiers. Tebboune won the presidential election with the full support of the army during his presidential campaign. He also played the Western Sahara conflict as a card to win votes, announcing his support for the Algerian position. During press conferences, Tebboune also called on Morocco to apologize for accusing Algeria of involvement in the Asni terror attack in Marrakech back in 1994. Algeria then closed its border with Morocco after Morocco changed its visa policy on Algerian citizens following the attack. “Algeria did not close the border due to Western Sahara,” Tebboune said during his presidential campaign. “The border might be open again someday. But apologize,” he demanded. He claimed that at the time of the border closure, Morocco stranded “at least 350 Algerians.” Morocco has denied the allegations. Several reports said that Algeria expelled 45,000 Moroccan families after the Green March in 1975. Some of the families opened up about their experience in the 19th session of the UN Human Rights Council in 2012 in Geneva. Appointments in line with Algeria’s agenda Algeria publicly supports the breakaway movement of the Polisario Front and its project for independence in Western Sahara. The appointment of Chengriha shows that there is little chance of Algeria accepting Morocco’s offer to engage in a frank and serious dialogue to break the political stalemate between the countries. The initiative first came from King Mohammed VI first in November 2018, and several Moroccan officials repeated the offer, attempting to convince Algeria to engage in the dialogue process. Algeria, however, did not respond to the call for dialogue, with several officials calling Morocco an “enemy.”

Rabat – Saudi public prosecutor Shaalan al Shaalan has announced the sentencing of five people to death for their involvement in the murder of the prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. A statement from the prosecutor said that the five men “who directly took part in the killing.” Al Jazeera reported that prosecutors found the deputy intelligence chief, Ahmed al Assiri, guilty of overseeing the killing of the journalist in Istanbul.  Saud al-Qahtani, a former royal adviser, had reportedly “advised” the deputy intelligence chief, but Saudi Arabia says there was not enough evidence to convict him. Al Assiri “was charged but eventually acquitted on the same grounds,” Al Jazeera added. The Saudi consul general in Istanbul was also acquitted and released. Saudi Arabia arrested 11 other unnamed people for involvement in the killing. Out of the 11, the court sentenced three to prison sentences totalling 24 years. The three other suspects were “acquitted,” Al Jazeera commented. The trial was held secretly, with only some diplomats from Saudi Arabia and Turkey attending. Saudi Arabia also allowed members of Khashoggi’s family to attend the trial. The Khashoggi murder shocked the world last year, and international intelligence agencies pointed at Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the instigator. Rights groups have long condemned Saudi oppression of activists speaking out in opposition to its policies. Human Rights Watch issued a report in 2019 slamming Saudi Arabia for its continued oppression of activists, clerics, and women. HRW found that Saudi Arabia arrested approximately 70 people in September 2017. The report also commented on the Khashoggi case. “Around April 4, 2019, despite continuing international criticism stemming from the Khashoggi murder, Saudi Arabia carried out a new round of arrests, this time targeting 13 writers and activists,” HRW wrote. The NGO also asked Saudi Arabia to publicize information about the trial. Saudi Arabia’s royal family has distanced itself from the Khashoggi murder. Surprisingly, bin Salman claimed responsibility for the killing, saying that the execution operation happened under his watch. “It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch,” MBS told PBS’ Martin Smith for a documentary. Bin Salman, however, denied having prior knowledge of the plot. In October, reports quoted alleged recordings of the perpetrators of the murder. The conversation documents a talk between Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb and Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, two people allegedly involved in the killing of Khashoggi. During the conversation, Mutreb asked Al Tubaigy if a bag would fit the body. “No. Too heavy, very tall too,” Al Tubaigy answered. He added, “I’ve always worked on cadavers. I know how to cut very well. I have never worked on a warm body though, but I’ll also manage that easily. I normally put on my earphones and listen to music when I cut cadavers.”

Kaanache explained to Ramsay the history of the Amazigh (Berber) people, their land, and their dishes.  The experience then took Ramsay to an Amazigh village during their Yennayer (new year) celebration.  Ramsay was admittedly moved by his experience in Morocco.  “I’ve been humbled by these people’s incredible hospitality. I’ve learned techniques that go back centuries, and been reminded that you don’t need a fancy kitchen to produce truly outstanding cuisine,” he said at the end of the episode.

Rabat – The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) has signed a partnership agreement with the digital platform “Morocco-Alumni,” to bring foreign students and graduates together in an interactive space as a networking opportunity in Morocco. The president of MASEN, Mustapha Bakkoury, and the ambassador director-general of the Moroccan Agency of International Cooperation (AMCI), Mohamed Methqal, signed the agreement at the eighth African Students and Youth Summit on Sunday, December 22, in Rabat. Developed by MASEN in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the digital platform “Morocco-Alumni.ma” aims to improve student networking among the 14,000 foreign students currently enrolled in Moroccan universities, including 12,000 from 47 African countries, and 35,000 foreign graduates. Developers hope the platform will accelerate the careers of all graduates by connecting them with companies and partners for better integration into the job market, facilitating communication with foreign students in the kingdom, and contributing to their skills by providing rich and useful digital content. Enhancing communication with foreign students would meet an apparent need. A Ghanaian student in Morocco named Emmanuel told Morocco World News last month that there are challenges with communication to foreign students. “There’s no transparency,” he said. “Only some people get the information and a foreign student might miss that information because [the professor] may distribute the information in Arabic or maybe may not even distribute it.” Emmanuel explained that foreign students, especially Anglophones, can face additional challenges with the language of instruction. While courses in Morocco are mainly taught in French, some professors switch to Arabic during their lectures, leaving Anglophones and Francophones at a loss. In a press statement, Bakkoury stressed the importance of the platform in the institutionalization of the Moroccan-African partnership in the framework of South-South cooperation. Meanwhile, Methqal said that the agreement will allow foreign students graduating from Moroccan universities to use the interactive space and skilled Moroccans residing abroad can also communicate with different partners through the platform. Methqal added that through the platform, foreign students and graduates can get training and seek employment opportunities in Morocco, the rest of Africa, and the world. The Morocco-Alumni platform will soon be open to foreign students and graduates of private higher education institutes in Morocco, as well as to all skilled Moroccans residing abroad and to all actors wishing to actively participate in the development of Africa. Meeting under the theme “The future of Africa: Challenges and prospects for young people,” from December 20 to 23 by the All Africa Students Union and the AMCI, the eighth African Students and Youth Summit brought together more than 1,000 participants, including students, heads of African student associations, university graduates, executives and senior officials, including several ministers and ambassadors from 52 African countries.

Rabat – Beginning in 2021, the EU Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to pay a fee to receive an ETIAS travel authorization before they can enter Europe’s Schengen Area.  Nationals of 62 countries and territories can currently travel to most European countries visa-free, while travelers from 104 countries and entities need to obtain a visa to enter Schengen countries for up to three months.  The new ETIAS visa waiver will only apply to citizens of countries such as the US, Australia, and Canada who currently do not need a visa to access the Schengen Area.  While the regulations will impose new restrictions on currently visa-exempt travelers, the application process can be completed in minutes and will likely have lower fees than those associated with the Schengen visa.  Moroccans and nationals from the other 104 countries, including most countries throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, will still need to apply for Schengen visas.  What is ETIAS? ETIAS refers to an electronic system that keeps track of visitors from visa-exempt countries. Similar to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ETSA) that determines the eligibility of visitors to travel to the US, ETIAS aims to strengthen border control and security around the Schengen Area.  More than 30 million non-Europeans travel to the Schengen Area visa-free every year.  ETIAS will soon require nationals from 60 countries to obtain authorization to travel to the Schengen Area. Citizens of the US, Australia, Canada, Israel, and the UAE are among those who will be impacted by the new travel regulations.   The list of ETIAS eligible countries is subject to change. Beginning in 2021, eligible nationals planning to visit the Schengen Area must submit an online ETIAS visa waiver application to receive travel authorization for business or touristic purposes.  The ETIAS application fees have the potential to bring over €500 million to the European authorities annually.  The ETIAS visa is not a substitute for a student or working visa. Those looking to live, study, work, or reside in Europe longer than 90 days need a different type of visa. How is ETIAS authorization different from the Schengen visa? The Schengen and ETIAS visas are short-stay permits that allow holders to travel to the 26 European countries known as Schengen states for up to three months. Because the ETIAS countries and the Schengen countries are the same, an ETIAS visa is effectively a Schengen visa.  The difference lies in the application process, fees, validity periods, and who is eligible for which visa.  ETIAS applicants will only need a valid passport, credit card, and travel plans. An estimated 95% of applicants will receive travel authorization within minutes of applying online. Schengen applicants currently need to submit their applications in person at the appropriate embassy, consulate, or visa center; however, online applications will become more widespread in 2020.   To apply for a Schengen visa, travelers need to present their application form, two recent photos, a valid passport, travel plans, travel insurance, proof of accommodation, proof of financial means, and proof of a paid visa fee. Some Schengen country embassies may require further documentation.  While Schengen visas expire after three months, the ETIAS validity period is three years. The ETIAS allows holders to take several trips to the Schengen Zone within three years.    Nationals who need Schengen visas to travel to Europe, including all African countries and most countries in the Middle East and Asia, will not benefit from ETIAS.  What is the Schengen Area? The Schengen Area is not synonymous with the EU. The EU is a political and economic union consisting of 28 member states. The Schengen Area refers to 26 European countries, 22 of which are EU members, that have officially abolished all border control at their mutual borders to allow for unrestricted travel across Europe. Ireland and the UK are currently members of the EU, but they are not Schengen states.  Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania are members of the EU, but they have not yet joined the Schengen Area. They are legally obliged to join the agreement in the future.  Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland are not in the EU, but they are Schengen members.  The micro-states of Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City are included in the Schengen Area.  What does this mean for Morocco? Citizens of countries like Morocco who need to apply for a Schengen visa to visit Europe will not be eligible for the ETIAS visa waiver. Moroccans hoping to travel to Europe should apply for a Schengen visa as usual.  In 2020, the new Schengen visa code will raise application fees, extend the period for submitting applications, and offer electronic application options in most countries.  Schengen visa applicants will need to pay a fee of €80 (MAD 855) per application rather than the current rate of €60 (MAD 641). Applications for children aged 7 and older will cost €40 (MAD 427) rather than €35 (MAD 374). Children 6 years old and younger will remain exempt from fees.  The Schengen visa is one of the world’s most sought-after visas. The consulates of the 26 Schengen member states received more than 16 million applications in 2018.  Moroccans spent more than than $44 million (MAD 424 million) on 662,586 Schengen visa applications in 2018.

Rabat – The powerful army chief of Algeria General Ahmed Gaid Salah has died today, December 23 at the age of 79. Reports said that Salah suffered a heart attack Monday morning, December 23. He was rushed to a hospital in Algiers, where he died. The death of Salah comes as a shock in the political arena as he has been the de facto leader of Algeria during the continuous protests that began in February 2019. Gaid Salah was born in 1940 in Batana, Algeria. The army chief has served in the Algerian military since 1958. He became the head of staff of Algeria’s People National Army in 2004. The former head of Algeria’s army also began serving as the vice minister of defence in 2013. Gaid Salah played a major role in the protests in Algeria that began when former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his decision to run for a fifth term in the presidential election. With the country’s leadership under pressure, Salah urged Bouteflika to resign. When Bouteflika resigned in April, Salah led the country until the appointment of an interim government. Despite the appointment of an interim president, Gaid Salah was still seen as the main leader in the country, calling on protesters to end demonstrations. Salah also led a purge of senior government officials in an effort to appease protesters after the resignation of Bouteflika. He ordered the arrest of dozens of military officials and former senior government officials, such as Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal.  Both served as prime ministers. An Algerian court sentenced Ouyahia to 15 years and Sellal to 12 years on December 10. Rise to power Gaid Salah took part in military training at Vystrel Military Academy near Moscow, Russia, after Algeria’s independence. The government promoted Salah to general in 1990 and then to major-general in 1993. Algeria entrusted him with the command of the land forces in 1994. Bouteflika insisted on keeping Salah in his government in 2004 when he replaced former chief of staff Mohamed Lamari. The former Algerian president forced Lamari to leave because Lamari opposed Bouteflika running for a second term. Since then, Gaid Salah became the right-hand man and a loyal supporter of Bouteflika’s regime. Gaid Salah gained more visibility in 2013 after Bouteflika had a stroke. When Bouteflika returned to Algiers after more than 80 days recovering in Paris, he appointed Salah as deputy defence minister. Former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s absence from the public after his stroke led to Salah’s increasing power among political leaders in the country. Gaid Salah backed each of Bouteflika’s decisions to run for president for his four terms. He also backed Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term until the escalation of protests, which led Salah to ask for Bouteflika’s resignation. It was Salah’s idea to push for a presidential election in December 12, resulting in the voting in of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune who took to his presidential office in Al Mouradia, the presidential the presidential residence, despite the continuous protests.

Rabat  – Morocco’s heavyweight kickboxing champion Badr Hari expressed his pride at how much support he received from his fans across the world after his injury in the glory rematch with Rico Verhoeven on December 21. On his Instagram, the champion said he thanks “all of my army for this incredible fight night.” “You were amazing and I can’t describe what I felt entering the ring in this crazy atmosphere. It was unique and I’m so proud to have your support behind me,” Hari told his fans. Hari was in tears after he had to abandon the fight against Dutch Rico Verhoeven when he sustained an ankle injury in the third round. Hari had been preparing for the fight for three years, vowing to beat Rico in a rematch after he lost his first fight against the Dutch champion due to an injury in 2016. “You can imagine how it is difficult for me to accept this outcome,” the Moroccan heavyweight said.  Hari, however, expressed satisfaction with his performance during Saturday’s glory match. “I have shown the world that I’m still the most dominant fighter of the heavyweight division.” He vowed that he is still “fully convinced that I will conquer this belt.” Hari concluded his message, thanking Rico for “his exemplary sportsmanship after my injury. I will be back. Be prepared.”
 Following the fight, Rico wrote a supportive message to Rico, thanking him for the “amazing fight.” “I never got this close to losing a fight like this. Getting knocked down twice. OMG. so disappointed in myself and at the same time taking my hat off to @badrhariofficial for giving me and the fans what we’ve been waiting for.” He also invited Hari to a rematch. “I hope you get well soon. We’ll meet again,” Rico said.     I want to thank all my army for this incredible fight night. You were amazing and I can’t describe what I felt entering the ring in this crazy atmosphere. It was unique and I’m so proud to have your support behind me. You can imagine how it is difficult for me to accept this outcome. I have shown the world that I’m still the most dominant fighter of the heavyweight division. I’m also fully convinced that I will conquer this belt. I would also like to thank @ricoverhoeven for his exemplary sportsmanship after my injury. I will be back. Be prepared. #BadrArmy A post shared by  Badr Hari (@badrhariofficial) on Dec 22, 2019 at 6:14am PST

Rabat – Omar El Hyani, city councilor and elected official of Morocco’s Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party, issued a statement on behalf of his party warning the public of toxic waste near Rabat.  “An ecological disaster is about to happen in Rabat,” El Hyani stated in a Facebook post on Friday, December 20. “Thousands of tons of garbage leachate from the Oum Azza landfill could be spilled by truck into the sea.” Leachate is the liquid that drains or ‘leaches’ from a landfill, containing both dissolved and suspended material. ‘Leaching’ occurs when water percolates through permeable solids.  Generating leachate is a major problem for municipal solid waste landfills because it contaminates surface water and groundwater, posing a threat to humans and causing pollution.  “These highly toxic leachates have accumulated for years in pools near the landfill and [create] strong ecological and olfactory pollution for the whole city,” El Hyani’s statement continued.  He went on the explain that Al Assima, the municipal group that manages Rabat’s Oum Azza landfill, is preparing to dump thousands of tons of leachate into the Atlantic Ocean. This could trigger an ecological disaster and decimate marine life, El Hyani claimed.  The FGD is demanding that the operation be terminated immediately.  “We cannot remain silent or complicit in the face of an ecological disaster,” the official concluded.

Rabat – Thousands of people marched in Turkey and Hong Kong to voice solidarity with Uighur Muslims against the strict policies they suffer from in China. On Friday, December 20, thousands of protesters flocked to Istanbul with banners, condemning China for it violations of the rights of minority Uighur Muslims. In Hong Kong, people also attempted to rally in solidarity with Uighurs on Sunday, December 22, before China’s riot police dispersed the solidarity protests. AFP said that the peaceful protests turned into “chaos” when a mall group of demonstrators removed the Chinese flag from a building and tried to burn it. The organizers of the protests stopped the group group from burning the flag, but riot police swept the area with “pepper spray.” AFP said that one policeman pointed out a pistol into the crowd. The riot did not fire, however. France 24 said that police detained numerous protesters during the protests. The protests against China comes a few weeks after international football player Mesut Ozil slammed China for its discriminatory policies against Uighur Muslims. “Islamic theological schools, madrasas [Islamic schools] were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one” in China. Ozil also  condemned Muslims’ silence over the situation of their fellows in China. Since then, China has faced even more backlash from public figures and internet users on social media, despite its denial. Boycott of Chinese products Mohd Asri bin Zainul Abidin, a  renowned Malaysian preacher joined the list of people who condemned China for Uighur Muslims. Hetold Al Jazeera on the sidelines of a summit of Muslim-majority countries in Kuala Lumpur that people should boycott China’s  product. “They know the strength of our purchasing power,” he said, emphasizing that the move should “be taken at the highest level of Muslim countries.” On social media, especially on Twitter, internet users across the world are using hashtag “boycott China’s products” in Arabic to condemn the country’s repressive policies against Uighurs. One Twitter user said: “ China is terrorist. Stop killing Muslims.” China is terrorist 🔪 STOP KILLING MUSLIMS💔💔💔 #قاطعوا_منتجات_الصين#الصين#الإيغور#China_kills_Muslims#中國殺死穆斯林#China_is_terrorist#مسلمي_الايغور_بتموت_يعرب #WeAreWithYouOzil pic.twitter.com/grflOWqHcn — Naj (@NajlaAbdul88) December 22, 2019  Commenting on Ozil’ statement, another Twitter user wrote: “some situations make you lose the love of others, but they earn your respect.” The user also used the same hashtag. The United Nations estimated the number of Uighurs detainees in Xinjiang at one million. In May, top US defence official in charge of Asia Randall Schriver said that the number “was likely closer to three million citizens,” according to Al Jazeera.

Rabat – Paraguay’s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Latin American country’s parliament, has adopted a resolution in support of Rabat’s position on the Western Sahara region in southern Morocco. In a declaration following the vote, the Paraguayan parliament insisted that Morocco’s autonomy plan, which has largely been described as serious and credible, is the only viable route to a lasting settlement in the Western Sahara territorial dispute. The move makes Paraguay part of a growing list of Latin American countries that are now voicing support for Morocco’s proposal at the expense of their hitherto inclination—pronounced or subtle—of the Polisario Front’s self-autonomy and decolonization rhetoric. “This new resolution, the third of its kind in less than two years, is a new achievement for Morocco’s national cause and a clear support for both the autonomy project and Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Moroccan state-owned newspaper MAP said of the Asuncion’s move. While MAP’s assessment exudes some bits of exaggeration, the evaluation holds and it boils down, at its most basic, to the readily recognizable sense of regained morale that has characterized Morocco’s Latin America diplomacy in the past six months. In June, Morocco’s FM, Nasser Bourita, embarks on a Latin American tour in what ostensibly an attempt to engineer a pro-Morocco momentum in a region whose historical affinity with Marxism-inspired “revolutionary” groups came with a certain preference for Polisario’s side of the Western Sahara story. The Moroccan FM’s tour bore fruits, with Brazil, Brazil, Surinam, Chile, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, officially voicing their support for Morocco’s “credible” and “pragmatic” Western Sahara stance in the immediate aftermath of Bourita’s visit. Some other countries from the region have since followed suit by either suspending their recognition of Polisario’s statehood claims or downright rejecting the front’s “rigid” and “unviable” insistence on self-autonomy and referendum. While the Paraguayan parliament’s move cannot be said to be a direct offspring of what some have termed Morocco’s Latin American “diplomatic remontada,” in reference to the encouraging developments that followed Bourita’s tour, it is hard to resist the suggestion that Asuncion’s newfound “commitment to Morocco’s territorial integrity” is at the very least an essential part of Latin America’s perceivably decisive drift towards Rabat. Apart from the usual praise of the “pragmatism,” “credibility,” and “political feasibility” of its Autonomy proposal, another feature of Rabat’s recent successes in Latin America appears to be the perception among many diplomats and observers that Morocco is serious and reliable in its increased promotion of South-South cooperation. Often unarticulated in most of the pro-Morocco declarations on Western Sahara is the idea that in addition to its perceived commitment to a lasting political settlement for Western Sahara, Morocco’s encouraging experiences in a wide-range of “common challenges” (transnational security, for example) have gradually made it an invaluable partner to have. “Regarding Morocco’s territorial integrity, Paraguay reiterates its unconditional support for Morocco’s position on this conflict and for all initiatives in support of the kingdom,” Paraguay FM, Luis Alberto Castiglioni, said recently. “We are very pleased that relations between Paraguay and Morocco are at their best and we are working to make them even better.”

Rabat – Spanish agriculture companies have selected 6,500 Moroccan women to participate in the red fruit harvest in Spain for the 2020 season. Spanish news outlet El Diario reported that hundreds of women flocked to a recruitment center in Morocco hoping to be part of the campaign. “Companies do not find enough people in Spain and come to find cheap labor in Morocco,” the news outlet said. The news outlet quoted some of the women who filed applications for a job opportunity in Spanish farms. “We hope to work in good conditions, we heard that Spaniards treat us well there,” one woman said. Spanish companies ask for women to have experience in the field. El Diario said that it is difficult for women to prove they have an experience in the agriculture sector. “These women do not have documentation that justifies any previous years of work in agriculture. When Spanish recruiters ask them, they show their hands instinctively. A single glance at the hands of Fatima brings anyone out of doubt,” the news outlet said. Age is another key requirement. Companies typically seek women aged between 25 and 45 years and with children that can take care of themselves while mothers are gone. Spanish companies make sure that women have  engagements that would urge them to leave Spain once the harvest is finished. More than 16,000 Moroccans will participate in the upcoming campaign, the Moroccan Ministry of Employment announced in November. The campaign’s organizers seek to hire 11,000 Moroccan experienced seasonal workers. The other 5,500 will be first-timers. Situation is not always good Despite women’s scramble for the openings, the situation in the farms is far from ideal, or as positive and rewarding as portrayed by organizers.  Several Moroccan women have recentyly filed lawsuits against Spanish farm managers, accusing them of sexual assault and ill treatment. Earlier this year, The New York Times quoted a pregnant Moroccan seasonal worker who said that her manager “sexually harassed” her when she arrived in Spain to work. She said that her manager “pressured her to have sex, promising her a better life and working conditions.” When she refused, the pregnant woman said that her manager forced her to work harder. Morocco has since set up a committee to deal with the recurring exploitation and sexual abuse complaints, vowing to prevent a repeat of previous scandals.

Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron declared that colonialism was “a mistake of the [French] Republic” on Saturday, December 21, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. Macron made the statement in a joint press conference with the Ivorian president Alassane Ouattara in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. “Today, France is usually perceived [as having] a look of hegemony and tinsels of colonialism, which was a profound error, a mistake of the [French] Republic,” said the French president. In his speech, Macron called for “building a new page” between France and its former African colonies. “I belong to a generation which is not that of colonization,” he added. “Sometimes, young people blame France for the troubles and difficulties they may have experienced and that France can do nothing about,” Macron continued. France is “sometimes the perfect target” to blame for several issues. Macron concluded with a note of  hope, saying that he would like to see that “this young Africa agrees to build a much more fruitful friendship partnership…. with a new France.” The French president is on an official visit to Cote d’Ivoire that started on Friday, December 20, and ends today, December 22, to discuss relations between the two countries and several issues shaping the region of West Africa.

Rabat – The sectors of education and training are “the first priorities” of the Moroccan government because they are essential levers for the country’s progress and development, said Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. El Othmani made the statement on Saturday, December 21, at the opening of a national conference on “the private sector and the framework law 51.17 relating to education, training, and scientific research,” in Agadir. During his speech, El Othmani recalled the 32% increase in the education budget between 2016 and 2020. The head of government also called upon all concerned actors, including the ministry, local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to make efforts to develop the education and training sectors. The private sector is an essential partner of the state in the promotion of education, El Othmani stated. It is responsible for ensuring that the criteria of quality and equity are respected and implemented, he added. According to the official, the Moroccan government is responsible for accompanying and supporting the private sector in accomplishing its mission under the best conditions. El Othmani highlighted the importance of adopting the framework law 51.17 on education, training, and scientific research. The framework law 51.17 aims to fix some of the inconsistencies that the Moroccan education system suffers from. However, article 31 of the law, calling for the use of foreign languages in teaching scientific and technical subjects in middle and high schools, has sparked a lot of controversy. Despite the Moroccan government “prioritizing” the education sector, the sector has been facing major challenges in the last decades. Most recently, after the Ministry of Education decided to start hiring teachers under annually renewable contracts in 2016, Moroccan teachers went on regular strikes and threatened to not go back to their classrooms. The teachers’ demands include improving infrastructures, ending the “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers, and facilitating promotions.

Rabat – A raging bull ravaged the streets of Rabat, damaging cars and motorcycles and ramming a woman on Friday, December 20. The bull escaped from a slaughterhouse in the neighborhood of Akkari before running near the coastline for several kilometers, scaring drivers and pedestrians alike. The animal disrupted traffic on the busy corniche of Rabat. The raging beast rammed its victim near the Udayas of Rabat, leaving her unconscious on the ground. People at the scene carried the fainted woman and transported her to the other side of the street. Emergency services arrived and took the woman to the hospital. The animal kept running even further until it reached the ocean and got surrounded by a dozen pedestrians. Locals finally put an end to the bull’s rampage after putting a net on its head and roping its legs. Local authorities arrived at the scene after the citizens put the animal under control and transported it back to the slaughterhouse on a towing truck. Many videos on the internet documented the wild escapee during its frenzy.

Rabat – Moroccan project “Kit Biotech” has won the 2019 Maghreb Francophone Incubator (IFM) competition for startups. The award ceremony took place on Friday, December 20, in Rabat. The contest, organized by the Francophone University Agency (AUF) in the Maghreb and the Moroccan Center for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship (MCISE), brought together 12 students from Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The students presented their startup projects in front of an expert jury. MCISE mentors accompanied the students for two months to help them bring their projects to life. Three Moroccan projects finished in the first three positions of the competition. Sara Maghzaz won the competition with her “Kit Biotech” project, followed by Naoual Ibn El Fadil with her “Jnane Amir” project, and Aymen Hilali for his “Wood Recycling Lab.” The competitors took part in several workshops to improve their technical skills, ranging from elaborating a business model to validating an action plan for their startups. Following every workshop, the students had to present their project’s progress in front of a jury before moving on to the next session. AUF’s regional director in the Maghreb, Jean-Luc Tholozan, told the press that the competition aims to develop and support entrepreneurship. The agency selected the most promising startup projects in the region and hosted the students behind them for two months to help develop their ideas. The agency will finance and support the winning students until they bring their projects to life, Tholozan added. The director explained that the term incubator in the contest’s name refers to a place that offers administrative, technical, and socio-economic advice, allowing project-holders to concretize their ideas. AUF is an association of universities, research centers, and higher schools that use French as the main language. The agency counts 990 members from 118 different countries, according to AUF’s vice-rector Clement Ramiarinjaona. AUF’s Maghreb office opened in Rabat in 2012. It ensures the coordination of AUF’s action between 118 members from Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria.

Rabat – Moroccan police have arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in an international drug trafficking network in Oujda, eastern Morocco. The security services carried out the operation on Saturday, December 21, near the beach of Saidia in Oujda. The five suspects, aged between 26 and 41, were in possession of 555 kilograms of cannabis resin, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Police arrested the suspects in three separate cars. The suspects had concealed the cannabis in 17 separate packages. Police also seized 1,450 liters of gasoline, nine mobile phones, a GPS device, and an unspecified amount of money allegedly acquired from drug trafficking. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation. Police are still looking to arrest any possible accomplices involved in the case. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat drug trafficking networks across the country. Throughout the year, Morocco’s DGSN carried out several similar operations, which led to the arrest of dozens of suspects involved in drug trafficking. One of the latest operations took place on December 14, when police seized 650 kilograms of cannabis resin in Agadir. In the nine first months of 2019, the DGSN seized more than 112 tons of cannabis and its derivatives. Police also arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15.

Rabat – The long-awaited face-off, marketed as the biggest fight in the history of kickboxing, strangely ended in a similar fashion to the first clash between two of the biggest names in the history of the sport. In 2016 the Moroccan fighter had to pull off from the fight in the secondround due to an arm injury. This time it was an injury in the left leg during the third round that put an end to quite an impressive performance by Hari. The result was quite disappointing to many of Badr Hari’s fans, especially in regard to the build-up to that rematch. It was funny to see some conspiracy theories floating around, with some YouTube users swearing that the fight was scripted, and that Hari faked his injury to avoid going to the fourthor fifth rounds because he knew he was going to lose. Those bold statements were advanced despite the fact that a clearly out-of-shape Hari knocked down the younger and more athletic current Glory champion twice, something which most heavyweight fighters in the promotion have failed to do despite being more active than Hari, who has been fighting only now and then. Apparently those super-zealous ‘’fans’’ feel that Hari let them down. For them, Hari can only be celebrated as a Moroccan pride if he keeps winning. But to lose, even if it was due to an injury, makes you unworthy of all the praise that was heaved upon you before. While Hari clearly has nothing to prove, as he is recognized worldwide as one of the most popular kickboxers to ever compete, a number of Moroccan fans only learned about him when his kickboxing career took a down-spiral.  Some of them seem to have little appreciation for a champion who, whether we liked it or not, was the top athlete to represent Morocco in combat sports on a high level before other names took center stage like Ilias Bulaid and Jamal Ben Seddik in kickboxing, the Azaitar brothers (Abu and Ottman) in MMA, and Mohamed Rabii in boxing.  Great, but could have been greater There is no doubt that Badr Hari is a living kickboxing legend. The Moroccan fighter is one of the biggest names in the history of the sport. His popularity did not wane despite the fact that his glorious years are gone. At quite a young age Hari was making a name for himself in K-1, the Japanese organization that helped popularize kickboxing. By 2007, then in his early twenties, Hari became the next rising star within the promotion while competing along with older and more experienced fighters such as Peter Aerts, Ray Sefo, and Semmy Schilt. His wins over the three aforementioned fighters, all legends of the sport, cemented his legacy as one of the most vicious contenders in the heavyweight division. His short-tempered character, along with his aggressive fighting still, high knock-out ratio, and the bad-boy image that stuck to him for years all helped boost his career and popularity. While many people liked him, for others he was a bad representative of the sport—especially with incidents when he punched and kicked his opponents, Remy Bonjasky and Hesdy Gerges, while they were on the floor. One thing was sure though:love him or hate him, as a kickboxing fan, you could not be indifferent to someone like Badr Hari.  In the span of seven years he had won K-1 and ‘It’s Showtime’ heavyweight titles, reached the final of the K-1 Grand Prix two years in a row (2008-2009), scored some of the most memorable knockouts in the history of kickboxing, and defeated big names such as Alistair Overeem and Gokhan Saki. While his long ride was set to continue, his career would suffer due to his behavior outside the ring, with him being charged of incidents of physical assault which led to his arrest and detention.  From 2012 onward, we would only see a pale version of the old Badr Hari. He turned into a fighter who lost his long-known knock-out power, lost the rage for winning, was mostly after money-fights, and scored wins against fighters who were way past their prime while avoiding more serious challenges from more fit fighters. His time fighting for the Russian promotion Legend and the Dubai-based GFC had nothing to resemble his more shining K-1 days. Time to hang the gloves Strangely enough, Hari was relatively unknown in Morocco when he was already a big name in Asia and Europe. It was only when he started to appear more on Moroccan media and settled down in the kingdom that the base of his local fans seemed to grow.  These fans cheered for Hari even as he unconvincingly won GFC’s tournament in 2014, beating his former K-1 opponents, Stefan Leko and Peter Graham, two fighters who were way past their prime. His performance against Ismael Londt in 2015 under the banner of Akhmat Fighting Championship in Chechnya was his best since he knocked Gokhan Saki out in 2012. But, despite the win against a strong opponent, Hari proved once again that he is not the same fighter he used to be. He gassed out during the fight. And while he knocked his opponent four times during the bout, it was clearly he was no more the same knock-out artist from the K-1 days. Still, hiring Badr Hari was the perfect move for Glory. The Moroccan fighter was still a big name worldwide and a potential match-up against the organization’s undisputed champion, Rico Verhoeven, was going to be a major success. And so it was. The König Pilsener Arena in Oberhausen, Germany was packed with fans on both sides, with thousands of people travelling across Europe to watch the fight. Only a fighter with the name Badr Hari could generate so much enthusiasm.   His performance during the fight was quite impressive, winning the first round and landing one jab after another, causing Rico’s nose to bleed. The disappointing way the fight ended almost made a rematch a must. While Hari’s career on the biggest kickboxing stage in the world was set for a promising rebound, a Dutch court decision sentencing him to prison in 2017 came to cast doubt on his future. His comeback to the ring against Hesdey Gerges in March 2018 would cast doubts of another kind. Hari was unimpressive, even as he scored a win against his Dutch-Egyptian rival—a win that would be later on be changed to a no-contest after both fighters failed a drug test. While these events would have meant the Moroccan legend stood no chance in his rematch against his opponent who has been dominating in his Glory fights for years, Hari seemed the better fighter as the two kickboxing stars traded shots and kicks in the Geldrome Arena in Arnhem in the Netherlands. Against all odds, Hari dropped Verhoeven to the floor with a right hand in the first round and a head-kick in the third. But, in his rush to score a knock-out,  the Moroccan kickboxer brought upon himself his own demise. Hari apparently wanted to recreate his legendary spinning back-kick knock-out against Stefan Leko in 2005. But his failed attempt resulted in a shocking injury, leaving fans with their thirst for a proper way for the fight to end, which is a with knock-out, unquenched. Hari’s unfortunate injury comes at a time where he says he is a better person now, trying to shake off the ‘Bad Boy’ image that accompanied his career, swapping it for that of a family man who brings his daughter to the arena and playfully spars with her inside the ring ahead of one of the biggest fights in the history of the game.  As Hari was carried out of the arena on a stretcher with his face buried in his hands and tears of emotion running down his cheeks, questions arise on whether he should retire. While his performance against Rico showed how much of a smart and experienced fighter he is, putting the most dominant heavyweight kickboxer today in a difficult spot, some might argue he is no longer physically prepared to compete on such a high level. Certainly only Badr Hari can make such a decision. He alone knows how long he wants to stick around in kickboxing and if he still has motivation to compete. What is sure though is that, as he turned 35, he will not have much time especially if he wanted to stay on top of his game. Whether he decides to hang the gloves or keep fighting, the Moroccan fighter has already left an undeniable mark as one of the most popular kickboxers of all-time and one of the top athletes to ever represent Morocco.

As winter weather hits Morocco, people all over the country begin to collect olives from trees in their gardens and from expansive olive tree groves across the country to crush for olive oil. However, the best time to pick olives for pickling is in September when the green olives start to turn yellowish, showing that the delicious little fruits are ripe for picking. Moroccans serve pickled olives as appetizers, with breakfast, and as an accompaniment to any main dish. Pickled olives are also a key ingredient in many tagines.   The Moroccan countryside sees olive groves spread over its vast and diverse landscape, producing various types of olive. Traditionally the red olives are used with chicken dishes, while black olives work better with tagines and fish dishes.  You can buy pickle olives in hanouts (local stores) and markets across the country, but it is just as easy to make them at home in a just a few simple steps. 2kg of green olives Plenty of water Salt 1 lemon, cut into cubes Do not forget that you will also need a kilner jar for storage. Clean the olives and drain, discarding any spoiled fruits. Make 2 to 3 incisions in each  olive. Throw the olives into the jar and cover with water.  Place the jar in a dark place, and change the water every 24 hours for a week to 10 days. After a week, taste the olives to see if they are ready for brining – they should not be bitter. When the olives are ready, drain them, and put them back in the jar. Now, add 100 grams of salt for every 1 liter of water. Add lemon stir well to dissolve the salt. You can also add garlic and bay leaves for a different flavor. Poor the brine over the olives and add some olive oil at the top to prevent the olives spoiling, then cover the jar. Keep the jar from 7 to 8 weeks. Serve them as they are or marinate them in herbs and olive oil.

Rabat- Morocco’s net international reserves have gone up by 7.1% in recent weeks, Morocco’s Central Bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), has indicated in a recent statement, suggesting the country is doing well despite some persisting challenges, external shocks . The figures point to an overall improvement in Morocco’s fiscal and monetary outlook compared to the same period last year, BAM’s statement emphasized. The assessment mostly concerns the past weeks, with the Moroccan bank also pointing out that it injected 61.2 billion dirhams in the economy from December 12-18. Meanwhile, the Moroccan Dirham appreciated by 0.36% against the Dollar and depreciated by 0.11% against the Euro during the same period. The country’s interbank rate, in the meantime, has reached 2.25%. The news mostly provides a heartening reading of Morocco’s economic performance and is somewhat reflective of the Moroccan government’s predictions for the country’s growth rate and overall economic performance for 2020. “This year has so far been marked by an improvement in the budget deficit, both in terms of rates and financial values,” the Moroccan government revealed in late July. “Economic growth prospects for 2020 indicate that there will be improvements.” In recent years, Morocco has received praise for its “economic resilience” and “sound macroeconomic policies.” Evaluating Morocco’s structural reforms in late 2017, the IMF, which considers Morocco a “good student” on fiscal reforms, applauded the North African kingdom for “improving its economic resilience, upgrade its fiscal and financial policy frameworks, and increase its economic diversification.” Feeble employment rate, a relatively weak business environment, and a persisting degree of bad governance are usually cited as the areas in which the kingdom still needs to improve as it looks to capitalize on its successful structural reforms. Still, the overall perception is that, compared to other countries in the region, Morocco can take pride in its latest economic performances. “External constraints remain strong, but internal public policy choices have played a major role” in terms of building resilience to external shocks, French economist Christian de Boissieu recently said of Morocco’s economy.

Marrakech – An orange tree was growing in the courtyard of the hotel I was staying at in Marrakech. The manager told me that if I looked down on it from the terrace, I could see a chameleon. I looked over the same leaves and branches a thousand different times without any luck.  I was told that Marrakech is the “must see” location in Morocco for all its eye-catching busyness and unique stimulation. I was also told to keep an eye out for monkeys who wander the streets in Marrakech. I am typically not one for all-things-chaotic, but something about the vibrant frenzy of culture made me understand why Marrakech is a “must see.”   I was oddly fascinated by the unfamiliar grittiness of the souq. I stepped in blood-stained cobblestone from gutted fish, smelled the stench of chickens chained to boxes, pushed my way through dozens of locals and tourists alike all trying to make their way out of the maze and into the open square.  The attention I received was unlike anywhere else I had been. In Jemaa El Fna, women under umbrellas yelled at me to come and get a henna tattoo. Vendors with trays of sunglasses told me I needed some even though I was wearing my own. Jars of crystallized mint were placed under my nose several times each with the accompanying question, “Do you know what this is?” A “pet shop” owner placed a small chameleon on my arm and let it crawl free. Gerbils, rabbits, and tiny turtles were all on display. Exotic birds were let loose and flew in a formation high above the market and circled back around to their places on the ground. Flies swarmed around the syrupy sweets in glass cases, and juice bars upon juice bars with vendors screamed at us to try their juice from their heightened stands. Who would be able to decide where to go when they are being pulled in every direction? Thank goodness my German friend was with me to pull me away from stepping on loosely lying snakes and literally watching my back as a charmer tried quietly draping a snake around my neck when I was justifiably distracted.  I stared at the city-dwellers perched in terraces drinking tea who were watching the sky mesh orange, pink, then dark behind the Atlas Mountains, stars hanging above the Koutoubia Mosque.  Candle-lit lanterns scattered patterned light across the floor of Jemaa El Fna as crowds circled around storytellers, musicians, gambling games, eating smoked street food, and dancing. In the moment, I was completely overwhelmed, and I will admit that it is difficult for me to describe the experience in a pleasing light. The historic market never stopped to breathe, and neither did I. It was only after the fact that I truly appreciated Marrakech in all its chaotic, goofy, hectic wonders. That is, apart from the monkeys in Marrakech.  We saw monkeys chained by their necks and dragged across the entirety of the square. When a tourist came to snap a photo, the handler tugged on the chain, not to encourage the monkey to perform, but to force the performance through discomfort.  I thought about the “pet shop” and how gerbils, hamsters, rabbits were crammed in cages together. Tiny turtles were piled on top of each other in bins. I was convinced the snakes were sedated as they lie limp on the ground and unenthusiastically rose up to the sound of the oboe. Exotic birds were held hostage and only flew at the swat of their handler’s hand at the unmistakable waft of tourist money.  I could not help but feel sympathetic toward all of the enslaved animals in Marrakech, and as I expressed my concern to my German friend, he responded, “That’s just how life goes.”  A pastry vendor told me “This is Africa. No one has any money here.” I find it perplexing that those who are struggling to put food on their table resort to what I see as animal cruelty as entertainment for tourists who have pockets full of cash. And it works. Tourists are spilling money to have a monkey placed on their shoulders or see one forced to do a flip, have a snake wrapped around their neck, or watch birds fly and return on command. I later learned that even if I had stepped on the snake, my chances of getting bitten were minimal. Most snakes’ fangs have been removed and mouths sewn shut. Their tongues flick out through a small gap left for them to consume liquid, but they will not last long after that. As for the “charming,” the snakes rise from the ground, not entranced by the oboe, but because they know the charmer will feed them drops of food after they rise for the tourist.  The monkeys, called macaques, are taken from their natural habitats in the nearby Atlas Mountains as babies or adolescents and are forced to wear shirts, diapers, and suffocating metal chains.  I have never been particularly fond of monkeys in general, and maybe that is because they scare me with their almost human-like characteristics. I also think that is why seeing them in chains, locked in cages, forced to do acrobatics, as tourists took photos with hanging jaws made my insides churn.  In the last few years, Morocco’s High Commission for Water and Forests has implemented several domestic laws on macaque conservation such as the prohibition of “capturing, hunting, possession, sale, and hawking” of the monkeys. However, with such high tourism rates in Jemaa El Fna, authorities do little to enforce these laws. Since monkeys are considered an opportunity for tourist money and part of cultural history, authorities are lenient in allowing handlers to show off their monkeys. Caught in the exotic and free-spirited mirage hovering over Jemaa El Fna, the tourist looks past the ugly. I specifically remember walking past a gaunt woman in torn clothes who reached her thin arms to the sky, weeping and crying out for help. Children with sunken eyes and matted hair carried tissues to sell in hopes of money.  The competitive spirit of Jemaa El Fna might be amusing at first, but it is truly a desperate and unfortunate environment as the same products are sold by thousands of different vendors, and the same animals are abused all for the tourist’s eye and the money that will buy them dinner.  In Marrakech, I was torn by a moral dilemma. Who is crossing the line of morality? Was it the handler who entertains the ignorant tourist with what could be seen as animal abuse to survive? Was it the tourist who chalks it all up to cultural differences? The relationship between the tourist, the handler, and the animals is a blurred and confusing one.  There are many accounts that face the same moral dilemma. In August, a video captured a British tourist lashing out at a chicken vendor in Tangier for what she considered was animal abuse. The chickens were kept in small cages, and she tried to break them open.  In response to the video, a spectator replied, “I pity this poor salesman who was just trying to make a living, only to be subjected to awful name-calling and gestures!” While the tourist believed she was promoting animal rights and informing an “ignorant” population about the poor treatment of animals, her actions were received as “ignorant” instead.  On TripAdvisor, a commenter stated the view that “some animals are needed to help people make a living. However, there is no excuse for barbaric cruelty.” Another traveler commented, “Marrakech is a real hot spot for abusing animals and it breaks my heart to see that tourists are encouraging and supporting animal cruelty.” I cannot help but express my concern for the treatment of animals in Marrakech, but I am caught retracing the circle of who is to blame. Though cynical, do I blame the handlers who rely on animal entertainment to make a living? Do I blame the tourist, who gives money to experience something “exotic” like never before?  I find that there is no single side to blame, because both parties actively feed into the other. My sympathy is divided between the unfortunate situation of the animals and the situation of their handlers that drives them to exploit another living thing.  As a tourist myself, I believe there is no way to fully understand another culture in its entirety and I fear imposing my own Western ideals. In the end, I felt that all I could do is acknowledge that I felt uneasy about the situation and move on.  I searched the orange tree once again when I got back to my hotel. There, in the treetop among the young, green leaves, was the chameleon camouflaged and hiding from onlookers like me. I told myself if I were a chameleon, I would hide up there too, escaping the chaos and confusion from down below.

Rabat – The fight, considered to be the biggest kickboxing fight of 2019, took place in a sold-out soccer stadium in the city of Arnhem, eastern Netherlands. In a remake of what happened in 2016, Hari outperformed Rico throughout the fight until he sustained an injury. Hari Pulled Rico down in the first and third round.  Verhoeven, known as the king of kickboxing, has held the heavyweight title for six years and defeated 55 challengers prior to this fight, including Badr Hari in December 2016. On December 10, 2016, Hari and Verhoeven met for the first time on the ring in Oberhausen, northwestern Germany. The Dutch fighter won over the Moroccan champion with a technical knockout, after Hari sustained an arm injury in the second round of the fight and could not complete the match. Many fans felt that the fight was not decisive and wanted a rematch. Tonight’s fight was Hari’s first since his 2016 injury, showing the 34-year-old’s determination to prove himself as one of the best kickboxers of all time despite his age. In a press conference in October, Hari said, “I am looking for legacy. I am looking for eternal glory. I will knock him out.” In response, the 30-year-old Verhoeven accused Hari of faking the injury in the first fight to avoid being knocked out. “In the first round, I was testing his range. I found his range in about a minute and a half. He hit me with a few jabs, it was no problem. In the second round, I began to get more aggressive, and then he quit,” said Verhoeven. It remains to be seen if tonight’s loss will lead to Hari’s retirement or motivate him even more for a rematch. After tonight’s fight, Badr Hari keeps his kickboxing record to 107 wins, with 93 knockouts, and only 14 losses, throughout his 19-year-long career. Verhoeven, on the other hand, holds 56 wins, including 16 with knockouts, and 11 losses. Hari, nicknamed the golden boy, was born and raised in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He started his professional kickboxing career in 2000, at only 16 years old. While Hari represented the Netherlands in his early career, he decided to switch his athletic allegiance to Morocco in 2005. After a lost fight in front of his Moroccan parents, Hari had to bear booing from the Dutch audience because of his accent. “I thought to myself, I have never witnessed such ungratefulness,” Hari said after the fight. At that moment, he decided to start representing Morocco.

Rabat – A “provocative” picture has emerged of two MINURSO Blue Helmets participating in a Polisario event in Tifariti, considered a “buffer zone” in the conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara region in southern Morocco. Moroccan news outlet le 360, which was the first to report on the news, indicated that the presence of MINURSO elements at the 15th Polisario congress, an annual event of “Sahrawi nationalism”-suffused speeches, is a worrying signal for MINURSO’s ability to maintain the status quo in the territorial dispute. It is even more worrying, the report stressed, that the event took place in a buffer area, a zone where MINURSO has repeatedly denounced Polisario’s “violations” in series of recent reports in the past months. In October of this year, a report from the UN Secretary-General lamented the fact that Polisario had failed “to comply with requests by MINURSO to resolve” a number of its violations in the buffer areas. Among the many violations on MINURSO’s list was Polisario’s “unauthorized relocation of an engineering company and a security detachment in Tifariti.” UN peacekeeping missions are traditionally associated with impartiality and objectivity, with Blue Helmets categorically instructed to avoid any affinity or show of support for one part in the disputes they are charged to monitor. But with the newly uncovered picture, le 360 argued, it is hard not to worry about the implications of some MINURSO members’ perceived ideological affinity with the Polisario Front. Le 360 illustrated by citing the case of Egyptian Blue Helmet Hany Mustapha, who, while serving with MINURSO in 2013, was filmed telling a group of pro-Polisario young Sahrawis that they needed to show more relentlessness and resolve in fighting against “Moroccan occupation.” The presence of the two MINURSO officers at the Polisario congress “constitutes a serious violation of the principle of impartiality,” the Moroccan newspaper emphasized, adding that such developments would also undermine MINURSO’s effectiveness in securing the cease-fire or maintaining the status quo, which is why the UN force exists in the first place. The news comes as Morocco appears to focus its Western Sahara diplomacy on “constructive dialogue” and “proactive diplomacy.” Even as it faced provocations from Polisario in recent months, including declarations of war and frequently reported military maneuverings near its defense wall, Morocco has not responded in the same muscular, show-of-force way it would some years ago. While the diplomatic shift has worked to a considerable extent, with many former pro-Polisario countries having either suspended or withdrawn their support for the cesessionist group, there are marginal voices in the Moroccan public discourse that continue to call for a kindred, muscular response to military provocations from the self-autonomy-seeking front. They argue that diplomatic success, however important, will not effectively dissuade Polisario from frequently defying the status quo and challenging Morocco’s territorial integrity. As the Western Sahara political process is set to take a new course in the wake of the uncertainty that followed Horst Kohler’s resignation as UN envoy, it remains to be seen how Morocco will balance its perceived strong commitment to a political solution and the urge to fend off Polisario movements in areas near the berm, as the Moroccan defense wall is called.

Rabat – The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, announced on Friday, December 20, that she will investigate whether Israeli actions against Palestinians amount to war crimes. Fatou Bensouda believes that “war crimes” had been or are being committed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip. Bensouda asked for a ruling on the court’s territorial jurisdiction. The prosecutor said that a preliminary examination into alleged war crimes has provided enough information to open an investigation. The examination was opened in 2015 following a case that Palestine brought. The ICC has been examining what they view as Israel-perpetrated war crimes since June 2014, one month before a war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. The war killed 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, and 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians. “I am satisfied that … war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” Bensouda said in a statement. Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. Palestinians, who have been submitting a series of complaints to launch an investigation into war crimes in Gaza, welcomed the ICC’s move. “Palestine welcomes this step as a long-overdue step to move the process forward towards an investigation, after nearly five long and difficult years of preliminary examination,” the Palestinian Authority said in a statement. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered the move a “political tool” against the Israeli state. Israel is not a member of the ICC, and the court does not have jurisdiction to rule on matters of non-member states. Bensouda had filed a request with judges to rule on what territory a future inquiry would cover because of the contested legal and factual issues of the territories. “Specifically, I have sought confirmation that the ‘territory’ over which the court may exercise its jurisdiction, and which I may subject to investigation, comprises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza,” Bensouda said. The prosecutor’s case will focus on issues like Israel’s building of settlements in the West Bank and its military operations in Gaza. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo entered the debate to declare his country’s opposition to the investigation. He considered the investigation as unfairly targeting Israel. “We firmly oppose this and any other action that seeks to target Israel unfairly,” Pompeo said in a statement.

Rabat – Turkey will no longer renew one-year residence permits given to Moroccans for tourism, which could result in Turkey expelling the thousands of Moroccans who live there. The Turkish General Directorate of Migration Management, affiliated to the Ministry of Interior, made the announcement earlier this month. Turkey is a favorite destination for thousands of Moroccans who live and work there under tourism residence permits. Some Moroccans who arrive on a tourist permit try to find work and stay in Turkey and keep renewing their one-year residence permit. The new law will only allow renewing the residence permit for touristic reasons in 2020. Moroccans who would like to stay in Turkey for work would have to apply for a different type of residence permits. “In accordance with Law No. 6458, if there are no justified reasons for staying for specific purposes, foreigners will no longer have a residence permit for a period of one year. As of January 1, 2020, requests for obtaining and extending the residence permit for the same purpose will no longer be available,” announces the Immigration Department on its website. The law does not include Syrian, Egyptian, Libyan, and Sudanese immigrants, but it concerns all other nationalities governed by the foreigners’ law, the deputy director-general of the Turkish immigration service, Kuchah Aok, told the Turkish press. If the stay of a Moroccan exceeds 90 days without a permit, they will be expelled from the country, Aok added. The amendment has sparked a large debate among Arabs in Turkey, including a large number of Moroccans, who live there without a valid permit. The change might significantly alter the flow of migration between Morocco and Turkey and force thousands of Moroccans living in Turkey to come back to Morocco. It could also affect the already shaky relations between Morocco and Turkey, following Morocco’s threats of walking out of the Free Trade Agreement between the two countries. While Morocco has been “burdened with all sorts of Turkish products” since the 2006 trade deal, Moroccan products still face customs obstacles when entering Turkish markets, according to Morocco’s Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy. Officials from the two countries held meetings in recent weeks to renegotiate the trade agreement and come up with an agreeable solution.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccan Expatriates Nasser Bourita met with his Mauritanian counterpart, Smael Ould Cheikh Ahmed, on Friday, December 20, at the eighth African Students and Youth Summit in Rabat. The meeting with Mauritania’s foreign minister aims to strengthen relations between the neighboring countries and improve their role in the security, stability, and development of West and North Africa, according to Bourita. The discussions tackled ways to boost cooperation between economic and cultural actors of the two countries as well, added the minister. For his part, the Mauritanian official said that Moroccan-Mauritanian relations are “distinguished” and should be developed even further. “We have mentioned the distinguished relations between the Kingdom of Morocco and Mauritania, as well as the joint commission between the two countries that we are working to prepare at the level of commissions from different sectors,” said the minister. Ould Cheikh commended Morocco’s support for Mauritania in the area of student training, expressing his “gratitude to the Kingdom for allowing Mauritanian students to have access to Moroccan universities, faculties, and institutes for more than 40 years.” The Mauritanian minister also explained that Mauritania shares “the same vision as Morocco” in several issues. In recent months, Morocco and Mauritania have been aiming to boost their cooperation in the diplomatic, cultural, and economic fields. On August 1, 2019, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani attended the inauguration ceremony of the new Mauritanian president, Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani. “Morocco is aiming to further reinforce its excellent and historical relation with Mauritania,” said El Othmani during his visit. In November, Morocco’s minister of youth, sports, and culture, Hassan Abyaba, signed an agreement to build a sports complex in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott, among other agreements for cultural cooperation. Mauritania’s foreign minister noted that this is his second visit to Morocco and that it would not be the last. On the same day of the meeting, Bourita held talks with Ghanaian Minister of Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway and Guinean Foreign Minister Mamadi Toure. The discussions concerned cooperation between Morocco and the two West African countries.

Rabat – Morocco is among the top five countries that satisfactorily implemented the UN’s priority human rights recommendations from the United Nations Human Rights Committee for 2019. Morocco, Argentina, Burkina Faso, Denmark, and Sweden “received the best grade during the Committee’s follow-up review of their action regarding the priority recommendations,” said a press release on the UN committee’s website. All five countries received an “A” grade which recognizes the “important steps” they took to implement the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Morocco received its “A” grade for adopting a law on the national mechanism to prevent torture, referring to the National Human Rights Council (CNDH), said the UN. Adopted unanimously by the two houses of Parliament on February 6 and 13, 2018, the law went into force on March 1 of the same year. Morocco signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on December 16, 1996. A total of 168 countries have ratified the covenant. Through the covenant, the signatories commit to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights, and rights to due process and a fair trial. The Human Rights Committee has given top ratings to five countries for satisfactorily implementing its recommendations.

Rabat – Developing employees’ skills is a core piece of achieving organizational effectiveness, and Moroccan businesses would be more successful if they adopted a new leadership strategy to accomplish that development. The main problem in some Moroccan companies is that most work processes are centralized, which can weaken the overall performance, innovation, and career development of employees. According to Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions, Moroccan companies tend to have a high level of “power distance:” Centralization is popular, and there is a big gap between managers and their subordinates. Moroccan firms should instead adopt a corporate culture based on visionary leadership and a flexible management style. Managers with high levels of visionary leadership have more effective organizations. Many management experts have said that people with good leadership skills facilitated the greatest organizational effectiveness by inspiring their colleagues to perform better and reach their company’s objectives. A visionary leader is a strategic planner who inspires other people, who makes decisions with good communication, who takes risks, and who actively listens to other people’s views regarding those decisions. The “power distance” cultural dimension, as discussed by Hofstede, is very high within Moroccan firms. Employees in such businesses feel very limited in how they can innovate and inhibited in discussing their ideas with their managers. Rather than centralization, Moroccan businesses should build a strong corporate culture based on good communication across departments, weekly meetings to discuss the current problems and suggest realistic solutions, and monthly “visionary leader” rewards for the best performing and most creative individuals. I believe that a business strategy based on strategic leadership would bring many benefits to Moroccan firms. It would allow every person within the organization to develop their skills in different areas such as communication, leadership, and teamwork. I hope that one day we will see more Moroccan organizations taking visionary leadership into account in their internal procedures and management. This kind of leadership would contribute to organizational effectiveness by making employees feel more valued, motivated, and therefore ready to achieve a high level of performance. Making employees feel valued would create a stronger workplace culture in Morocco based on respect, open communication, meeting deadlines, and being more productive in daily tasks. A good example of visionary leadership is Apple’s Steve Jobs, who had a clear vision and passion for the company, allowing employees to innovate and be creative even with a culture of strict accountability. The idea is not to follow another company’s strategy but to have a unique vision based on open communication and innovation. In order for Moroccan firms to succeed in implementing an effective management style based on a visionary style, the corporate culture and its global vision should be clearly designed around three areas: Creativity, communication, and leadership. Executive training and development programs should also be a priority in the companies’ short-term strategic goals as this will allow managers to develop their leadership and communication skills. Managers should also be aware of the importance of conveying the company’s vision, their departments’ goals, and their management style, as everyone within the company should feel valued and share his thoughts, suggestions, and ideas freely. As Robert S. Kaplan, the American accounting academic from Harvard Business School, said, “Without strong visionary leadership, no strategy will be executed effectively.” The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – The United States has re-designated Saudi Arabia as a “country of particular concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998” that has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, [and] egregious violations of religious freedom.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the announcement on Friday, December 20, through the US Department of State website. The press release, titled “United States Takes Action Against Violators of Religious Freedom,” listed multiple countries with poor religious freedom records. The designation is part of the United States’ work “to promote religious freedom and combat abuses,” says the statement. “[The designation underscores] the United States’ commitment to protect those who seek to exercise their freedom of religion or belief. We believe that everyone, everywhere, at all times, should have the right to live according to the dictates of their conscience. We will continue to challenge state and non-state entities that seek to infringe upon those fundamental rights and to ensure they are held to account for their actions,” concludes the press release. The re-designation of Saudi Arabia as a country that does not respect religious freedom is only an extension of what international human rights organizations have been condemning in regard to other human rights in recent years. In September, the Guardian reported that 15 European Union members issued a joint statement to condemn unlawful detention, the alleged use of torture, and unfair trials of activists and journalists in Saudi Arabia. In November, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report condemning the continued oppression of activists, clerics, and women in Saudi Arabia. HRW found that Saudi Arabia arrested approximately 70 people in September 2017 alone, including several clerics and religious thinkers. More recently, on December 16, Saudi Arabia stripped a Saudi journalist of his citizenship for “normalization and cooperation with Israel.” The journalist said that the loss of his citizenship came after a “ministerial decision” and that he does not know the reasons behind it. The State Department list of countries “violating religious freedoms” included Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. As for entities “of particular concern,” the list included al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Qaeda, al-Shabab, Boko Haram, the Houthis, ISIS, ISIS-Khorasan, and the Taliban.

Rabat – Hiking Morocco’s peaks, however, became an important part of exercising my own independence as a Moroccan woman. My journey to hiking mountains faced an added obstacle because I was born two months premature and have lowered immunity. Since I could not play as other kids do, I became dependent on my brother Hicham. Unwilling to play, jump, or do any sports activities, I naturally abhorred physical education during my schooling. After graduation, I gained self-confidence through engaging in community services, but exercise also became important to me. I started to go running regularly and loved it.  I discovered my passion in climbing mountains and challenged myself to reach some of the most famous summits in Morocco. I climbed Moussa mountain in the north of Morocco last summer and hiked all over Khenifra and Beni Mellal in central Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. For three years, I have dreamt of climbing a mountain in Azilal, central Morocco, known as Imsfrane to locals and the “cathedral” to foreigners. Earlier this month, I proved to myself I could be truly independent when I finally climbed it. I went with friends and took charge of the planning and organizing accommodation in the village. The trip seemed doomed from before it began. I was in panic over the fact that the weather is freezing there, but I was also determined. We took the bus from El Kelaa des Sraghna, and my beautiful female friends were eager to begin this exciting experience.  I could not take their company for granted. Because of stereotypes and prejudice in Moroccan society, parents believe that girls should not engage in this kind of sports, especially girls wearing the hijab veil. They think that girls cannot go on trips and be backpackers. With our hike up Imsfrane, I hoped to break the norms in my society. But we were still worried about the freezing weather, anxiously checking the weather on the internet. We arrived at Beni Mellal, and the weather was indeed freezing and the sky still dark. On the road to Ouawizeght village, though, our spirits stayed high as we chatted with the taxi driver. Mr. Mostapha was really taken with one of my friends and wanted his son to marry her. He spoke with enormously exaggerated words and emotions in an attempt to convince her of the marriage.  In Ouawizght village, we ate “bissara,” a well-known winter dish Moroccans eat to keep warm. After breakfast, we took another taxi to our destination: Imsfrane. The friendly taxi driver talked about the region’s geography and history as if he was narrating a documentary. Our trip continued to improve as we were delighted at the base of the mountain with excellent staff service, food, and cleaning. The beauty of Imsfrane—trees, rivers, autumn flowers, and fallen twigs—was striking. That night, we built a fire and had the chance to meet new friends who helped us light the fire. As we gathered around, our new friends, experienced hikers, told us more about the sport. They promised to climb Imsfrane with us until the summit. When morning came, I knew my dream of climbing Imsfrane was getting closer to coming true. The temperature was -2 degrees as we met our new friends and started to climb the mountain.  Confusion and a mild panic set my heart pounding when I noticed my breathing was slow and it caused a pain in my chest. I dug deep and started to motivate myself, saying, “You can do it! Yes, I can. I will make it today.” The next challenge came when one friend wanted to quit. Luckily, some boys helped and motivated her. Unexpectedly, I was soon hiking alone, with some of my group ahead of me and some behind. I did not have my backpack; I was alone without water or food for energy. Being alone on the mountain, however, brought out my courage. I had learned to depend on myself and to pay attention to the signs on the road.  I reached the summit after two hours and one minute of hiking. I shouted joyfully as I had never done before. I took photos with the first group, who had reached the summit before me. We began to descend and met the other group. My friend Fatima Zahra insisted I return to the summit and take pictures with her. I found the porter who had carried my backpack and hungrily started to eat and drink a lot of water. Fatima Zahra and I began to write mountaintop dedications to our friends and took pictures for them. The porters got angry, not believing they had carried stationary, markers, and a second set of clothes for me all the way up the mountain. They surrendered to this funny situation, and ultimately they even helped in writing the dedication. I had made it to the top of Imsfrane. Not only did I overcome stereotypes that women should not engage in activities like hiking, I had overcome my physical weakness, too.

Rabat – As he visits Morocco in prelude to the UK-Africa Summit to be held in London on January 20, Philip Parham, the special envoy for the summit, is calling for renewed UK-Africa engagements by giving “a new impetus to direct engagement” and transcending the weight of a history that has been marked by the West’s propensity to preach to the continent. The idea that Brexit will be bad for the UK economy has become a mantra in a considerable section of the narrative around post-Brexit UK, with some especially contending that leaving the EU will be the last straw for the UK’s dimming claim to global prestige. But that the argument has stubbornly been around—and been defended by most expert predictions—does not seem to negatively affect the confidence of the British government in the country’s ability to not only survive the post-Brexit storms, but to actually thrive in a context of a fast-moving, multipolar globalization. As the country decides to leave a club many felt was good for Britain, it is perhaps time to prepare for the challenges of the order to come, the post-Brexit optimism seems to suggest. This, according to Parham’s press conference at the British ambassador’ residence in Rabat earlier today, would mostly consist in coming up with a new vision for maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, Britain’s global prestige and outreach. To be fair, Parham did not directly reference Brexit, nor were post-Brexit-related arguments manifestly discernible as he addressed a roomful of Moroccan journalists. But the spirit was there, with the UK official repeatedly mentioning the UK’s new ambitions in an African continent that is increasingly becoming, for better or worse, the battle ground for much of global investment flows. Parham is mostly in Morocco to lay the groundwork for the January UK-Africa Investment Summit, to set the tone of the meeting. His goal, like the summit’s, for that matter, is mostly to “explore investment potential” in Africa and help the British government and British companies, as well as “African partners,” to seize the vast opportunities that could come from new UK-Africa engagements. “The reason for the summit is to increase the flow of British investments in Africa,” he said. He continued by rather optimistically outlining “what the UK specifically brings” to the investment and sustainable growth conversations in Africa and how, in a context of increasing global connections, a post-Brexit UK wants to carve up new venues and new ways–or at least more effective ways–of connecting with Africa . “We will be arranging the summit to maximize the opportunities for direct engagement between governments and businesses and between government and governments, and between businesses and businesses,” he offered. The overriding goal, he emphasized, is to create “a new partnership” between Africa and the UK, “in particular, a new partnership which creates and sustains jobs, which will be probably be one key theme of the whole summit.” Parhams’s expose, as he briefly highlighted “sustainable finance,” trade barriers, and economic growth opportunities as the focus of the UK-Africa summit, gave a rosy, heartening picture of a Britain that is both aware of the challenges it is getting into and prepared to make a compelling case for its “new impetus”-driven agenda. 2Parham’s overall picture was optimistic, uplifting even for what can be summarized as the new diplomatic vision of a post-Brexit UK looking to remain an important global player. But was it realistic? Are the goals even attainable? How, for example, does the UK plan to deal with the stern competition from players like the US, China, France, and even the EU as a whole in what some analysts have already termed as the “new scramble for Africa?” What exactly does the UK bring to an overcrowded conversation on investment in Africa? Will Britain compete to have a prominent spot or will it simply be happy to be just another actor trying to get as much as it can from its “new partnership” with Africa? Parham did not directly take on such concerns, either because these were not specifically asked by any of the journalists present as he spoke, or because, as an unarticulated note of caution, it is a little too soon to engage in full-throated assessments of an agenda that will only be effectively in place once the soon-to-be-held UK-Africa summit is all done with. In that sense, it could be said that what will happen in London next month is set to dictate much of what will happen in UK-Africa ties in the months and years afterwards. For Parham, though, the special status of the city of London as a world-renowned, coveted destination for investors and businesses, as well as the widely acknowledged commitment of the British government to “sustainable growth and development,” are two essential features that post-Brexit Britain will bring to the conversation table. In quantitative terms, while the UK has invested up £2 billion in Africa in recent years, it expects to “invest even more in the continent in years to come,” he confidently revealed. The ultimate goal of the summit and its aftermath, he stressed, is to both “explore” existing potential for investments and growth and “expand direct engagement with African partners” to drive the march towards “clean energies” and “sustainable investments” in Africa. One recurring argument in African policy circles is the idea that European countries have been historically arrogant, entitled, and condescending in how they relate to the continent. How does the UK plan to respond to such criticism of Europe’s or the West’s neocolonial presence in Africa? “It’s a trap to easily fall into,” Parham tartly acknowledged, speaking of the perceived Eurocentric, self-righteous pedestal from which most Western partners look at Africa. But it will be different for the UK-Africa Investment Summit, he argued. “This is about equal partnership. This is not about teaching anyone anything on development or growth; or about telling people how things should be done. This is basically about what we can do together.” Because it would have been diplomatically misplaced not to speak about Morocco, Parham referenced the North African kingdom’s importance in the UK’s “new vision” for Africa. Britain sees “Morocco as a gateway to Africa,” he announced, hastening to provide an illustrious litany of the notable achievements Morocco has made of late, both on the domestic and transnational fronts. Morocco’s success stories in areas like “clean energy,” renewables, investments, and economic growth, he illustrated, are part of the many reasons why the UK-Africa summit is “about cooperation, what we can do together to move further in the right direction.” “Of course, a lot of this is very relevant to Morocco, and we are delighted that Morocco is one of the countries that will be coming to participate in this summit,” he said. “Morocco is itself a significant player for Africa and an investor elsewhere in Africa. So we see Morocco as a very important gateway to Africa and partner for collaborations in many of these areas across the continent.” In this, Parham was echoing a sticking point from a series of interviews that the British ambassador to Rabat, Thomas Reilly, had with many Moroccan outlets in the immediate aftermath of the recent signing of a post-Brexit continuity agreement between Rabat and London. “My government sees Morocco as a gateway to Africa. Morocco really knows a lot about Africa, and we know some parts of Africa. So this deal is really about bringing our strategic relations to the next level,” Ambassador Reilly recently told Morocco World News. While the gateway comment is particularly witty, even if it does not especially differ from the usual, image-stuffed umbrella terms diplomats heavily rely on to navigate fraught, sensitive terrains, Parham ended his conference with even wittier lines. He stressed the effectiveness-driven agenda that post-Brexit Britain wants to live by as it looks to join the now fashionable race of seducing African partners. “I finally want to underline that the summit is the beginning of an end. We are not doing the summit just for the sake of doing a summit; we are doing it in order to have an impact for many years into the future. It’s the beginning of a new impetus,” he said.

We can only be optimistic about the announcement of the members on Morocco’s new development model committee, released on December 12, 2019. Moroccan Ambassador to France Chakib Benmoussa will lead the committee after being appointed on November 19. After King Mohammed VI outlined the need for a new development model in his 2019 Throne Day speech and again in the King and People’s Revolution speech on August 20, Moroccans noticed a significant increase in public debate among civil society, political parties, intellectuals, and the Moroccan diaspora, even before the announcement of the list and the appointment of the president. This movement is an essential indication of the importance of the involvement of everyone in building Morocco’s future, where territorial justice and social development is concerned. The reason for our optimism is that the list followed the directives of the royal speeches to include a new generation, a new mentality, and a Moroccan-Moroccan model, while defining the committee’s work. It is difficult to form a committee of 35 competent Moroccans who will voluntarily work on a new development model. They have to answer the aspirations of the younger generations and use the knowledge gained from experience.  The committee will dissolve after presenting the new development model to King Mohammed VI before June 2020. The 2019 speech on Throne Day was the reason behind the launch of the committee. The 2019 speech of the King and People’s Revolution considered the new development model as an excellent gateway towards the future.  Morocco should not miss the opportunity for this new quiet revolution. This revolution is three-dimensional: A revolution in simplification, a revolution in efficiency, and a revolution in creation. The new development model committee’s list includes six members of the Moroccan diaspora, who will be able to participate in Moroccan public affairs and making its future.  The diaspora Moroccans on the committee is an expression of the King’s keenness to integrate them into promising national development projects.  Moroccans abroad are an essential part of the committee as indisputably competent in their various fields. This will add value to the committee’s work. Our optimism is based on the criteria of including a new generation with new mindsets and adopting competencies set by the 2019 speeches of the Throne and the King and People’s Revolution. The six international Moroccans who are part of the committee all embody these criteria, which highlights diversity, pluralism, competence, and youth. The six work in a diversity of fields between economy, business, banking, environment, digitization, artificial intelligence, teaching, scientific research, and intangible capital.  They are also mostly young people with linguistic and cultural plurality.  Most of diaspora Moroccans on the committee are multilingual and have a multiplicity of experiences in their countries of residence, from English influence to Francophone experiences, and other European and international influences, in addition to their homeland languages, such as Arabic, Amazigh (Berber), and others.  Many of the international Moroccans are also writers.  The six have also maintained ties with Morocco even before their appointment to the committee. Abraham Zawi, for example, received a royal decoration in 2014, and Rachid Benzine has been a member of the Council of the Moroccan Community Living Abroad (CCME) since 2016. These members will provide the committee with a Moroccan-Moroccan standard. But they will also present experiences from other countries, especially since all six members occupy senior positions in their fields of work.  For example, Ahmed Bounfour is an international expert in the management of intangible capital and works with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as a visiting professor. As for Rachid Guerraoui, he works at the College de France, an old institution established in the 16th century that specializes in scientific research and education.  Guerraoui also works in Silicon Valley, California, where major technology and software companies, such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, and eBay, have their headquarters. The importance of Silicon Valley led the country of Denmark to appoint a “digital ambassador” in it. Narjis Hilale is a university professor in Geneva and an expert in artificial intelligence and women’s empowerment.  For Abraham Zawi, it is enough to mention that he was vice president of the American financial institution Morgan Stanley. Fouad Laroui teaches humanities at the University of Amsterdam and is an engineer with a Ph.D. in economics.  Rachid Benzine focuses on religious dialogue and has published articles in major French newspapers. Abdellatif Miraoui is a professor at the University of Technology in France and holds a Ph.D. in electronic technology and a diploma of in-depth studies in electronic engineering and industrial information. He also chairs the University of Marrakech and the Francophone University Agency (AUF). We believe, in all honesty, that the contributions of diaspora Moroccans in preparing the new development model will be decisive as they represent a new generation and have new mindsets.  They grew up abroad but remained faithful to their Moroccan identity and have maintained their links to both Morocco and their countries of residence.

Rabat – African Foreign Ministers paid tribute to Morocco, on Friday in Rabat, for its support in favor of training the continent’s youth. The praise came during the opening of the eighth edition of the African Students and Youth Summit, organized by “All Africa Students Union” in partnership with the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI). Ghana’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway hailed Morocco for “opening its doors” to many Ghanaian students in recent years. Ghanaian students in Morocco have pursued their studies in several disciplines including medicine, pharmacy, electrical and mechanical engineering, architecture, applied sciences, commerce and management, tourism, mathematics, IT, and agronomy. For his part, Mauritanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ismael Ould Cheikh Ahmed expressed his country’s gratitude to Morocco for its support in training Mauritanian students for almost 40 years. Guinean Minister of Foreign Affairs Mamadi Touri voiced his country’s thanks to Morocco for awarding hundreds of scholarships to Guinean students each year. Torui welcomes Morocco’s African policy aimed at strengthening a win-win partnership with the countries of the continent. For his part, Minister of Foreign Affairs ofComoros Amine Souaf paid tribute to the “commendable action” of Morocco in developing human resources in Africa, adding that several Comorian executives, including ministers, have been trained in Morocco.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Table Tennis Federation has withdrawn from a competition in Oran, Algeria. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) shared a statement from the federation, in which it denounced actions against Morocco’s territorial integrity in the competition. The federation said that it received an invitation to take part in the Zone 1 championship from December 19 to 22. Two Moroccan table tennis players went to take part in the competition along with a member of the federation’s board. Upon their arrival, the representative of the federation’s executive office was surprised to find a truncated map of Morocco without its southern provinces in Western Sahara in the official logo of the competition. The southern provinces were replaced by a flag of the self-proclaimed SADR, the statement explained. The representative of the federation eventually expressed strong condemnation and sent a letter to the president of the African Zone 1 and the organizers. The press release emphasized that the federation had decided to “take all steps with regional, continental, and international authorities to condemn this irresponsible act.” Algeria opposes Morocco’s territorial integrity and position regarding the Western Sahara conflict. It also hosts and finances the Polisario Front. Morocco has been calling on Algeria to engage in a political dialogue to end the conflict, but Algeria continues to pledge support for the front. The most recent statement against Morocco’s position came just after the inauguration of Algeria’s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Thursday, December 19. The new president described the issue as “a question of decolonization.” The chairman of the Algerian National Committee for Solidarity with the Sahrawi People, Said Layachi, also expressed Algeria’s “unwavering support for the Sahrawi cause and the struggle of the Sahrawi people for freedom and independence,” a red line for Morocco’s territorial integrity.

Rabat – Witnesses of human rights breaches in Tindouf, Algeria, have spoken publicly about ill-treatment that Sahrawis are experiencing in the Tindouf camps. On Wednesday, December 18, the Sahara League for Democracy and Human Rights brought together former Polisario members and prisoners who shared their stories of a long list of rights violations against Sahrawis in Tindouf camps. The group met at the Swiss Press Club in Geneva. Adnane Braih, the brother of a kidnapped Polisario leader, Ahmed El Khalil Braih, also participated in the press conference to speak about his relative’s case. El Khalil went missing 10 years ago under uncertain circumstances. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. El Khalil’s brother told the press conference that the kidnapping happened just before an investigation “which he was to conduct into the deaths of approximately 160 people, including women and children, in the 1980s and 1990s.” Adnane Braih said that his family is carrying out an international campaign, urging the Polisario Front to disclose El Khalil’s fate.  Sahara League President Hammada Labaihi, who lived in the Tindouf camps for 40 years, also commented on the allegations of human rights violations in the camps, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. He spoke publicly on the “cruelty” and other allegations, including the embezzlement of humanitarian aid destined for Sahrawis in the region. Amid a shortfall in the funding to supply Sahrawis with aid, several international media warned the UN of embezzlement scandals in the Tindouf camps by Polisario members. The population in the camps are suffering from malnutrition and related health issues, such as anemia.  “This meeting aims to make the voices of our brothers and sisters kidnapped in the Tindouf camps heard and to expose the degrading practices which the separatist leaders have engaged in against the Sahrawis for decades,” Labaihi said. The former Polisario member also urged the international community to intervene and end the struggle of the Sahrawis in the camps.  Labahi also recalled that Sahrawis in Tindouf are “deprived of their most basic rights, in particular the right to travel, expression and work in [Algeria] in violation of the United Nations charters and High Commissioner for Refugee procedures.” Oppression in Polisario-run prisons The situation in the camps is worse in Polisario-run prisons. Speaking at the press conference, former prisoner Ahmed Kher told of how he spent 14 years in detention before returning to Morocco. He said that Polisario uses abuse and torture to prevent anyone from opposing its leadership. He said that the population in Tindouf is kept in the camps “against their will in an open-air prison without any legal document.” He also echoed Labahi’s statement, calling on the international community to stop the “serial violations” of rights. It is not the first time prisoners and former Polisario members have told their experiences of rights violations in Tindouf. A group of 126 prisoners in the Polisario-run prison of Al Rachid near Tindouf wrote a letter to condemn the rights violations they are subject to by the executive committee of the Polisario Front. “We are the victims of the terrible El Rachid prison near the Sahrawi camps in Tindouf, southwestern Algeria. We are the signatories of the letter. Following the horrific [violence] we have been subjected to, we address the Sahrawi, international and regional public opinion and the readers to share our suffering [with you].” The Sahrawi prisoners also accused leading members of the Polisario Front, including Al Bashir Mustafa Al Sayed, of serious human rights violations. “We want to expose the crimes we were exposed to in El Rachid prison and to enlighten Sahrawi public opinion. We also want to the [Polisario Front] to uncover the fate of the missing, martyrs, and remains of people [buried] in secret graves,” the victims added.

Rabat – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) gave a loan of  MAD 165 million ( €15 million) to Banco Sabadell Succursale Casablanca (BSC) to help finance small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Morocco. Both banks signed an agreement for the loan on December 19, allowing BSC to finance SMEs, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Banco Sabadell Branch Casablanca (BSC) was established in 2009 as the Moroccan branch of Spain’s fourth-largest banking group, Banco Sabadell SA (BS). The news agency added that the agreement is “in line with the strong economic ties between the EBRD, Morocco and Spain, with the presence of a dense network of more than 600 Spanish companies in the Kingdom and a total of almost €4.5 billion in cumulative investments.” A founding member of the EBRD, Morocco became a country of operations in 2012.  The bank invested approximately €2 billion in Morocco through 60 projects. Morocco has received multiple loans recently from different international institutions, including the African Development Bank (AfDB), the World Bank, and the European Investment Bank.  Earlier this month, the World Bank pledged to lend Morocco $275 million as a disaster risk management development policy loan. The African Development Bank (AfDB) approved on November 28 a €100 million credit line for the Municipal Equipment Fund (FEC) to finance new projects of investment and utilities in Morocco.  The EU Investment Bank also approved a total of €401.5 million funding to develop renewable energy projects. The loans raise question about whether the loans will make Morocco’s public external debt unsustainable, weighing down its economic development with the high cost of interest payments. Several top bankers and officials have warned Morocco of the consequences of high debt. Last year, the central bank governor, Abdellatif Jouahri, said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6% of Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, up from 13.8% of GDP in 2018. Global database website CEIC shows that Morocco’s external debt reached $51.3 billion in March 2019.

Rabat – Following the opening of a Comorian consulate in Laayoune, a city in the Western Sahara region of southern Morocco, the Algerian government expressed its disapproval of the act on Thursday, December 19. “This measure of exceptional gravity represents a flagrant violation of the norms of international law… It represents an attack on the rules and principles that should govern inter-African relations,” said the Algerian Foreign Ministry in a press release relayed by the Algerian press agency. The decision “constitutes an unacceptable precedent for undermining the principles governing the status of non-autonomous territories whose peoples have not yet practiced their right to self-determination in accordance with the doctrines of the UN and the African Union,” adds the official document. The ministry’s publication came on the first workday of Algeria’s new president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune. As early as his inauguration ceremony, Tebboune expressed Algiers’ stance on the Western Sahara conflict. In his speech, the new president described the issue as “a question of decolonization.” On the same day, the chairman of the Algerian National Committee for Solidarity with the Sahrawi People, Said Layachi, expressed Algeria’s “unwavering support for the Sahrawi cause and the struggle of the Sahrawi people for freedom and independence.” The Comoros opened a consulate in Laayoune on December 18, with an inauguration ceremony chaired by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his Comorian counterpart. During the ceremony, Bourita announced that at least four more African countries will open consulates in Laayoune in 2020. He also recalled Gambia’s decision to open a consulate in the Moroccan city of Dakhla, also in Western Sahara. Bourita explained that opening diplomatic representations in Morocco’s southern provinces will “strengthen the vocation of the region as the gateway to Morocco on the African continent.” The consulates will also reinforce economic and commercial cooperation between Morocco and other African countries, added the minister. “The opening of the consulate is an event of great significance [as it answers] the question of the Moroccaness of [the Western] Sahara,” said Bourita. In June, Cote d’Ivoire opened a consulate in Laayoune, upsetting the Polisario Front and the leadership of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

Rabat – The European Commission granted Morocco €389 million as part of its support for Moroccan reforms, inclusive development, and border management, on Friday, December 20. The financial support will contribute to the development of the “Euro-Moroccan Partnership for Shared Prosperity” announced at the end of the 14th meeting of the Morocco-EU Association Council held in Brussels on June 27. “Morocco has long been a privileged partner of the European Union with which we share our borders and aspirations”, stressed the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Josep Borrell. A European Commission statement quoted Borell, who said: “Under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, Morocco has made important modernization steps and has made rapprochement with Europe a strategic choice.” He affirmed that “faced with common challenges, the time has come to give new impetus to our relations with deeper and more diversified cooperation, including Africa, to connect our futures and bring our people closer together.” Meanwhile, the European commissioner for European neighborhood policy and enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, noted that “Morocco plays a crucial role as a partner of the European Union.” Varhelyi added that the European Commission will support Morocco in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth, fighting irregular migration networks, and improving the protection of migrants. He concluded that the EU will continue assisting Morocco to address its social and economic issues. On December 11, the EU gave Morocco an installment of €101.7 million of funds promised in 2018 to fight illegal immigration and human trafficking.

Around 63 artists from 27 countries and different disciplines exhibited their works at the event. The theme of the first biennial was “An Instant Before the World.” FNM, created in 2011, is an independent non-profit institution that manages Morocco’s public museums. It currently manages 13 museums in eight different cities. The foundation’s missions also include the promotion of Morocco’s culture and heritage.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita launched the eighth annual African Students &amp; Youth Summit Friday, December 20, in Rabat.  The four-day event aims to enable young Africans to propose new recommendations and initiatives to develop the African continent, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The event brings over 1,000 participants of 70 nationalities to a collaboration space designed for networking, cultural exchange, and innovation.  The eighth African Students &amp; Youth Summit will also host the launch of “Maroc-Alumni,” a digital platform initiated by the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The platform offers an interactive space where students can exchange ideas and benefit from valuable services.   Africa should invest in youth Bourita received the foreign ministers of Mauritania, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia, and the Comoros Friday morning at the International University City in Rabat (CUI). The ministers went on to deliver speeches during the event’s opening ceremony.  In his opening speech, Bourita welcomed the African foreign ministers as well as the participating student associations and other attendees to the summit.  Bourita described the summit’s ability to mobilize African students and youth before lauding King Mohammed VI’s unifying, pragmatic, and benevolent leadership.  The Moroccan foreign minister quoted King Mohammed VI’s speech from the 29th African Union summit to underscore Morocco’s commitment to Africa and its youth.  “The future of Africa depends on its youth,” the sovereign stated in August 2017 in a message delivered by his brother in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “Today, nearly 600 million Africans are young people. In 2050, 400 million Africans will be between 15 and 24 years old.”  Africa’s young population “underlines the urgency of orienting the demographic dividend towards the emergence of the continent,” the King’s speech continued. “Africa, therefore, has an unexpected opportunity to benefit from a young, educated, and abundant workforce to fuel its economic growth.” Bourita went on to describe Morocco’s role in training tens of thousands of students from 47 African countries since King Mohammed VI ascended to the throne in 1999.  He added that more than 5,000 public sector executives in various African countries have benefited from Moroccan training. “Youth training represents a priority area of South-South cooperation,” the Moroccan minister stated, explaining that the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI) oversees youth training programs.  “[AMCI] is a united and active cooperation oriented towards youth and based on the sharing of experience in sectors [relevant] to [African labor market needs].”   African talent should stay in Africa Bourita shifted his speech to address the summit’s young participants directly. He began by recalling another key statement from King Mohammed VI at the 29th African Union Summit: “It is not acceptable that … the best African talents are the object of European lusts, in defiance of the investment of their country of origin in terms of training,” King Mohammed VI remarked during his speech at the summit.   “You are these talents,” Bourita said to the audience of African students and youth. “There is no better destination for African talent than their own continent.” Bourita expressed that the Kingdom of Morocco wants Africa’s youth to have confidence in their future while still considering the pressing challenges faced by the continent and its people. “The emergence of our [continent] is in your hands,” he declared. “You have the opportunity to rethink African development in a more innovative, more creative, younger way.” Education, training, employment In accordance with Morocco’s royal vision, “education must be guaranteed, training must be accelerated, and jobs must be created,” Bourita asserted. “Africa cannot be seen as a mere pool of opportunities,” he continued. “Africa needs to create and seize its own opportunities and generate its own wealth.” The Moroccan minister explained that in order to seize opportunities, Africa must invest in its entrepreneurs with joint efforts from the public and private sectors, along with the banking and financial sectors.  He also encouraged greater access to finance for start-ups.  “Access to finance should not be used as an instrument of obstruction,” he said. “If talent is universal, its realization is not. We must help it to hatch, support it, enhance it and empower it.” He went on to state that youth must have greater access to decision-making and civic participation. The Moroccan minister concluded his speech by communicating Morocco’s hope for the future of African youth.   “The wish of Morocco is that African talents are never used … to swell the ranks of disenchanted and vulnerable targets of all extremism.” “I hope that this 8th edition of the Students and Youth Summit of Africa will be an opportunity to reflect, exchange and involve both young students, researchers and decision-makers from the public and private sectors in order to deepen the debates and bring out strong recommendations,” he said of the summit.  He concluded, saying, “I wish you every success in your work. Long live African youth, long live Africa.” The summit was organized under the patronage of King Mohammed VI.

Rabat – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed international football player Mesut Ozil for his statements against China’s harsh treatment of Uighur Muslims. Pompeo posted a tweet strongly condemning China’s state television channel CCTV for removing an Arsenal-Manchester City match due to Ozil’s criticism. Last week, the Arsenal football player used social media to speak out about the situation of Uighur Muslims suffering in detention. In addition to China, Ozil also condemned Muslims for staying quiet on the ill-treatment of Uighur Muslims. Pompeo added onto Ozil’s statement and has condemned CCTV for not broadcasting the match. Even after the English football club distanced itself from Ozil’s statement and said that it is always “apolitical as an organization,” CCTV declined to broadcast the match. Pompeo said the truth about the human rights violations against the Uighur Muslims “will prevail” eventually. “China’s Communist Party propaganda outlets can censor @MesutOzil1088 and @Arsenal’s games all season long, but the truth will prevail,” Pompeo wrote on December 17. He also described China’s treatment of its Muslim citizens as “gross human rights violations.” China’s Communist Party propaganda outlets can censor @MesutOzil1088 and @Arsenal’s games all season long, but the truth will prevail. The CCP can’t hide its gross #HumanRights violations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) December 17, 2019  “The CCP can’t hide its gross #HumanRights violations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world,” he added. The US State Department renewed its designation of China as a “country of particular concern” for engaging in “systematic, ongoing, [and] egregious violations of religious freedom” on Wednesday, December 18. Rights NGOs have been condemning China for its systematic rounding up of Uighurs and placing them in detention camps, which China denies. Human Rights Watch described  the actions taken against the Uighur Muslims as “rampant abuses” that “violate fundamental rights to freedom of expression, religion, and privacy, and protections from torture and unfair trials.” China, however, calls the detention camps “voluntary” and says they are re-education centers to combat extremism.  Earlier this year, leaked Chinese documents revealed a memo from 2017 giving instructions on how to run the camps. In the memo,  the chief deputy of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, said camp staff must “strictly manage and control student activities to prevent escapes during class, eating periods, toilet breaks, bath time, medical treatment, family visits, etc.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has given a speech to the first National Conference on Advanced Regionalization in Agadir on December 20, calling on the government to take the regionalization process seriously. Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit read the message of the King to the conference, convening at least 1,400 attendees. Throughout his recent speeches, the monarch has been calling on political leaders to put in place a new paradigm to meet the demands and aspirations of citizens and establish economic opportunities as well as administrative accountability. Advanced regionalization seeks to improve public services and to increase administrative performance at the service of citizens. The King has acknowledged Morocco’s notable achievements in recent years in terms of infrastructure and business, but says more work should be done to meet citizens’ demands. The development model has a concern for the monarch, who called for a new one to cover all expectations and aspirations. In his speech, the monarch called on local governments, administrations, and all public institutions to “mobilize their human, financial and logistical resources to provide fair and efficient public services throughout the Kingdom.” The monarch recognized that all efforts to implement the regionalization project “will still fall short” of Morocco’s expectations as “long as it is not accompanied by a set of indispensable measures that make it possible for regions to exercise their powers fully and more effectively.” For the King, it is important to speed up the process of administrative decentralization. Decentralization plans “must be based on actual devolution to regions of function-related and decision-making powers,” he said. Opening to private sector King emphasized that public investment is not enough by itself to ensure better development momentum. He called for the private sector to engage and ensure success of the regionalization project. “It is important to take the necessary measures to inform private investors of investment opportunities at the regional level, particularly with regard to real estate, land use planning and development sectors that represent a priority for the region concerned,” said the King. The monarch echoed a call he made during the opening of the legislative year in October. In a speech then, the King urged the private sector, especially banks and financial institutions to play an integral part in Morocco’s new development model. The King concluded his message to the conference, hoping for the symposium to be a “special opportunity for careful reflection, fruitful research and serious dialogue to make an accurate assessment of the outcome of efforts to implement advanced regionalization.” Hundreds of attendees are taking part in the conference, including elected officials, representatives of various ministries, academics, and international experts.

Rabat – France and Morocco had fruitful discussions on bilateral relations during the 14th high-level meeting between the countries on December 19 in Paris. As a Moroccan priority, the Western Sahara was on Morocco’s agenda for the French-Moroccan talks on Thursday. State-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) shared a joint statement at the end of the meeting, in which France reaffirmed its support for Morocco’s autonomy plansubmitted to the Security Council in 2007 as a proposal to help end the dispute. Western Sahara and security talks France reiterated its position on the dispute, describing the initiative as “a serious and credible basis for a negotiated political solution.” “France commends the serious and credible efforts made by Morocco to move forward towards a settlement of the Sahara issue,” the statement. France also repeated its traditional position on the UN-led political process, emphasizing its support for a “just, lasting, mutually acceptable and compromise-based political solution, under the aegis of the United Nations and in accordance with Security Council resolutions.” Both Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and French Prime Minister Edward Philippe chaired the high-level meeting. The officials expressed their countries’ determination to boost cooperation in different fields, including security, sustainable development, the rule of law, and cultural diversity. “This commitment will be reflected in particular on the occasion of the second Ministerial Conference on Peacekeeping in the French-speaking area to be held in Rabat and which the two countries will co-chair on 23-24 April, 2020,” the declaration said. The French prime minister spoke about the cooperation between Morocco and France in the fight against irregular migration, human trafficking, and terrorism. He also spoke about Morocco’s efforts to address security challenges throughout the region, including in the Sahel-Saharan zone. Business In addition to the Western Sahara conflict, the countries discussed ways to boost trade and cooperation. In a joint press conference, Philippe said that France is “the first economic partner of Morocco.” He also remarked that more than 900 subsidiaries of French companies are operating in Morocco, which generate nearly 120,000 jobs. Trading Economics reported that French exports to Morocco were estimated at $5.2 billion in 2018.  France and Morocco concluded the meeting with the signing of nine bilateral cooperation agreements in different areas to boost collaboration. El Othmani said that the signing of the agreements “illustrate the promising prospects for cooperation and bilateral relations.”

Rabat – Morocco has signed a loan agreement of €150 million with France to fund Morocco’s employment policy for the economic integration of youth. Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani signed the agreements with French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe as part of the 14th France-Morocco High-Level Meeting on Thursday, December 19. The loan will fund economic integration projects in three pilot regions of Morocco’s 12 regions: the Souss-Massa around Agadir, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra around the capital region, and Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima where Riffians have been complaining of social and economic marginalization for years. The loan was among other agreements Morocco signed with France on the economic, social, and cultural sectors, including five “declarations of intent.” The agreements cover urban planning, industrial property, education, decentralized cooperation, spatial planning, territorial cohesion, housing, town policy, and territorial development. One administrative agreement will develop cooperation on the industrial property for “vulnerable adults” between the French National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) and the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC), according to Maghreb Arab Press. In addition to industrial property, the two officials also signed a cooperation accord in the areas of pre-school education, teachers’ initial and vocational training, and inclusive education. El Othmani and Philippe also signed declarations of intent to increase decentralization cooperation, including impact studies, codification, and the vocational training of legal advisers. Further partnerships between Moroccan and French higher education institutions was also among the agreements the two countries signed. Finally, France’s Arab World Institute and the Museums Foundation of the Kingdom of Morocco (FNMM) agreed to collaborate. The signing ceremony was attended by a Moroccan delegation including the entire Moroccan cabinet.

Rabat – Morocco will finally receive an American ambassador after the US Senate approved President Trump’s nomination of David T. Fischer as US ambassador to the North African country after several years. Trump first nominated Fischer as ambassador to Morocco in November 2017. But the businessman began his confirmation hearing in the US Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relation almost a year later, in August 2018. The impeached president is entrusting American diplomacy in Morocco to Fischer, who contributed an estimated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration fund.  In his statement to the Senate committee as a nominee in August 2018, the ambassador vowed to work to reinforce the US-Morocco friendship and “continued economic, political, and security collaboration.” He added that the cooperation with Morocco is “vital and must be strengthened.” At least 120 American companies operate in Morocco. Annual Moroccan-American trade has exceeded MAD 51 billion ($5.3 billion), an increase of 28% from 2017, the Moroccan government said. It remains to be seen whether the new US ambassador will help boost trade and US- Morocco collaboration. Career businessman The new ambassador to Morocco was born in 1946 in southeastern Michigan, where his business career also started. Fischer’s father owned a car dealership in Troy, Michigan.  Fischer did not become a businessman only by instinct. The diplomat studied business at Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, graduating in 1968.  Fischer started his business career at his father’s car dealership after graduation. He spent his first years in the industry as an advisor to his father’s business before taking over the work in 1978. Fischer developed his father’s business, the Suburban Collection, into the 14th largest car sales group in the US in 2017.  Fischer’s company has 36 dealerships across Michigan. The newly appointed ambassador to Morocco has spent all his life in business. He also served as chairman of the Detroit Auto Dealer Association in 1987. Fischer also served as president and chairman emeritus of the North American International Auto Show. In addition to business, Fischer is known as a philanthropist in the Detroit area. He is on the board of the College for Creative Studies and headed up a fundraising campaign for the college. Fischer also served as a member of the State of Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission until December 2017. Besides all of these offices he assumed during his career, Fischer is also a husband to Jennifer Fischer and a father to three sons. Unknown Quantity Fischer has no history with Morocco, which makes him an unknown quantity for Moroccan diplomats. The approval of Fischer to assume office in Rabat comes a few weeks after the “important” visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rabat, where he met with senior Moroccan officials to discuss ways to deepen diplomatic relations between the two allies. For Morocco, every senior appointment in the White House is important to preserve cooperation with the US for several reasons, including the issue of the Western Sahara conflict. The Moroccan government had fears after Trump appointed John Bolton, later sacked, to his cabinet. The official holds grudges against the UN mission in Western Sahara known as MINURSO and wanted to speed up the process to hold a referendum, which is against Morocco’s position on the conflict. Fischer, however, vowed in his previous audicenes to keep a neutral position with regards to the conflict.  Last year in August, the ambassador recalled the US’s policy of supporting the UN-led efforts to find a “just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict,” when a senator asked about his thoughts on the dispute. Fischer also spoke about the UN mission and the efforts of the former Personal Envoy Horst Kohler and the UN talks with the parties to find a solution to the dispute.

Rabat – Relations between China and Arab countries develop “very fast,” and Beijing seeks to further strengthen these relations, said China’s Special Envoy for Middle East Affairs Zhai Jun on Wednesday at the eighth forum on Chinese-Arab cooperation in Rabat.  Speaking at a press conference, Jun underlined China’s actions to strengthen relations with Arab countries, stressing the importance of developing economic, commercial, and cultural exchanges as well as promoting the values of diversity, peace, openness, and progress. Commenting on the Palestinian issue, the diplomat said the deadlock in the peace process could have harmful consequences, noting that stability in the Near East region requires an agreement between the parties. Regarding relations between Morocco and China, Jun noted “a development” in bilateral economic and trade cooperation, which nevertheless remains below expectations and the quality of political relations between the two countries. He said Beijing and Rabat should explore new areas of cooperation, such as infrastructure and investment. In the education sector, the Chinese diplomat highlighted the decision of the Beijing government to grant 30 scholarships to Moroccan students, noting an increase in the number of Moroccans who choose to pursue their studies in China. Regarding the tourism sector, Jun praised Morocco’s decision to exempt Chinese nationals from visas, a measure likely to encourage them to visit the kingdom in large numbers, particularly with the upcoming inauguration of direct airlines. The eighth Chinese-Arab Relations Conference and the dialogue between the Arab and Chinese civilizations wrapped up Wednesday with the adoption of a final declaration that calls for studying the possibility of setting up a Chinese-Arab institution in charge of promoting cultural pluralism. Participants in the two-day conference, held at the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans Abroad, called for encouraging the opening of cultural centers in China and Arab countries as part of the promotion of cultural, linguistic, religious, and ethnic diversity and the strengthening of cooperation between the two parties. This event, which is being held for the first time in Morocco and whose ninth conference will be organized in 2021 in China, reflects the depth of cultural and civilizational ties between Arab countries and China and highlights the invaluable contributions of the two sides to the development of civilizations.

Rabat – Morocco’s intelligence services have provided their Dutch counterparts with precise information that led to the arrest of Redouane Taghi, the leader of a mafia network in the Netherlands known as Mocro Maffia, in Dubai on Monday, December 16, according to the Dutch government. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) also gave the Netherlands information that led to the arrest of six other members of the mafia in several Dutch cities, said a spokesperson of the Dutch police, relays De Telegraaph. After Taghi’s arrest, Dutch police launched raids on private homes in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Vianen, and Huis ter Heide, and arrested five men and one woman, ranging in age from 29 to 45. The men are allegedly members of the mafia, and they are suspected of money laundering, weapon offences, and possession of hard drugs. According to Dutch media, the woman is Redouane Taghi’s sister. The Netherlands says that Taghi’s family plays an important role in his criminal organization. Police have already questioned two of his sisters, and two of his brothers are in jail in Morocco. On December 16, Emirati authorities arrested the mafia leader in Dubai, after receiving information about the fake identity he was using from the Netherlands. According to the Dutch police spokesperson, it was Morocco’s BCIJ that communicated Taghi’s new fake name and biometrics with their Dutch counterparts. Before the arrest, Dutch police suspected that Taghi was hiding in Morocco. BCIJ’s information, however, denied the suspicions and put the investigations back on the right track. Following Taghi’s arrest, Dutch officials transported him back to the Netherlands where he was wanted in relation to several murders. The Netherlands transferred the 41-year-old suspect on a private jet, under heavy protection, in case of a retaliation attack from the members of his mafia. The criminal mastermind is also a suspect in the Cafe La Creme shooting that happened in Marrakech in November 2017. Morocco suspects Taghi ordered the attack. On November 2, 2017, two Dutch members of Mocro Maffia opened fire at Cafe La Creme in Gueliz, Marrakech, before fleeing the scene on a large motorcycle. The attack targeted the cafe’s owner, Mustapha “Moes,” who was involved with the mafia’s drug operations and stole €27 million from Taghi. The shooting, however, killed a 26-year-old medical student and injured his classmate. BCIJ investigated Mocro Maffia after the attack, leading to the arrest of the two shooters and the two Taghi brothers, along with several other members. Mocro Maffia is the largest drug trafficking network in Europe, operating in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. In its early days, the mafia worked mainly on importing marijuana from Morocco’s Rif region into Europe. However, as it gained more notoriety, it arranged partnerships with South American drug cartels and started importing hard drugs such as cocaine. The criminal organization was involved in at least 87 murders in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, and Morocco. The mafia has also made organized attacks to threaten several news outlets including Panorama and De Telegraaf. While the arrest of Taghi is considered to be an important milestone in the fight against organized crime in the Netherlands, his right-hand man, Said Razzouki, is still on the loose. Dutch police advertised a bounty of €100,000 for anyone who could provide information leading to the arrest of the two criminals. Morocco’s contribution to apprehending one of the Netherlands’ and Europe’s most wanted criminals boosts its international reputation in security and threat prevention. In 2016, Morocco warned Germany before the Berlin attack that killed 11 people and injured 70. In 2018, Moroccan intelligence warned Germany again of a potential terror attack at the Stuttgart airport. A number of countries consider Morocco as a key partner in the fight against terrorism, including Spain, the US, Belgium, and France. Earlier this month, the chief prosecutor of Spain’s National Audience, Jesus Alonso, said, “Like Spain, France, and Belgium, Morocco is determined to eradicate this cross-border global phenomenon, which threatens the security and stability of the international community.”

It is a testament to Trump’s power of personality within the Republican Party that according to a recent Economist/YouGov poll a majority of Republicans (53%) say President Trump is a better president than Union savior and Civil War icon Abraham Lincoln, the very first Republican president. It is just the third time in US history that a president has been impeached by the full House; Andrew Johnson (1868) and Bill Clinton (1998) were both later acquitted during a senate trial. A two-thirds vote of the Senate (67 senators) is required to convict and remove the president from office. The Senate can also simply dismiss the charges after they are presented. The US Constitution sets the parameters of impeachment charges that can be pursued by Congress: “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Hence, impeachment is a process based as much in policy and politics as it is in criminal conduct enumerated in criminal code. President Trump’s actions this past spring and summer related to military aid to Ukraine and his stated desire for a Ukrainian government investigation into a domestic political rival (former Vice-President Joe Biden as well as his son) have led to two articles of impeachment: abuse of power by the executive (using his office for personal political gain) and obstruction of Congress (refusing to cooperate with Congress, its committees or its constitutionally-authorized investigative role). Public polling during the past month indicates a steady 45-50% of Americans support impeaching Trump and removing him from office. The results indicate a genuine split opinion on the impeachment issue that mirrors the partisan divide in the United States on several major policy issues. By comparison, as President Bill Clinton faced impeachment in the fall of 1998 his public approval rating was a robust 63%. Most Americans preferred that he only be censured by Congress for his misconduct. In August 1974, nearly one-third of fellow Republicans (31%) wanted Richard Nixon removed from office for the Watergate affair. Whether impeachment is a “partisan attempted coup” by Democrats or a historic abuse of power by the president the process will be debated in the Senate with live TV coverage. Legislating Continues While the impeachment drama unfolds, Congress and the Trump administration will move forward on major pieces of legislation that present bragging rights for both Democrats and Republicans, tentative bipartisanship seemingly operating in a parallel reality. Both the House and Senate have just passed an enormous nine-month spending package this week worth about $1.4 trillion that covers everything from border security to public health research on gun violence to food aid for low-income families. The House also just passed the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement, a top priority for Donald Trump as candidate and president. Labor protection related changes favored by Democrats were added to the trade agreement. Is the whole world watching? Casually, I’m sure. While visiting friends and colleagues in my former Peace Corps site in Errachidia Province a young Moroccan friend asked me if Americans are becoming fatigued by all the drama in Washington. A valid question. I told him that politics is a passion for many people especially in the age of social media. American allies, too, are facing profound political and social challenges of their own, from the ongoing Brexit saga in the United Kingdom to pension reform protests in France, among others. An observation from the 33rd President of the United States, Democrat Harry Truman, is relevant as both Democratic and Republican leaders—confident in their own arguments—move forward on the impeachment of the 45th president: “I never gave anybody hell! I just told the truth and they thought it was hell.”

Rabat – The US Senate has confirmed David Fischer as US ambassador to Morocco. Fischer’s confirmation on Thursday, December 19, comes after Morocco has been without a US ambassador for nearly three years. President Donald Trump nominated Fischer as ambassador to Morocco in November 2017, but the US Senate, which has to approve all presidential nominations for ambassadors, did not confirm Fischer until yesterday. After a time of consideration, the Senate confirmed Fischer’s nomination by a voice vote. David T. Fischer is a businessman from Michigan who owns a car sales business and contributed $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration fund. In August 2018, the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations began hearings on Fischer’s nomination. However, the Senate did not confirm the nominee. During the hearing, senators questioned Fischer about a lawsuit against his business and requested additional documentation from him. As a businessman, Fischer said during the August 2018 hearing that he would work “with the aim of widening the opportunities for [American] companies.” Morocco is the only country in Africa to share a Free Trade Agreement with the US. Fischer also highlighted Morocco as one of the US’s oldest allies in his previous hearing, saying the US-Morocco treaty is the “longest, unbroken treaty relationship in the United States’ history.” At the end of the Senate’s session, the legislative body had not set a date for further hearings and returned all pending nominations to the presidency, according to the Senate’s rules. President Trump renominated David Fischer in January 2019, and on November 20, the Senate agreed to consider Fischer’s nomination this month. The previous ambassador, Dwight Bush, served as the US ambassador to Morocco under President Barack Obama and announced his departure after President Trump’s election to office in 2016. Bush left Morocco in early 2017.

The historic votes capped a three-month inquiry by House Democrats into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. But the impeachment process is far from over: The proceedings now move to a trial in the Senate, which holds the final authority on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office, or to acquit him. The vote comes after months of investigations marked by explosive testimonies from a number of current and former White House employees. Lawmakers say Trump abused the power of the office of the president of the United States in his dealings with Ukraine by temporarily freezing nearly US$400 million in military aid. Officials allege the freeze was a bid to pressure the Ukrainian government to publicly announce separate investigations into purported interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election as well as former vice-president and political rival Joe Biden’s son Hunter‘s work on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. In a 650-page impeachment report released on Monday, investigators said Trump “betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.” Trump is now only the third president in the history of the United States to be impeached, joining Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

Rabat  – The Republic of El Salvador reiterated support for Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict on Thursday, December 18. Salvadoran Foreign Minister, Alexandra Hill spoke today about her country’s position in a press briefing in Rabat after talks with her Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita. She said that El Salvador underlines “the Moroccanness of the Sahara and reaffirms its support for the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of the kingdom of Morocco.” The Salvadoran official also reaffirmed the “final withdrawal” of her country’s recognition of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

We stop recognizing a country that does not exist, we strengthen our ties with the Kingdom of Morocco and we open the doors of the Arab world,” said El Salvador’s President in June. Several other countries withdrew recognition from the self-proclaimed group. The most recent moves came from Lesotho in Jamaica. Lesotho’s foreign minister, Lesego Makgothi, said on December 10 that any previous statements of support for the self-proclaimed SADR are “null and void.” On December 11, Jamaica has reiterated its decision to withdraw its recognition SADR. “We reiterate our support for the political process underway aimed at reaching a realistic and pragmatic solution,” Jamaica’s Minister Foreign Minister Kamina Johnson Smith said during her visit to Rabat.

Rabat – The municipal hygiene office of Agadir has allegedly rounded up the city’s stray dogs and placed them in an enclosure at the pound, without food. The dogs are eating each other to survive.  Disturbing videos filmed by animal welfare activists Lucy Austin and Fanny Belle claim to show the reality of the Agadir dog pound.  Warning: graphic content One video shows dogs gnawing at the open wounds of the corpses of dogs, already dead from starvation or fights.   Other videos show hordes of dogs viciously attacking one another in a desperate bid for something to eat.     In the videos, the dogs appear malnourished and visibly distressed.    A source close to the scene, who asked to remain anonymous, told Morocco World News that animal welfare associations based in Agadir have been trying to access the dog pound for months.  The source explained that she volunteers with Morocco Animal Aid. She visited the pound in August and saw that the dogs were very thin, and Morocco Animal Aid began feeding the dogs kibble to ease their starvation.  According to the source, the city’s sanitary office manages the pound. The office had been rounding up Agadir’s stray dogs and relocating them to the pound due to complaints from residents.  Morocco Animal Aid attempted to initiate a program to take care of the dogs, but the pound denied the group access to its facilities and enclosures.  The source says that the pound refused to answer any questions about who gave the order to round up the dogs and instructed the association to talk to the governor of the region.  The source revealed that her association’s attempts at communicating with the governor of Agadir have been futile.  The decision to publish a video of the brutal scene was a last resort, an attempt to prompt the pound to open avenues of communication with the association. “But they didn’t,” she lamented. “They just stopped us from accessing the dogs.” She added that Morocco Animal Aid gave the pound kibble for the dogs, but alleged that the employees never fed them.  “They just want them to die,” she stated.  Associations including Morocco Animal Aid, Ims’ONE, and Association Le couer sur la patte are working to feed and secure the starving dogs at the pound.  The news comes just days after local authorities allegedly authorized the slaughter of dozens of dogs on Tuesday, December 10 in Dar Bouazza, a coastal town near Casablanca. The community had already neutered and vaccinated the dogs, according to a Dar Bouazza resident, but the tags on their ears did not save them from the bullets.  Less than one month ago, Morocco’s Ministry of Interior signed an agreement with the agriculture and health sectors, along with the National Veterinarians Authority, to reduce Morocco’s stray dog population through sterilization rather than culling.  The initiative does not yet appear to have taken effect, and Morocco’s strays continue to suffer.  If you would like to contribute to animal welfare activism in Morocco, check out some of these organizations: Morocco Animal Aid  Ims’ONE Association Le couer sur la patte La Tribu des Quat’pattes SFT Animal Sanctuary ERHAM SPANA Association de Defense des Animaux et de la Nature (ADAN) L’association Mchichates

Rabat – The representatives of the Union members in the Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CESE) have unanimously elected Morocco’s Ahmed Reda Chami, as the new president of the Union of African Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions (UCESA). The election took place on Wednesday, December 18, in Rabat during the Union’s elective general assembly. Chami welcomed the trust of the representatives of the Union members in the CESE. The newly elected president will serve for the period of 2019-2021. “My first thought goes to my predecessor, President of the CES of Mali Boulkassoum Haidara, who had carried out his mandate with efficiency and insight over the past two years thanks to which the Union has succeeded in fostering its status among African international and regional institutions,” said Chami. Within the road map of the Moroccan mandate, Chami underlined priorities including the strengthening of the institutional and organizational mechanisms of the Union and the promotion of a system of reference and objectives for a social charter.  The priorities also include strengthening cooperation, broadening and better positioning the UCESA and bringing the theme of the impact of “climate change and the responses to be brought to the benefit of the African populations” by co-constructing a citizen-centered participatory approach. “Our ambition is to raise the Union’s contribution to the dynamics of improving the well-being of African citizens and to the sustainable development of the continent,” he stressed. Created in 2001, the UCESA brings together the economic and social councils of Africa and represents the continent on the board of directors of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions (AICESIS). The CESE provides advice on economic, social and environmental issues by carrying out studies and research at the request of the Government, the House of Representatives or the House of Councilors, or on its own initiative. On December 3, 2018, Chami succeeded to Nizar Baraka at the presidency of the CESE after King Mohammed VI appointed him to the post. Chami has an academic background. After studying at the Ecole Centrale Paris to graduate as an engineer and obtaining a master’s in management from John E. Anderson Graduate School Of Management, he then returned to Morocco to hold the post of General Director of Centrale Laitiere in North Africa from 1989 and 1991. After founding two enterprises, the former minister of industry and trade joined Microsoft where he pursued an 11-year-career and held several high-responsibility posts until 2004. Chami entered the Moroccan political scene in 2007 when he helped to set up the electoral program for the Party of Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP). Once the party joined the government coalition formed after the October 2007 elections, he was chosen a minister in the Abbas El Fassi government.

Rabat – The federal police office in Germany reportedly withheld information from Morocco’s intelligence services that could have prevented the 2016 Berlin attack from happening. German news outlet Der Tagesspiegel published an exclusive report this week, revealing that the information shared by Morocco led the federal police, or BKA, to new evidence, allowing them to take action against the perpetrator of the attack, Anis Amri. Anis Amri hijacked a vehicle, killing its driver. He subsequently drove the vehicle through the Breitscheidplatz Christmas market, killing at least 11 people.  Driving towards crowds, the perpetrator also wounded 70 people, some severely. The terrorist, originally from Tunisia, tried to escape, but the Italian police shot him. Today marks the fourth anniversary of the attack. According to the German news outlet, the state security officials at the Berlin State Police Pocoffice (LKA) discovered a few weeks after the attack that the BKA had withheld the information” provided by Morocco’s intelligence services before the attack. Traditionally, Morocco helps all of its partner countries by sharing information about potential terror attacks. Morocco’s intelligence services and counterterrorism units are considered among the most effective services in the world. The federal police failed to disclose information obtained from Morocco’s security services in autumn 2016. The news outlet said that in 2017 investigators in the Berlin case were “horrified” to know that the federal police had not given them information that could have been extremely important to investigate the case. Morocco also informed Germany that Amri was sharing a house in Berlin with a “Moroccan supporter of Jabhat al-Nusra,” an affiliate terror network of al-Qaeda. Moroccan law enforcement use intelligence services, police work, and collaboration with international partners to conduct successful counterterrorism operations.  In 2018,  Morocco’s intelligence services warned Germany of a potential terror attack at Stuttgart airport. Moroccan intelligence intercepted suspicious phone calls between two individuals about a future attack and immediately informed their German counterparts of their suspicions and the suspects’ names. A number of countries consider Morocco as a key partner in the fight against terrorism, including Spain, US, Belgium, and France. Earlier this month, chief prosecutor of Spain’s National Audience, Jesus Alonso said, “Like Spain, France and Belgium, Morocco is determined to eradicate this cross-border global phenomenon, which threatens the security and stability of the international community.”

Rabat – Morocco’s government has expressed full satisfaction with Comoros’ decision to open its general consulate in Laayoune, Western Sahara. Comoros officially opened the consulate headquarters on December 18, with an inauguration ceremony chaired by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, and his counterpart from Comoros, Souef Mohammed El Amine. Speaking to the press, Bourita announced that at least four more African countries aim to open consulates in Laayoune before the end of next year. Bourita announced that the city of Laayoune is set to host intense diplomatic activity during the coming months, including bilateral joint commissions between Morocco and its African partners and the Forum between Rabat and the Pacific countries. He said that the forum aims to convene business ministers from twelve countries. The minister also recalled Gambia’s decision to open a consulate in Dakhla. Morocco considers both Dakhla and Laayoune as part of its sovereign territories Bourita emphasized that the opening of the diplomatic representations in the southern provinces will “strengthen the vocation of the region as the gateway to Morocco on the African continent” in accordance with King Mohammed VI’s vision. He explained that the consulates will work to reinforce economic and commercial exchange and cooperation between Morocco and other African countries on the continent. Morocco’s position is non-negotiable  “The opening of the consulate is an event of great significance” as it reflects that, for Morocco, “the question of the Moroccaness of its Sahara is non-negotiable,” said Bourita. He also emphasized the exclusivity of the UN’s efforts as the only body in qualified to resolve the regional conflict. Bourita also argued that the consulate’s inauguration in the region constitutes the expression of the “strong” position and the constant support of the Union of the Comoros for Morocco’s position. “We are currently witnessing positive dynamics that would strengthen the Moroccan identity of the Sahara,” said Bourita, pointing out the “important developments” have taken place over the past ten days with regard to the Western Sahara conflict. Bourita also condemned the rumors spread by some parties about alleged hostile positions taken by certain members of the AU, as well as false rumors circulating about the new UN personal envoy. In the past few years, Morocco has been increasing its efforts and presence at the AU to avoid the “empty chair” issue that previously allowed pro-Polisario parties to oppose Morocco’s position on the conflict. For Bourita, another key event in recent weeks was Lesotho’s decision “to suspend all its previous decisions and statements relating to the Sahara and self-proclaimed SADR,” as well as that of “Jamaica which maintains its decision to withdraw recognition from the fake ‘SADR.’”

Rabat – Rabat and Moscow have concluded an agreement that will allow Russian companies to export beef to the Moroccan market. The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor announced that the two countries signed a veterinary certificate to supply Morocco with beef products, Russian news outlet Sputnik News reported. “Due to the results of the work carried out since 2016 between Rosselkhoznadzor and the competent body in Morocco, the procedure for access of Russian meat to the kingdom of Morocco is approved. The Moroccan side signed the veterinary certificate for supplies from Russia,” the statement said. The veterinary office emphasized that Russian companies have already “passed the inspection of Morocco’s veterinary service.” The exportation of Russian meat will start “right away.” Both Moscow and Rabat vowed to strengthen agricultural cooperation at their 7th session of the Moroccan-Russian Joint Cooperation Committee last year. The meeting of the joint cooperation convened Russian representatives with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhannouch.  Last year, Akhannouch said that agricultural products represent 77% of Moroccan exports to Russia. The products value is estimated at MAD 1.5 billion. Russia is also Morocco’s primary citrus export destination. The minister said that citrus fruits top agricultural exports, followed by other fruits and vegetables. In 2017-2018, the North African country’s exports of mandarin and tangerine totaled 205,091 metric tons to Russia and 166,299 metric tons to the EU. Since 2014, the growth of trade between the two countries is in the order of 10 %, Akhannouch added. Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said last year that trade between Russia and Morocco increased in the first half of 2018 to $900 million, or 20 % more than the same period of 2017. To boost agricultural cooperation, Morocco also lowered the grain tax to zero for Russia. The Russian ambassador to Morocco, Valerian Shuvaev, believes that the Moroccan decision will give Russia “more opportunity to increase the volume of deliveries and in general to expand our trade.” Morocco accepts beef import from US Russia is not the only country, which agreed to export its beef products to Morocco. Last year, the US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that Morocco “agreed to allow imports of US beef and beef products into Morocco.” “New access to the Moroccan market for beef and beef products is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports of U.S. agricultural products,” said Robert Lighthizer, the USTR’s representative. Moroccan imports of agricultural products from the US exceeded $512 million as of November last year, according to the USDA. The US forecasts that Morocco would represent an £80 million market for US beef and beef products. Morocco also agreed to authorise US poultry imports last year.

The annual event coincides with the day in 1973 that the UN General Assembly adopted Arabic as the sixth official language of the organization. “In the diversity of its forms, classic or dialectal, from oral expression to poetic calligraphy, the Arabic language has given rise to a fascinating aesthetic, in fields as varied as architecture, poetry, philosophy, and song. It gives access to an incredible variety of identities and beliefs and its history reveals the richness of its links with other languages,” says UNESCO’s website about the language. “Arabic has played a catalytic role in knowledge, promoting the dissemination of Greek and Roman sciences and philosophies to Renaissance Europe. It has enabled a dialogue of cultures along the silk roads, from the coast of India to the Horn of Africa,” adds the website.

Mohcine Jazouli, minister delegate to the minister of foreign affairs, said that Morocco’s “geostrategic” position and its notable presence in the African continent allow the North African country to play a “central role, as part of its cooperation with China.” China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Xiaodong, met with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita in June 2019.  Yesterday, December 17, Bourita lauded the Arab-Chinese partnership as a successful cooperation model during the opening of the 8th Conference on Arab-Chinese Relations and Dialogue between Arab and Chinese Civilizations.  The inclusion of Morocco in the BRI is an opportunity to “broaden horizons and multiply the opportunities for cooperation and investment between the two countries in several areas,” the minister said in a speech read on his behalf by Director for Asian Affairs and Oceania, Ambassador Abdelkader El Ansari. China’s Special Envoy for Middle East affairs, Zhai Jun, maintained that the BRI will consolidate and develop bilateral relations between China and Morocco.

Rabat – The European Union (EU)  has allocated a grant of €1.3 million the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), aiming to address malnutrition among Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. The WFP announced on December 17 that it welcomes the EU contribution, adding that the European organization supports the WFP nutrition activities. The WFP shared some alarming statistics about the rate of malnutrition among Sahrawis children and women. A recent survey by the WFP and the UNHCR found that the overall acute malnutrition rates among the Sahrawi children under five “reached 7.6 percent in 2019 compared to 4.6 percent in 2016.” The survey also found that “half of the children under five and half of women aged 15-49 suffer from anemia.” The EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid’s Head of office in Algeria, Patrick Barbier, said that the “increasing malnutrition trend in the Sahrawi refugee camps is worrying as it can lead to more deaths and disease.” The EU grant seeks to make “sure that refugee children and mothers are helped and spared unnecessary suffering. Sahrawi refugee families can continue to rely on the EU for vital humanitarian support,” he added. The joint statement from both the UNHCR and WFP echoes the concerns of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who spoke about the worrying statistics of malnutrition among Sahrawis in the camps. In October, the UN chief issued his annual report on the situation in Western Sahara, addressing the malnutrition crisis in the camps. In the fifth section, paragraph 63, Guterres said that malnutrition is one of the biggest concerns along with the prevalence of anemia. The UN official recalled that the UN organizations operating in the camps, including the UNHCR “, continued to work closely together on the treatment and prevention of anemia, stunting, and malnutrition among young children, girls, pregnant and lactating women.” The UN chief also warned that indicators studying malnutrition and anemia are a major concern. Guterres also cited in his report the same data that the WFP included on its press release about the EU contribution, emphasizing that “the results have shown a worsening situation compared with 2016.” Guterres touched on concerns shared by human rights organizations, including funding issues. According to the report, the “main challenge for humanitarian actors remained the funding shortfall.” A failure to address aid embezzlement  Despite warnings, the UN has failed to address the poor conditions that have led to that widespread disease and malnutrition in the camps. The embezzlement of humanitarian aid sent to Sahrawis in the camps in another issue in dire need of addressing. Several reports have exposed alleged embezzlement involving the Polisario Front and Algeria. Earlier this year, the president of the Canary Sahrawi Forum Miguel Angel Ortiz spoke about the embezzlement of aid and corruption in the camps in an opinion piece published by La Provincia. Ortiz warned that the camps experienced the “misappropriation of some  €2.5 million of humanitarian aid” from the international community destined for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps. Last year, Pro-Polisario news outlets Futuro Sahara reported that Sahrawis were surprised to find popular aid products on display in Algerian grocery shops.

Rabat – Moroccans spent more than than $44 million (MAD 424 million) on 662,586 Schengen visa applications in 2018. Nearly $8 million (MAD 77 million) of the total came from applicants whose visas had been denied. Of the 533,861 Moroccans who received Schengen visas in 2018, most applied for visas to France, followed by Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy.  The French consulates in Casablanca, Fez, and Rabat received the most Moroccan applications in 2018.   The new visa code Beginning on February 3, 2020, Schengen visa applicants will be subject to the new Schengen visa code. The new rules will include higher visa fees, an extended period for submitting applications, and electronic application options in most countries. Applicants will need to pay a fee of €80 (MAD 855) per application rather than the current rate of €60 (MAD 641). Applications for children aged seven and older will cost €40 (MAD 427) rather than €35 (MAD 374). Children six years old and younger will remain exempt from visa fees.  With the new regulations, Schengen visa applicants will also be able to file an application six months before their intended trip to the Schengen area as opposed to the current period of three months. The latest that an application can be submitted is two weeks before an applicant’s intended trip.  The new visa code will also require the representative authorities of every Schengen member state to be present in every ‘third country,’ or developing country, with regard to visa admission.  If a Schengen member state does not have representatives in a specific developing country, the Schengen member must outsource visa admission to another Schengen country or visa processing service center. Consequently, visa applicants will no longer need to travel to another country just to file an application.  Additionally, frequent travelers who have already received visas can benefit from valid visas for a longer period of time.  The new code will also introduce a mechanism to assess whether visa fees should change or remain the same every three years. Additionally, the EU will begin penalizing countries that refuse to cooperate on the readmission of irregular migrants with visa restrictions.  The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, adopted the new regulations in June 2019. The updated visa code aims to strengthen the common visa while addressing migration and security concerns.  What is the Schengen visa? The Schengen visa is a short-stay visa that allows its holder to travel to 26 European countries known as Schengen states. 22 of these countries are in the EU.  The 26 member states make up the Schengen Area, named for the 1985 Schengen Agreement that abolished all passport and border control at the member states’ mutual borders.  The Schengen Area amasses more than four million square kilometers and operates as a single jurisdiction for international travelers.  Travelers from 104 countries and entities need to obtain a visa to enter the Schengen Area for up to three months.  The Schengen visa is one of the world’s most sought-after visas. The consulates of the 26 Schengen member states received more than 16 million applications in 2018.

Rabat – The US Congress has approved a draft bill with a section on Morocco that includes Western Sahara, an overtly pro-Morocco move set to pour some cold water on mounting suggestions that US-Morocco relations are not as strong as the two allies officially claim. Adopted yesterday, the draft which was obtained by Morocco World News is a massive, $1.4 trillion omnibus bill packaging provisions for the State Department for fiscal year 2020. It makes “appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes,” according to the US House of Representatives. Covering US assistance funds to Morocco in part (h) of the section on the Middle East and North Africa, the bill adopts a clearly pro-Morocco tone by including Western Sahara in the US’ financial provisions for Rabat. “‘Development Assistance’ and ‘Economic Support Fund’ in this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara: Provided, That not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act and prior to the obligation of such funds, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the USAID Administrator, shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the proposed uses of such funds,” reads part of the draft’s Morocco section. The inclusion of Western Sahara in the Morocco section points to an implicit drift towards Rabat’s claims on the disputed territory, a validation of the warm ties between Rabat and Washington, despite reports of some low points in the bilateral alliance. The language and tone of the draft bill echoe that of the 2019 spending bill, with both the US Senate and President Trump last year green lighting a sweeping spending bill whose language was also supportive of the Moroccan position. On that occasion, the Moroccan foreign ministry expressed satisfaction with a bill it said evinced an unmistakable pro-Morocco feel. One notable difference from last year’s spending bill, however, has to do with the case of the Tindouf camps. There is no mention of the distressed Sahrawis in the Polisario-run camps in the Congress’ draft bill, whereas last year’s spending bill included a paragraph that spoke of “vulnerable refuges in North Africa,” alluding to the Tindouf camp residents. The paragraph called for more coordinated actions from US and UN officials to monitor food and financial assistance for the residents of the Tindouf camps, an implicit condemnation of the Polisario leadership’s reported embezzlement and mismanagement humanitarian assistance for the Sahrawis in Tindouf. But congressional stamp is only the beginning of a much longer, arduous legislative process. As the proposed draft is still to go through senatorial and presidential approvals, it remains to be seen what the final version of the bill will look like and whether the Senate may consider adding the paragraph on the conditions in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Given the direction the US-Morocco has been taking in recent months, however, a complete reversal—in language or principle— of the congress’ proposed draft is highly unlikely. In the meantime, the Congress’ move comes at a charged time for US-Morocco relations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently visited Morocco, and the episode has been touted by both Moroccan and US officials as one of the clearest embodiments of the strength and strategic depth of the “strategic relationship” between the two allies. Morocco is widely acknowledged as one of the strongest US allies in the MENA region. But while Rabat does greatly value its partnership with its American ally, there is a feeling in Morocco that Washington has not been as supportive as it should be on some issues of the utmost importance for Moroccan interests, including explicit support for Morocco’s territorial claims on Western Sahara. Even as it silently laments a lack of decisive US support for its Western Sahara position, however, Rabat is understood to pin its hopes on the fact that the proliferation of symbolic pro-Morocco calls from Washington—visits of senior, key faces of the administration, as well as friendly legislative moves—are good omens for the long term.

The speaker of the Lower House in Gabon also reiterated support for Morocco’s return to the African Union. “Morocco assumes a major role in Africa and without the kingdom, African action cannot succeed.” In recent years, Africa has become a staple in royal speeches, with King Mohammed VI repeatedly reaffirming Morocco’s commitment to the continent’s development through south-south cooperation. “Ever since I ascended the throne, I have put Africa at the heart of Morocco’s foreign policy. Therefore, I have paid visits to numerous African countries, and close to 1,000 agreements have been signed, covering all areas of cooperation,” said the King on his 2019 Green March speech in November. The monarch added that “this has had a tangible impact on Morocco’s economic, political, cultural, and religious standing on the continent,” reaffirming his determination to make Morocco a key player in “shaping the Africa of the future.” The Gabonese official expressed the will of his country to “consolidate economic and commercial cooperation with Morocco and to intensify the exchange of experiences and expertise in the ecological and parliamentary fields.” During a meeting between Boukoubi and Morocco’s head of government, El Othmani  expressed satisfaction with Gabon’s “constant support from the friendly Gabonese Republic, expressing the will of the Moroccan government to strive for enhanced bilateral relations at all levels and broadening their fields within the framework of a distinguished partnership.” Strong alliance King Mohammed VI and Ali Bongo Ondimba, son of Omar Bongo and current President of Gabon share strong friendship. In 2017, the Gabonese president shared a picture of him and King Mohammed VI as teenagers, demonstrating the long-standing friendship between them. Last year in November, Bongo was hospitalized in Saudi Arabia. He spent nearly a month at King Faisal hospital in the Saudi capital following a stroke on October 24. The Gabonese president arrived in Rabat on November 29 to continue his convalescence in Morocco at the request of the King. In an op-ed published by Oxford Business Group, said that “there is a remarkable strategic partnership between Gabon and the Kingdom of Morocco.” “These strong ties were patiently built by our illustrious predecessors, to whom I would like to pay respect. The success of this special relationship calls for a moment of reflection on the strength and diversity of our many connections, and the various areas of common interest,” he added.

Rabat – Morocco is set to host the 2019 All African Students and Youth Summit (ASYS 2019), described as the biggest student rally on the African continent. The event, scheduled from December 20-23, will take place at the Moulay Rachid national sports center in Sale, near Rabat. The three-day event sets out to celebrate African cooperation in the fields of education and scientific research, and is expected to gather over 1000 participants from 50 African countries, according to the organizers. Organized “under the high patronage” of King Mohammed VI, indicates a statement from the organizers, the continental event seeks to discuss the numerous challenges facing young Africans. The event’s theme “The Future of Africa: Challenges and Perspectives for African Youth,” is an echo to King Mohammed VI’s insistence on the centrality of youth in any inclusive and functional development model. This makes Morocco, according to organizers, a fitting venue for the ambitions of this year’s ASYS meeting. Attendance will include sub-Saharan students enrolled at Moroccan universities, African student organizations in Morocco and from across the continent, Moroccan ministers and a number of their continental counterparts, notably from the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal, as well as civil society organizations and education-focused Moroccan and international groups. The event comes as Morocco multiples steps to capitalize on its increasing continental prominence, with Rabat using such events to stretch its diplomatic and organizational muscles in African circles. The Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), a co-organizer of the event in partnership with the Moroccan foreign affairs ministry, which is the main driver  of the North African kingdom’s education-based soft power on the continent, has been instrumental in making Morocco a sought-after destination for higher education and vocational training. Africa is at the center of Morocco’s diplomacy, AMCI President Mohammed Methqal explained recently, describing the agency’s program of scholarships and study grants as designed to shape “Africa’s future leaders.” There are currently 10,000 African students at Moroccan universities, and AMCI plans to receive and fund the training of more students from the continent in the coming years.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia has stripped journalist and public figure Abdelhamid al-Ghabin of his citizenship for “normalization and cooperation with Israel.” The journalist confirmed the news on his Twitter, saying that the reports of his loss of citizenship are true after a “ministerial decision.” He claimed that he does not know the reasons behind the decision. ما نشر عن سحب الجنسية صحيح وبقرار وزاري ولا أعرف الأسباب !
وأنا أحترم القرار بغض النظر عن حيثياته وليس لنا إلا السمع والطاعة.#عبدالحميد_الغبين — #عبدالحميد الغبين (@Abdullhameeds) December 16, 2019  “I respect the decision regardless of its reasons,” he added. The journalist, who is also a political analyst, has been making controversial pro-Israeli statements. Earlier this year, the Saudi public figure said that there are not many Palestinians in Saudi Arabia and that Saudis refuse to deal with them. He added that Saudis would prefer to work with Israelis instead. El Ghabin claimed that Saudi Arabia wants peace and stability, but some “Palestinian parties don’t want peace, like Hamas.” He argued that after 20 years, “there will be overall peace” between Arab countries and Israel. “Should we make 500,000,000 Arabs homeless for 7 million Palestinians who reject all solutions?” he asked. He added that all Arab countries have been “ruined because of the Palestinian cause.” El Ghabin is not the only Saudi public figure, to cause backlash for his pro-Israeli statements. Saudi blogger Mohamed Saud has been stirring controversy through his videos, where he expresses love for Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, the blogger shared a video, expressing his wish to visit Israel. “Hello everyone, I am Mohammed Saud and I am from Saudi Arabia, I love Israel,” he said. In July, Palestinians kicked the blogger off the Al Aqsa compound in occupied East Jerusalem. Several videos posted online show Palestinians insulting him and accusing him of being a traitor and a zionist.  The blogger was part of a six-member Arab delegation of journalists hosted by the Israeli foreign ministry in an Israeli -sponsored trip.

Washington D.C – The incapacity of the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs to arrange so far for a Royal visit to President Trump’s White House exposes the limits of Morocco’s lobbying efforts in Washington. Rabat remains too afraid or uneasy to engage with the current American administration. The Moroccan public clearly views a Royal visit to the White House as high diplomatic achievement, an endorsement of Rabat’s policy in the region and a recognition of its weight and importance to Washington.  The inability of Moroccan officials to secure such trip speaks volume about the fundamental shortcomings of Morocco’s diplomatic and lobbying efforts in Washington and the need for a fundamental change in the way Rabat conducts business in the American capital. The Moroccan administration seems devoid of a strategy on how to approach the Trump administration or seized the occasion to establish momentum and create high-level dialogue at the head of state level.  In fact, it continues to rely on lobbyists to do the diplomatic work while depicting American representatives, such as Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner’s casual visits as signs of a healthy relationship between the two capitals. There have been some l “uncertainties” in the relationship following the allegations that Morocco pledged $12 million to the “Clinton Foundation” before the 2016 U.S presidential elections. While observers in both capitals agree that this “incident’ has no bearing on today’s relations, Rabat remains anxious, confused and unsure on how to proceed. It never got over its initial apprehension and bafflement after the election of Mr. Trump. Furthermore, three years after the elections, Moroccan officials in charge of managing and handling the lobbying and diplomatic efforts in Washington are still perplexed by the ad hoc nature of Trump’s foreign policy. In effect, the modesty of Morocco’s ambitions and the dithering of some of its diplomats are behind Rabat’s ineffectiveness in Washington. While Morocco was never on Trump’s radar, a royal visit to the White House would have created chemistry, and established a comfortable relationship between the two heads of states leading to better and stronger ties.  Under President Trump, the United States foreign policy has been based more on personalities and less on alliances and historic relations. Thus, a King Mohammed VI trip is key to the strengthening and developments of the current American-Moroccan relations. Trump’s unorthodox diplomacy opens the door for Morocco to secure Washington’s blessing and support in Western Sahara at a critical time. With both Algiers and Madrid, two key players and Morocco’s foes in the conflict marred in political quagmires for months to come, Rabat has had the perfect political environment to win Trump’s support. Unfortunately, the ineffectiveness of Moroccan diplomats in some key capitals and the absence of a strong Moroccan diplomatic strategy hinder the development and implantation of an effective diplomacy that would exploit the present politico-diplomatic tide in Washington to garner an explicit international endorsement and support for Morocco’s policy in Western Sahara. Morocco is in dire need of diplomats who understand the evolution of lobbying under a fast-shifting Trump White House. The old way of hiring retired lawmakers and former State Department officials to lobby is no longer the game in Washington. All it takes to change American foreign policy nowadays is an audience with the President of the United States. This new approach should be good news for Moroccans officials struggling to secure a State Department endorsement of Morocco’s Local Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara. In the past, they were compelled to chase bureaucrats and diplomats around Foggy Bottom when trying to sell their policy. Not anymore. In fact, Trump is the perfect president to issue a new directive on Western Sahara, if Morocco could play its cards right. However, Rabat is still scrambling to adjust to this “new” reality. Despite spending an important amount of money on lobbying efforts, the Kingdom remains without a clear and effective strategy to advance its interests in DC. Are Moroccan diplomats and their lobbying partners in DC up to the job is obviously a pertinent question to ask on the eve of the American presidential campaign session.  Morocco will remain a natural partner and reliable ally of the U.S.  in the Middle East and Africa. Nevertheless, while there is an intensified dialogue between the military establishments of the two countries, the political dialogue has remained feeble albeit cordial. Whereas Morocco’s Foreign Minister met his counterpart in Washington several times, it took three years for a U.S. Secretary of State to visit the Kingdom. Still, Rabat should capitalize on the momentum created by Pompeo’s stopover. It is clear from the Secretary of State’s schedule that the United States values Morocco’s anti-terrorism efforts and King’s Mohammed VI influence in Middle East conflicts. It is now on the Royal advisers and the ministry of foreign affairs to draw a strategy to expand on these “key subjects” hoping to advance Morocco’s agenda in Washington.  The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – After purchasing the Bombardier plant in Casablanca, American aerospace company Spirit Aerosystems has announced the expansion of its Moroccan factory as well as the development of an ecosystem in the country, said the ministry in a statement. The factory will see its 10,000 square meters area expanded to 25,000 square meters as well as increasing its workforce from 350 to 850 employees. The announcement came following a meeting in Rabat on Monday, December 16, between Morocco’s minister of industry, trade, and green economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy and the Executive VP and Senior VP of Spirit AeroSystems. The meeting resulted in the two sides agreeing to set up a joint team to establish an ecosystem in Morocco to develop new aeronautics activities and maximize local integration of the aerospace giant. On October 2019, Spirit Aerosystems signed a purchase agreement to acquire three plants of Bombardier in Casablanca, Belfast, and Dallas. The acquisition is set to be finalized by the first semester of 2020. Through the extension, the American giant aims to develop its activities with Airbus, to continue to serve Boeing, and strengthen its industrial footprint to remain the market leader.

The academy awarded the prize to Lahjomri in honor of his contributions to the promotion of the French language, institutions, and valuable research. Praised by King Mohammed VI, Lahjomri is recognized for “his efforts as the head of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco; enshrining the values of dialogue, living-together and the understanding between cultures and civilizations.” Lahjormi told MAP after the ceremony that he dedicates his award to the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco and to “all the teachers, all the deans and all the university rectors who are currently working in the context of educational reform, which would be an important reform within the framework of the modernization of Morocco.” The French Academy honors 40 members, naming them as guardians of the French language. Lahjomri is now one of those members as Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco.

Rabat – Li Li, China’s ambassador to Morocco, does not seem to mind all the fuss about the “Chinese miracle,” the catchy description economists and political commentators often use to refer to the spectacular economic growth and structural changes the Asian giant has seen in recent decades. When you ask Ambassador Li about China’s eye-catching rise in global prominence and what lessons other developing countries can take from such a heartwarming success story, you get what you almost always get from China on questions like modernity or globalization: An unrepentant belief in the now increasingly invoked precept that “one size does not fit all.” “As China’s ambassador to Morocco,” he told Morocco World News at a book launch in Rabat last week, “I really tend to distance myself from giving in to this assuming attitude that contends that Morocco has a lot to learn from China.” He continued by pointing to the efforts Morocco has made in recent years to bring political reforms and effective policies that could put the North African kingdom on track to materialize the “royal vision” of inclusive development. “I have to admit I have been a firsthand witness to Morocco’s development during my time here as China’s ambassador,” he stressed. These comments, taken straight from China’s “no strings attached” and “equal partnership” playbook when dealing with other countries, especially those from the developing world, came on December 10, as Ambassador Li participated in the launching of the Arabic translation of President Xi Jinping’s book, “The Governance of China.” At the event, the ambassador spoke pointedly about the role of culture and history in the socio-economic outcome of a country. But mostly, of course, he spoke about the “historic” relationship between Morocco and China and how to make the two nations’ “multifaceted” and “wide-ranging” friendship even stronger. Adorning his speech with Chinese historical and cultural references, he cited President Jinping and—inevitably— channeled lots of Confucius quotes to hammer home his belief in culture and history being essential in driving a country’s development. ‘Harmonious globalization’ During the book launch, there was a procession of approving nods and whispers of agreement from the audience as Ambassador Li spoke of improving the cultural cooperation between Rabat and Beijing. The event’s guests and speakers, including Fathallah Oualalou, author and former economy minister of Morocco, made the same points as Ambassador Li when speaking about the “remarkable Chinese miracle” in the past five or six decades and what this could mean for China-Morocco and China-Africa in a global context marked by the inevitability of China’s global hegemony. “For me, while China has made immense progress in recent years, two things have really stood out: the depth of the country’s economic model, and the launching of the Belt and the Road Initiative,” Oualalou said. The Moroccan economist did not only speak from his experience dealing with China as Morocco’s economy minister. Author of an acclaimed book on China’s economic rise and political “indispensability” in our era of “multipolar or a-polar” globalization, Oualalou made it clear that he was speaking from the perspective of an economist who has done his homework in understanding why China’s global leadership ambitions are unstoppable and whether—or how—other developing countries should seek inspiration from the Chinese development model. Chiming in, other guests—Moroccans and Chinese—came up with similar points, all puncturing the need to upgrade and strengthen China-Morocco ties. “Win-win,” “equitable exchanges,” and “coincidence of wants” were among the working concepts that every other speaker at the event seemed to agree on, although there was also an unarticulated agreement that Morocco actually has more to learn from China than the other way around. Ambassador Li, for his part, seemed firmly invested in avoiding anything that could have easily been interpreted as patronizing. “Morocco has incredible potential. And we [the Chinese government] have always been driven by the ambition to go as far as possible, and why not in Morocco, to learn more about the world and nourish our national aspirations,” he told MWN. Does that mean that Morocco, too, could teach China about development? It’s always a two-way street business, the ambassador argued, by which he meant that both countries can and should learn from their cooperation. “I really believe that in cooperating with Morocco, all we should do is share with our Moroccan friends our experience with economic development. But the choice of which Chinese experience to try or emulate is ultimately up to Morocco. The Chinese will never teach, never.” His rhetoric evinced the sprinkles of self-awareness of a voice from a “developing country” (It’s curious that China is still described as such) who knows what most people in the “Global South” abhor: the self-appointed lesson givers from “developed” or “more economically advanced” countries whose political successes have filled them with the self-righteous pretentiousness of having the responsibility to drag poorer countries from the abyss of poverty and failed policies. At the risk of sounding didactic and self-absorbed, Ambassador Li was unimpeachably diplomatic and measured when speaking of China’s “economic miracle”—and it is worth mentioning that he detests that description—and its significance for scores of other developing countries setting out to improve their economic performance. Ambassador Li Li’s principled abhorrence of the inherent condescension of richer countries is commendable in many regards. But the problem with such measured, heavily balanced, and unassailable self-conscious rhetoric is that one never gets to the heart of the speaker’s politics, or profound convictions. Is it a performance? What, for instance, is Morocco’s place in China’s African ambitions? Does Rabat’s growing continental assertiveness make it central in China’s plans for Africa, I asked Ambassador Li, desperately directing my questions in order to get bolder, less self-aware answers. In response, there was a short, longish pause, littered with a series of bearably long sighs. There was—again—a measured silence, the “are-you-serious-right-now” kind of composure of those with unshakable belief in the veracity or wisdom of what they are about to say. And then came the actual (spoken) answer, confident, serene, and almost erudite. “I hate saying that this or that country is central for China. When it comes to economic cooperation between countries, the norms are always dictated by the market, by companies which are actually the ones that drive and sustain the cooperation. “So the market decides. But I should add that I trust Morocco’s economic potential, because not only is this country, like China, politically stable and economically open to the world, I see here a remarkable willingness to cooperate with other countries. So I think Morocco and China can become central for each other and develop relations where we learn from each others’ experiences.” While this felt like a continuation of what Ambassador Li said during the book launch minutes earlier, it was encouraging enough that he was at least willing to argue, make a more detailed, bolder case for the bullet-points-like recital he had offered earlier. In some ways, it helped perhaps that Ambassador Li’s response was a fitting summary of what China has been advocating for as an increasingly global player. Having weathered the storms of Cold War era bipolarization and post-Cold War unipolarization, Fathallah Oualalou wrote in the introduction to his book on China’s rise, “China is offering a kind of harmonious globalization, which implies the equal participation and involvement of all countries in global exchanges. The point is that no individual culture or country should feel entitled to run the world.” In our interview, Ambassador gave more flesh to the “harmonious globalization” argument. “With the level of stability and tolerance that Morocco offers, coupled with the country’s burning desire to go forward, I think we can work out a kind of cooperation where there is enough oxygen for both countries [Morocco and China] to learn,” he argued, speaking with the vigor of a new convert. Inspiration, not duplication Of development and “economic miracle,” Ambassador Li offered no fanciful theories. However, not content to limit himself to constantly shrugging off the notion that other developing countries could learn from China, he spoke about why such an attitude—China teaching others what works best for them—would be catastrophic for both China and the countries it would pretend to teach. While this would make China condescending, it would deprive the recipient countries from an inescapable element on the road to development: The right to make mistakes while finding one’s own way. For the ambassador, China’s success is not an invitation for others to be like the Asian giant, or duplicate what worked for China. Rather, a close inspection of China’s rise—both the history of successive dynasties that ruled it  and the arduous, mistakes-laden path that it took in the last century—should be a telling reminder that every country is duty-bound to find within its own political and social traditions what is best for its social needs and economic aspirations. The “Chinese way,” as some commentators have dubbed China’s model, is neither self-perpetuating nor miraculous, Ambassador Li suggested. It should therefore not be taken for granted by those who admire its effectiveness, nor should they try to emulate it regardless of their own social and political realities. The argument is well-established among China-Africa scholars. Even in its engagement on the security front in Africa, writes Abdou Rahim Lema, a Yenching Scholar at Peking University focusing on China-Africa security, Beijing, unlike Western partners who usually come to the continent with ready-made policies, instant panacea to Africa’s problems, has opted for “African solutions to African problems.” Ambassador Li agrees, at least in spirit. China’s sudden development after decades of failed or less successful attempts, according to him, is perhaps the most striking indication that change does not occur, nor does national wealth accumulate magically, courtesy of some foreign generosity. Rather, it is painfully, diligently achieved. It takes sustained effort, immense investment, incredible political will, and—perhaps more importantly—a certain degree of comfort with making mistakes. As any successful individual would attest, the ambassador seemed to contend, success is the child of countless failures. And so, only after many ill-conceived, sometimes calamitous policies, can a country ultimately hit the start button that eventually unleashes the hitherto dormant potential to devise the policies that finally work. The process is as vital as the outcome is gratifying. Development, in the ambassador’s analysis, is a coming-of-age story, a journey of maturity and learning. It’s about resilience, adaptation, last-ditch adjustments, and reorganization. It’s not about hoping for the miracle to happen. It’s about setting out to make the miracle happen, to achieve the unprecedented. This all the while knowing that the horrendous and immeasurably horrific may occur before the coveted miracle finally presents itself. Here, political vision and ambition are essential; but they are not enough. It also takes guts to admit that while change can—and will— hurt, it is worth the try and the sacrifices. What, exactly, does that say of Morocco’s recently launched, much-reported new development model? Here, Ambassador Li allowed himself a relatively fawning praise for Morocco’s recent policies. In a calm, unassuming voice, he gave due credit to the North African kingdom’s recent reforms and perceived willingness to be a force to reckon with in global dialogues. But, even while highlighting the undeniable merits of Morocco’s reforms, Ambassador Li drifted back to his earlier points about the need for Moroccan policymakers not to give in to the fashionable idea of “importing” success stories. It does not benefit Morocco, he insisted, to attempt to be another China, or Africa’s China. It is enough to be a better Morocco, investing in becoming more economically advanced and brighter on many other fronts, including education and scientific innovation, but never altering its cultural specificities and underlying political culture. This means the whole point of economic development—yet again—is not to mindlessly emulate what has worked elsewhere in the hopes that it would work here. The point is to get inspiration from others in order to devise your own way, what works for you. “I understand that Moroccans like to say that Chinese are hardworking and diligent people. But these [diligence and hard work] are fundamental virtues for development and the kinds of aspirations that Morocco is now nourishing. “Some years ago, the consensus was that China was the world’s factory. Now there is a growing sense that China is becoming the world’s market. This means that China’s policy of opening to the world has paid noticeable dividends. With Morocco’s new development model under the impulsion of the King [Mohammed VI], a similar experience is possible here,” he said.

Rabat – Spanish company Gil Comes, operating in the new port of Larache, northern Morocco, “exploits outrageously the women working” there, according to the International Labor Network of Solidarity and Struggle. The network, regrouping more than 40 labor unions and federations from different countries, including the Moroccan Labor Union (UMT), published a statement denouncing working conditions at the Spanish company, on Thursday, December 12. Gil Comes employs more than 2,000 Moroccan women in its factory for freezing fish and seafood. The employees work in “conditions that seriously harm their health” and receive “poor wages,” according to the labor network. The statement indicates that there is no medical department in the workplace. It also sheds light on the lack of a work safety committee,  violating the Moroccan labor code. Morocco’s Democratic Organization for Labor (ODT) has been calling for a strike at the company’s workshop since the start of the year. Workers went on strike on October 17, and are still striking. ODT accuses the company of “arbitrary dismissals and unfair transfers.” The company has fired around 100 employees, including 5 unionists with more than 12 years of seniority, according to the organization. The union also denounces the “repression, intimidation, threats, psychological harassment, and the systematic persecution against ODT’s unionists.” Spain’s General Confederation for Labor (CGT), the third-largest Spanish labor union, has also denounced the company’s abuse of Moroccan female workers. The confederation called on the Moroccan government to stop “the impunity” from which they say Gil Comes benefits and to negotiate collective conventions to preserve the workers’ rights. The Spanish company, however, told the press that the accusations against it are false and that they are suffering from “harassment on social media.” There have only been “5 or 6 firings for serious misconduct” in the last year, according to the human resources manager of the company. The company’s spokesperson also affirmed that all sanitary rules within the workplace are respected and that the company is “open for dialogue, although ODT did not present any proof of their accusations.”

Rabat – Researchers in the Arab region are convinced that the only solution to the many obstacles they face is to leave. In an online survey conducted by Al- Fanar Media, 91% of the 650 researchers who participated admitted that they would like to work elsewhere. Nearly all of the respondents said that they would leave their home country for a research post abroad. The participants said that the lack of funding is the primary reason for the yearning to emigrate. According to the survey, 84% of researchers said that they have to use their own funding for their research. Moreover, access to research is limited as almost half of the researchers said they do not have an internet connection at home labs, conferences and opportunities to collaborate internationally are limited, and they do not have free access to academic journals. Not only is funding an issue, but gaining permission for research from institutions or the government is nearly impossible to achieve in a timely manner. Social researchers also revealed that it could take months or years to get research approved by the government. Mefi Alrasheedi, an assistant professor of business administration at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia said in the survey: “Administrative work drains the academic’s time and takes them away from their research work, especially work of a complex nature, amid a lack of sufficiently qualified human resources.” Even when researchers do get approval from institutions or the government, their exploration is overseen. Forty-three% of the surveyed researchers noted that corruption, lack of administrative support, and bureaucracy control their creative thinking and diminishes their academic freedom. In trying to win a promotion to improve salaries, some participants complained that more and more researchers in the Arab region try to increase the number of studies published rather than focusing on the quality of their research. Adding to that issue, 55% of participants responded that women face a particularly challenging course in becoming as successful as male researchers in Arab countries. Rana Dajani, a molecular biologist, said in the survey: “Many are stuck inside a loop of wanting to be promoted and getting a better salary, and that’s it. The objective becomes promotion, not doing science, so they do the bare minimum to get promoted.” The idea of researchers emigrating does not sit well among Arab countries that want to build “knowledge economies” or instill a competitive atmosphere between universities, says Abdelhamid Nechad, an economist at the Higher School of Commerce and Business in Casablanca in response to the survey. The survey concluded that any researcher with a good idea and devotion to science itself will emigrate West instead. Morocco is no exception According to a report conducted by the Moroccan National Council in 2018, “underpayment and difficult working conditions are the factors making more and more Moroccan doctors consider emigration.” In the same study, an anonymous Moroccan doctor complained about the feeling that his profession is not respected in Morocco by stating, “For those who do not have the means to open a private office or find a job in the private sector, going to France or Germany remains the only way to ensure a guaranteed future.” In seeking professional respect, most Moroccan professionals emigrate to France, says the Arab Weekly. The report adds that every year, thousands of doctors and engineers emigrate in the hopes of finding a place that provides better living conditions, social status, and the academic rights that are lacking in Morocco. In a report recently released by Mercer, the world’s largest human resources consulting firm, the main cause of stress for Moroccan employees is the lack of financial and social security. Around 84% of employees said that a retirement plan is necessary, and 66% would like to change their job for a better salary. Income is the main reason for deciding to stay in the same city or look for opportunities elsewhere for 43% of employees. Additionally, Said Amzazi, Morocco’s Minister of Education, said that educated people also leave because of technological transformations and the appeal of international laboratories. He acknowledged that Morocco does not provide incentives to attract educated Moroccans across the world. In response to the latest survey, Nechad said that the Kingdom itself “should raise the salaries of researchers and offer them more career opportunities.”

Rabat – Moroccan police aborted an irregular migration attempt in the north-eastern city of Nador on Monday evening, December 16. Police arrested 25 sub-Saharan would-be undocumented migrants, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement. Security services also arrested the main suspect, who organizes irregular migration operations. Police had previously put out a warrant for the suspect, the statement added. During the operation, police seized vests and inner tubes. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation to arrest all accomplices involved. The police conducted the operation on the same day that security services rescued 70 sub-Saharan nationals who were on board an inflatable boat carrying around 94 irregular migrants from sub-Saharan countries. The operation took place early Monday, December 16 off Nador’s coast after the boat capsized. Seventeen people are still missing. Yesterday’s raid is part of Morocco’s approach to fight against undocumented migration. Morocco is both a transit and home for sub-Saharan migrants and refugees who wanted to settle in the North African country. The Moroccan government said in August that Moroccan authorities aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. In  2013, Morocco adopted a migratory policy seeking to address the issue of migration in accordance with human rights standards. Migrants, who refuse to go back to their countries of origin, also have the opportunity to regularize their status. According to the Director of Migration and Border Surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali, “85% of the requests for regularization of stay have been accepted.” In his speeches, including a message to the African Union (AU) Summit in 2018, King Mohammed VI said that migration should be seen as a “natural phenomenon” and should be celebrated. “We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity,” said the King.

Rabat – The vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in charge of the bank’s activities in Morocco, Emma Navarro, signed new agreements with Morocco to fund strategic projects in Morocco on Friday, December 13. During her official visit to Morocco, Navarro approved a total of €401.5 million funding to develop renewable energy projects, modernizing infrastructures for tap water, and supporting the private sector. In the sector of renewable energies, the EIB signed a funding agreement with Morocco’s Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) on Saturday, December 14. The funding of €129 million concerns the construction of 7 photovoltaic power plants with a total installed power of 200 MW in eastern and southern Morocco at the Noor Atlas projects. EIB will finance technical assistance as part of its Economic Resilience Initiative to oversee the implementation of the Noor Atlas projects The Economic Resilience Initiative is upgrading social and economic infrastructure and stimulating private-sector growth and job creation. The project is part of the national energy strategy that aims to ensure electricity supply and improving the quality of service provided for remote areas. The two institutions inked a second funding agreement of €37.5 million to secure and improve the supply of drinking water to small and medium-sized Moroccan urban agglomerations. The aim is to increase the resilience of the towns to the effects of climate change and improve the performance of drinking water supply facilities. The new funding brings the total amount of the financial partnership between the ONEE and the EIB to nearly €2 billion. For the water sector alone, the EIB has allocated around €366.5 million euros for the implementation of 9 drinking water and sanitation projects.  The vice-president also approved an envelope of €235 million mainly dedicated to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and mid-cap companies in the bio-economy field.  The bio-economy field involves key sectors including energy, transport, water and sanitation, education, health, social housing, industry, business support, and innovation. Developing the sector is crucial for Morocco both in terms of growth and food security, with a long-awaited socio-economic impact in rural areas.  As part of the EIB-Morocco partnership to support companies, the project has seen a total budget of €5 billion in the past ten years.

Rabat – Last week, Rabat held the 46th forum of the Academy of the Kingdom concerning “Asia as a Horizon for Thought.” On Thursday, December 12, representatives from India and Morocco discussed the two countries’ experiences in modernization and development. The Academy of the Kingdom is an education department based in Rabat that encourages research and exploration in intellectual sectors including contract science, philosophy, ethics and law, history, literature, fine arts, mathematics, experimental and non-experimental sciences, education, medicine, diplomacy, warfare science, economics, administration, construction, and technology.  The Academy aims to broaden its knowledge in such fields by focusing on international ties and inviting different nationalities to share their practices.  Chaired by Mohammed Kenbib, Professor at the Mohammed V University, speakers in the third plenary session focused on India in the context of globalization.  During the symposium, the delegations discussed India’s pursuit of strategic autonomy amidst global political disorder and the new economic order. Speakers also addressed critical perspectives on globality from India, Morocco and India in a globalized context, as well as mutual perceptions.  Another key topic for discussion was India’s engagement with rising Africa and the India-Morocco partnership as a contributing factor. Speakers emphasized the importance of collaboration between India and African countries, particularly Morocco as it provides a gateway into Africa and Europe. India also stressed the importance of maintaining its well-established relationship with Morocco by reflecting on past economic, financial, and diplomatic achievements.  In strengthening their cooperative ties, speakers looked over several partnership agreements on industrial advances such as fiber optics, automotive sectors, infrastructure, education, and commercial initiatives to encourage investment and production.  Speakers also reviewed the political changes that India underwent after its independence in 1947. In the midst of regional and international tensions, India made strides toward a democratic system; developed military defense; and created relationships between world powers.  Through the integration of linguistic and cultural policies, speakers emphasized India’s role in managing pluralism and cultural diversity in a global context to preserve India’s cultural and social pillars.  Speakers also discussed Morocco’s agricultural, industrial, energy, financial, and banking sectors in potential investment agreements between the two countries. According to Indian speakers, Morocco has demonstrated a “rational approach for trade and financial cooperation, in a way that meets the aspirations of Moroccan society and the ambitions of its youth, and which strengthens its position at the international level.”  Morocco and India’s political relationship dates back 50 years after India played an active role in the United Nations in support of Morocco’s independence in 1957. The two countries share many opinions on foreign policy.  The Minister of External Affairs in India stated after the signing of the Non-Aligned Movement, “India and Morocco have enjoyed cordial and friendly relations and over the years bilateral relations have witnessed significant depth and growth.”

Rabat – Turkey has deported a terror suspect back to Morocco as part of its strategy to repatriate all suspects with terror links to their countries of origin. Anadolu Agency reported on Monday, December 16, that the Turkish Ministry of Interior announced the deportation of a Moroccan national as part of Turkey’s “efforts to repatriate foreign terrorist fighters.” Turkey, according to the agency, said that some European countries resisted its strategy to send ISIS members back to their countries of origin. “It will nevertheless press forward,” the news outlet added. The Turkish government deported 7,500 members with links to ISIS to their countries, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said. Morocco, considered a leader in counterterrorism, has been intensifying efforts to abort any terror-related threats across the country. It also helps its international partners through sharing expertise in the field. In October, spokesman of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) Boubker Sabik said that more than 740 Moroccan ISIS fighters have died in conflict zones, including 657 in Syria. He added that the rest of the fighters were killed in conflict zones in Iraq. The DGSN spokesperson emphasized that 1,659 Moroccan fighters were operating in the Syrian-Iraqi conflict zones. “The number of returnees from conflict zones reached 260 people.” The ISIS suspects face charges after an intensive investigation by Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ). Terror defendants receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison. However, they also benefit from the “moussalaha” (reconciliation program), aiming to reintegrate prisoners into society. Morocco introduced the program in 2018. The government has eminent trust on the program.  The program seeks to counter violent extremism through strict security measures, regional cooperation, intelligence sharing, the promotion of moderate Islam, and democratic reform. Despite the terror threats, Morocco is considered one of the top safest countries across the world, according to the 2019 Global Terror Index. According to the report, Morocco is safer than many international powers, including the US, the UK, Canada, and France. Morocco is also safer than neighboring countries in the index, such as Algeria, and Tunisia.

Rabat – A group of 126 Sahrawis, all victims of human rights violations in a Polisario-run prison near Tindouf in Algeria, have addressed a letter to the international community asking for an end to their struggle. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro-Sahara has shared the letter, drawing attention to their plight. “We are the victims of the terrible El Rachid prison near the Sahrawi camps in Tindouf, southwestern Algeria. We are the signatories of the letter. Following the horrific [violence] we have been subjected to, we address the Sahrawi, international and regional public opinion and the readers to share our suffering [with you].” The signatories described the violence they have experienced from members of the executive committee of the Polisario as “an infernal and even barbaric behavior that is beyond imagination.” Polisario leaders bear responsibility The Sahrawis addressing the letters named three Polisario “officials,” including Ahmed Batal, Al Bashir Mustafa Al Sayed, and Ahmar Al Hadrami as perpetrators of human rights violations. The activists said that the three Polisario members bear all the responsibility for the violent crimes “authorities” in the prison have committed, including murder, torture, psychological and physical violence. The alleged victims also accused the three Polisario leading members of forcing detainees’ wives to divorce their husbands and “marrying them with some executioners. All this behavior was committed by the Executive Committee in the name of Sahrawi people.” The letter from the Sahrawi activists added that “there is no doubt that the testimonies of the victims in the past weeks have left a deep impact on Sahrawis in general.” Last week, Sahrawi activist Moulay Aba Bouzid spoke publicly about the threats and violence he has experienced at the hands of the Polisario Front following his release from a Polisario run prison. Bouzid was part of a group of activists who the Polisario imprisoned in June for taking part in demonstrations to condemn human rights violations in Tindouf. “I announce to the Sahrawi and international public that I receive continuous threats from the leaders of the Polisario Front,” said Aba Bouzid in his message. He continued that his two colleagues, Fadel Braika and  Mahmoud Zidane, have also received threat the same threats. The Polisario Front has been linked to several alleged cases of human rights violations, including the continued disappearance of Ahmed El Khalil, whose family has been looking for him since 2009. El Khalil was a leading member of the Polisario Front, but Algerian intelligence services and the Polisario Front allegedly kidnapped him just weeks after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in the camps. El Khalil’s family continues to protest his disappearance, calling on the Polisario Front to reveal his fate. A call for help The conditions in the Tindouf camps have not always had the international attention they deserve, with only a few rights NGOs condemning the arbitrary arrests in Tindouf. The UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres briefly mentioned the situation of Bouzid and his colleagues in his annual report in October. Paragraph 71 of the report said that the UN bodies were informed by the OHCHR about “the harassment, arrest, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment by Frente POLISARIO security forces of a human rights defender and a blogger engaged in documenting human rights violations in the region.” The signatories of the recent letter of the victims also said that they “remember the souls of the martyrs” from the prison and all the other Polisario-run prisons under the supervision of the leaders of the breakaway group. The victims are calling on the front to bring the “killers and executioners” to justice. “We want to expose the crimes we were exposed to in El Rachid prison and to enlighten Sahrawi public opinion. We also want to the [Polisario Front] to uncover the fate of the missing, martyrs, and remains of people [buried] in secret graves,” the victims concluded.

Rabat – Emirati authorities announced the arrest of Redouane Taghi, a Dutch-Moroccan at the head of the Moroccan mafia in the Netherlands, known as Mocro Maffia, in Dubai on Monday, December 16. Mocro Maffia is the largest drug trafficking network in Europe, operating in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. Taghi was the most wanted criminal in the Netherlands for several years, with Interpol actively looking to arrest him, according to Dutch-speaking Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. The Dutch-Moroccan criminal, known as De Neus, was at the head of the criminal network alongside Said Razzouki, another Dutch-Moroccan wanted by international police. Both criminals started dealing drugs at a young age, before becoming the biggest importers of cocaine to the Netherlands and Belgium, having developed partnerships with South American drug cartels. Authorities struggled to locate Taghi and still cannot locate Razzouki due to the numerous plastic surgeries they have both undergone to change their appearances, explained the Dutch authorities. Dutch police advertised a €100,000 bounty for anyone who could provide information leading to the arrest of the two criminals. The prize represented the largest sum of money ever allocated for information by Dutch authorities. The two men are also suspects in several homicides and assassinations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, and Morocco. On November 2, 2017, two Dutch members of the mafia opened fire at Cafe La Creme in Marrakech and then fled the scene on a large motorcycle. While the attack targeted the owner of the cafe, who was involved in drug trafficking, it caused the death of a young medical student and seriously injured his classmate. Moroccan police linked the crime to the settling of accounts between drug cartels working between Morocco and the Netherlands. Taghi is suspected of giving the order for the shooting.

Rabat – Paris-based international non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has released its annual report. This year, 49 journalists, including three women, died on assignment around the world, representing the lowest death toll in 16 years.  About 80 journalists a year have lost their lives on average over the last 20 years, said the organization. RSF added that most of the journalists who lost their lives this year died while covering conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and Afghanistan.  Among the victims are 36 professional journalists, 10 non-professionals, and 3 media collaborators. More than half of them (29) were killed in peace zones and more than 60% were deliberately targeted.  Head of RSF, Christophe Deloire, warned that the number of journalists killed in countries supposedly at peace was still alarmingly high, with 10 deaths in Mexico alone.  “Latin America, with a total of 14 reporters killed across the continent, has become as deadly as the Middle East,” he said.  While the number of fatalities in conflict zones notably fell, Deloire stated that “more and more journalists are being assassinated for their work in democratic countries, which is a real challenge to democracy.”  Though the number of fatalities among journalists fell in 2019, more are being incarcerated, according to RSF.  RSF recorded a 12% rise from last year’s figures, with 389 detainees. Nearly half of the journalists (186) are detained in three countries; China, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian kingdom has faced heavy criticism for brutally killing prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its embassy in Istanbul on November 2018.  “China, which has intensified its repression of the [mostly Muslim] Uighur minority, alone holds a third of the journalists locked up in the world,” RSF said.  Meanwhile, 57 journalists are being held hostage across the globe, mostly in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.  “There has been no notable freeing of hostages this year despite major developments in Syria,” the RSF, leading the NGO to fear for the worst for many of those abducted. In 2019, there have been no reports of missing journalists compared to three journalists reported missing in 2018.

Rabat – An inflatable boat carrying around 94 irregular immigrants of Sub-Saharan nationalities capsized off Nador’s coast, north of Morocco, early on Monday, December 16. Morocco’s Royal Navy has recovered seven bodies and rescued 70 immigrants, while 17 others remain missing, according to a military source. The survivors, including 10 women and a baby, were in poor health. The coast guard provided them with first aid before transporting them to Nador’s Hassani Hospital. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) in Rabat confirmed the incident, as relayed by Alarm Phone, a hotline to support people crossing the Mediterranean. +++ Shipwreck confirmed +++ At 14.48h CET we spoke to MRCC Rabat #Morocco again who confirmed a shipwreck – 63 people were rescued, 7 people died &amp; 20 people are missing. We believe it’s the boat that alerted us earlier. We are devastated and hope more survivors will be found. — Alarm Phone (@alarm_phone) December 16, 2019 AlarmPhone contacted both Moroccan and Spanish authorities to notify them of the capsizing boat. Morocco’s Royal Navy was the first to respond. While Morocco’s strategy to combat irregular migration is considered effective to some extent and has led to a reduction in the number of immigrants in recent years, it seems that there is still room for more improvement. Former spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said in August that Moroccan authorities aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. However, the dream of crossing the Mediterranean for a better future continues to draw thousands of immigrants from Morocco and other countries to their death. According to recent statistics, nearly 80,000 migrants reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2019, and over a thousand people died during their migration attempts, coming from both Africa and the Middle East.

Rabat – Moroccan police in Errachidia arrested two suspects involved in a criminal network on suspicion of drug trafficking on December 15. The security services made the arrest on the basis of information from the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that police arrested the two suspects, aged 40 and 42, on the road to Erfoud, in the Draa-Tafilalet region. The suspects were in a 4×4 vehicle. The suspects were in possession of a sum of money of nearly MAD 691,800 and are suspected of having links with the international traffic of drugs and psychotropics. Following the arrest, a search in the rural commune “Al Mssisi”, about 90 km from the town of Tinghir, led to the seizure of 2.93 tonnes of cannabis resin concealed in the form of 73 large packages hidden under piles of stones in a vacant lot. Police placed the suspects in custody for further investigation to identify all the accomplices involved in this criminal network. During the previous weekend, police also seized 650 kilograms of cannabis resin in Agadir. The suspects involved in the drug trafficking network are on the run, the DGSN said in a statement on December 14.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of  Industry, Trade, and Green Economy and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, congratulated the country on the remarkable progress it has made in the field of industry, particularly the automotive sector and aeronautics. Speaking before the committee of agriculture and productive sectors at the House of councilors in parliament on Tuesday, December 10, Elalamy underlined the value of Moroccan expertise, explaining that a plant in England sought the advice of Moroccan experts.  Elalamy explained that a group of Moroccan engineers intervened after the failure of their international counterparts to run a plant that had experienced hardships. “Thanks to King Mohammed VI’s wisdom and his instructions to the government to develop industrial plans, Morocco has made miracles. These achievements were made thanks to the competency of the Moroccan workforce that has impressed the Japanese, Americans, and Chinese that visited Morocco,” said the minister. “It must not be understood that we just tighten the bolts of cars, as some claim. No gentlemen, our factories manufacture cars with all their components from A to Z and I invite you to visit the factories of Tangier, Kenitra, and Nouaceur to discover Moroccan genius,” he added. To corroborate his remarks, Elalamy stressed that Moroccan engineers and experts manufacture the entire engine for French carmaker Peugeot, as well as spare parts. Exports in this field reach €1 billion. To conclude, the top official revealed that Morocco has already begun to manufacture electric cars and is on the way to producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the last five years, Morocco has seen an influx of car and car parts companies to its various Industrial Zones, called Free Zones. Attracting automotive and aeronautics companies was the bedrock of Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan, enabling Morocco to create 81% of its goal of 500,000 direct and indirect jobs since 2014. Morocco’s acquired experience in the field qualified it to make the first Made-in-Morocco car, namely the 2020 model of Peugeot 208. The car was out on July 2018. The prototype was manufactured inside the PSA Group plant in Kenitra, Morocco and required an estimated investment amount of €557 million, with a capacity of 200,000 vehicles, 90% of which will be exported to the rest of Africa and the Middle East. The plant, inaugurated by Mohammed VI and Emmanuel Macron on June 20, will only produce smaller vehicles like the latest Peugeot 208 model. The car will be entering the Moroccan market in January 2020.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has again defied the United Nations’ warnings, violating its resolutions to stay out of all UN restricted areas in Western Sahara. The Polisario Front leader, Ibrahim Ghali along with military patrols and Polisario representatives met at a  “national” conference in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense belt, known as the berm, on December 15. The conference is part of the preparations for the  “15th Congress of the Polisario Front,” set to take place in Tifariti, claimed as a “liberated” town by the breakaway group, on December 19-23.  In a speech to the attendees, Ghali threatened the United Nations and accused the Security Council of lack of “responsibility”. In the speech, Ghali said the Polisario  “cannot continue dealing with the United Nations endeavor unless the Security Council bears its responsibility.” Quoted by the Polisario’s official news agency SPRASD, Ghali added that “after more than 28 years of ceasefire between the Sahrawi and Moroccan armies without achieving the main objective of organizing a referendum for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people, the Polisario Front confirms that it cannot continue to deal in the same way with the endeavor of the United Nations.” He warned that the Polisario will comply with the UN if “the Security Council assumes its responsibility and commitment to implementing fully the provisions set out in the African United Nations settlement plan, which it ratified in 1991.” With this move, the Polisario Front has once again violated the UN warnings regarding the UN restricted zones in Western Sahara. In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres informed the Security Council of the Polisario’s continuous violations in the restricted areas in his report on the situation in Western Sahara. The UN chief said that the Polisario’s representatives failed to “comply with requests by MINURSO to resolve” some violations. In his report, Guterres emphasized that the breakaway group has not yet responded to warnings to remove buildings “recently constructed by Frente Polisario in various locations outside of the restricted area.”. “A logistics hub consisting of 10 new buildings located inside the restricted area near Bir Lahlou, which had already been declared a violation in 2017 and included in the list of long-standing violations in 2018, remained operational,” the report said. The document also referred to other new buildings in Tifariti used by Polisario’s army and the relocation of “security detachment” in the same region. Other violations include activities in other buildings including the “unauthorized relocation” of an engineering company in Tifariti. The report added that the Polisario Front has established five new observation posts in Agwanit, Bir Lahlou, and Tifariti, which are all restricted areas. For the UN, the actions are classed as “violations.” In its new Resolution 2494, adopted in October, the Security Council  expressed “concern about the violations of existing agreements, reiterating the importance of full adherence to these commitments in order to sustain momentum in the Western Sahara political process.” The resolution also called upon the parties to the conflict to “demonstrate further political will towards a solution including by expanding upon their discussion of each other’s proposals and recommitting to UN efforts.” It also called on Algeria and Mauritania to “to make contributions to the political process.” Resolution 2440 of October 2018 also called on the Polisario to “fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat.”

Rabat – Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has criticized Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhannouch for a controversial statement he recently made about Moroccans. On December 7, Akhannouch criticized people for lack of respect for the Moroccan state and its institutions, saying that some Moroccans should be “disciplined.” The statement has not gone unnoticed, with Moroccan citizens and public figures slamming Akhannouch, also one of the wealthiest people in Africa, for his disrespectful remarks. Benkirane has joined the list of the people who were unhappy with Akhannouch’s latest statement. Speaking at the 5th Regional Youth Congress for the Justice and Development Party (PJD) held recently in Bouznika, near Rabat, Benkirane said that “everyone must be waiting for my response to what Akhannouch has recently said.” The former head of government said that Akhannouch made a mistake by talking about discipline. “It is not your right to say this Mr. Akhannouch. Disciplining people is not your duty,” Benkirane said. The former PJD leader interpreted the word “discipline” as “punishment.”  “When Moroccans say discipline, they are talking about punishment. And justice is the only institution to punish people if someone violates the law. It is not your business to discipline anyone,” Benkirane said firmly. The politician received loud applause for his statement at the congress. He added, “We don’t understand what is meant by ‘Moroccans should do their job,’” referencing Akhannouch’s statement. The agriculture minister, who is also the leader of the National Rally of Independents Party (RNI), said that “Justice is not the [only institution] that has to do its job, Moroccans should also do their job.” “We don’t understand what he means. The least you can do is apologize to Moroccans, Mr. Akhannouch,” Benkirane suggested. The politician also commented on a certain group of people, who recently appeared in videos criticizing the King and Moroccan state. “Those people said some things that don’t make sense, but at the same time they said things that affect them. Nobody criticized them, but some criticized them for talking about the monarch in an unacceptable way in Morocco.” Before addressing Akhannouch’s speech, Bekinrane spoke about the importance of the monarchy. He emphasized that in Morocco “our state is 100% a monarchy.”  “Defending the monarchy is not one individual’s role, it is the role of all Moroccans, who believe in monarchy,” he said. The former head of government said that the “monarchy system established itself as the best regime at least in this phase.” “Our country went through several hard times, including the Arab Spring and we passed it in peace,” said Benkirane thanking the monarch for his approach to dealing with political crisis.

Rabat – The speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, told an Israeli journalist in Paris that he could not confirm any “intention” from Morocco to improve relations with Israel. El Malki was in Paris at the Moroccan-French parliamentary forum and spoke to Hebrew outlet Maariv, along with Abdessamad Kayouh, the first vice president of Morocco’s upper house, the House of Councillors. Kayouh explained, “It is not possible to publicly discuss relations with Israel.” He added that Morocco’s position on Israel remains the same, despite recent rumors in Israeli media outlets. The Moroccan parliamentarians also denied that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had requested to visit King Mohammed VI earlier this month. El Malki and Kayouh said the story came from “media rumors.” On December 5, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Morocco for several hours instead of an originally-scheduled two-day visit. Pompeo had delayed and shortened his Morocco trip by making a stop in Lisbon on December 4, where he met with Netanyahu. Before Pompeo’s trip, a senior state department official had alleged that Morocco “has these quiet ties and relationship with Israel as well, as we all know.” Israeli outlets suggested that Netanyahu wanted to visit Morocco with Pompeo to meet the King. Neither official, however, met King Mohammed VI. The Israeli prime minister did not join Pompeo in Morocco, and Pompeo’s meeting and dinner with the King were cancelled. However unwelcome Netanyahu may be, El Malki and Kayouh said Israelis are still welcome to visit Morocco. Hundreds of Moroccan Jews visit Essaouira every September on the anniversary of the death of Rabbi Haim Pinto. The majority of Moroccan Jews emigrated from the country in the last century, but there are still an estimated 2,000 Moroccan Jews living in the kingdom.

Rabat – German car manufacturer Volkswagen announced the suspension of all its activities in Algeria until further notice. Volkswagen made the announcement on Saturday, December 14, only one day after the election of the new Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. “Because of the political crisis in Algeria, Volkswagen has suspended production in this North African country at the moment. Deliveries to the official partner of the country, Sovac, have also been suspended,” Volkswagen told the German press. The German company’s decision is a result of the political crisis in Algeria. The 10-month-old crisis started in February 2019 and is still ongoing, despite the election of a new president. Tebboune is considered to be close to the sacked president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and to the Chief of the Army Ahmed Gaid Salah. The German company explained that another reason behind their decision was the lack of transparency in their plans with their Algerian partner Sovac, especially after the arrest of its head in June. On Thursday, June 13, Algerian police arrested Mourad Eulmi, the head of Sovac, at a car assembly plant in Relizane, western Algeria, over corruption allegations. The arrest came amid a series of anti-corruption investigations targeting the ruling elite in Algeria. One day after Volkswagen’s announcement, the Algerian partner responded by clarifying the situation. According to a manager at Sovac, Volkswagen did not decide to suspend its partnership with the Algerian company, explaining that “more than 1500 assembly kits destined for Relizane plant are still blocked in Oran’s port, northwest Algeria, since last July, and more than 2200 kits are blocked in European ports.” Following this unexplained blocking, Volkswagen decided to suspend shipping assembly kits to Algeria last August, explains the same source. As a result, “around 700 employees are in technical unemployment” and the “plant stopped [functioning] since last September.” Volkswagen has been operating in Algeria since 1999. In 2016, Volkswagen and Sovac opened a joint assembly plant in Relizane. The plant produced 50,000 vehicles last year.

Rabat – The German federal government is planning to facilitate visa procedures to attract non-EU skilled workforce as part of a broad government campaign to tackle job shortage in Germany. On her weekly podcast on Saturday, December 14, Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that the shortage in qualified labor could make companies move elsewhere, reported German news outlet DW on Sunday, December 15. “We know that many sectors and businesses are looking for skilled workers. Without sufficient skilled workers, a business location cannot be successful,” Merkel said.  “That is why it is necessary for us to make every effort to recruit a sufficient number of specialists. Otherwise, companies will have to migrate — and, of course, we do not want that,” she added. Merkel is set to meet the Federal Minister of Economy Peter Altmayer, state representatives, economic departments, and labor unions, on Monday at the Chancellery Court, to discuss means to tackle the skilled workforce crisis.  On March 1, 2020, Germany will implement the Skilled Workers Immigration Act to facilitate immigration procedures for skilled workers from non-EU countries. The meeting is expected to result in the adoption of a memorandum of understanding on how to best put the new skilled immigration law into practice.  To facilitate the implementation of the new law, Germany has taken practical measures by increasing the number of staff in German embassies and consulates abroad to speed up granting entry visas procedures. The program also plans to provide appropriate conditions for submitting applications electronically. The German government is seeking to expand the German language courses abroad offered by the Goethe Institutes, located in a large number of countries in the world. It also suggests companies and employers in Germany bear the costs of German language courses in appropriate cases, depending on the need for skilled forces. Germany is facing a shortage of skilled laborers in the fields of electrical engineering, metalworking, and mechatronics. The country also needs cooks, nurses, aged care workers, computer scientists, and software developers.

Rabat – The third police district of Marrakech has arrested two suspects for robbing two Asian tourists. The district launched an investigation after they received a complaint from the victims. The suspects allegedly stole a sum of money in foreign currency from the victims, and then ran away. Authorities identified the suspects based on the victims’ descriptions and arrested them at their homes. During the arrest, police seized clothes that matched the victims’ descriptions. The tourists also confirmed the suspects’ identity in a police lineup. Police put the two suspects in custody for further investigations before their court hearing. The authorities’ quick response is part of their policy to ensure tourist protection. Tourist protection has gained a lot of importance in the region of Marrakech-Safi in the last year, especially after Imlil murders in December 2018. Authorities have installed checkpoints and surveillance cameras in several spots, both in Marrakech and in the surrounding region. In July, Royal Gendarmerie provided quads to its units and mobile officers. The vehicles aim to facilitate monitoring tourists during their visit to the region. The efforts aim to preserve the image of Marrakech as a top tourist destination. In September, Morocco’s Tourism Observatory said that 7.544 million tourists visited Morocco by the end of July 2019. The cities of Marrakech and Agadir alone have generated 57% of hotel nights in the first seven months of 2019. American magazine Forbes also named Marrakech among the top 50 most beautiful cities in the world.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has reserved 200 positions in the public sector for people with special needs for 2020, according to Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The Head of Government made the announcement on Sunday, December 16, at the National Higher School for Administration in Rabat. The school, along with three other centers, held the standardized competitive examination for people with special needs, a national examination to recruit candidates for the 200 protected positions. The standardized examination, held for the second time this year, is a means to ensure equal opportunities for people with special needs who want to work for the public sector, according to El Othmani. The head of government also commended the “positive conditions” in which the examination took place, and promised that the government will continue to hold these examinations on a regular basis. Applicants who pass the examination will be allocated to work in different sectors depending on their abilities and trainings. Speaking at the announcement, the Minister of Solidarity, Social Development, Equality, and Family, Jamila El Moussali, said that the government has kept its promise to people with special needs by organizing this examination. This examination is only one way to include this category of people in public sector positions, she added. More than 1,000 people applied to take the examination, from different regions of the Kingdom. Most applicants received training from NGOs to prepare them for the examination, noted El Moussali. The minister also indicated that several regional centers accepted the applications, so that applicants do not have to travel to Rabat to submit their documents. The examination comes after a series of coordination meetings between the Head of Government and the concerned ministries, which resulted in the allocation of the 200 positions. While the initiative aims to ensure inclusive employment for people with special needs, it is not a cure-all solution. Disability rights activists have been fighting for a better life for years now. Their demands include special ID cards, social grants, free transportation, employment opportunities, and special schooling facilities for children with intellectual disabilities. “We want the government to activate their plans to promote handicapped people’s rights. They keep giving us fake promises to improve Morocco’s image on the international level, but in reality, disabled people in Morocco are still living in a very difficult situation,” activist Hafid El Hanouni told Morocco World News on Tuesday, October 8.

Rabat – Head coach of Real Madrid Zinedine Zidane said that Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi has a “great future” with the Spanish football giant. In a recent press conference, Zidane spoke about Hakimi future with Real Madrid, expressing satisfaction with the youngster’s performance at his current German club, Borussia Dortmund. Real Madrid loaned Hakimi to the German club in 2018 for a two-year contract in order to develop his playing skills. The football player shone in the Bundesliga, or the German league, with spectacular performances throughout the 2018 and 2019 seasons with Dortmund. Speaking about his return to Real Madrid, Zidane said that it is still not the right time for the Moroccan international to return to Real Madrid. Quoted in the Bundesliga news outlet, Zidane said that Hakimi will “spend another year in Dortmund.” He added that Hakimi is a good player – we all know that – but it’s good for him to stay there and get another year of match practice behind him.” During his seasons with Real Madrid, Hakimi made 17 appearances for the Los Blancos in the 2017/2018 season. Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, Hakimi chose to represent Morocco instead of Spain in international football. Hakimi is a key player for Morocco’s national team, having played in all-important games with the Atlas Lions, including the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN) and the 2018 World Cup. In May, Hakimi said that he hopes to return to Real Madrid. “It would be a dream for me to return to Real Madrid as soon as possible. I would be lying if I said otherwise,” he said. Hakimi, however, is happy with his German club. He said recently that joining Dortmund had  helped him to “mature and grow.” In February 2018, the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) ranked the Moroccan star among Europe’s 50 Most Promising Under-20 footballers. That December, Hakimi won a second Bundesliga Rookie of the Month Award.

Rabat – A Moroccan man has died in Spain after receiving a diagnosis of rabies. The middle-aged man had traveled to Morocco, where a cat bit him, in August, reports Spanish news outlet El Pais. The man presented symptoms of rabies when he was admitted to a hospital on Friday, December 6, near Bilbao in the autonomous Basque region of northern Spain.  Last week, on December 10, doctors at the University Hospital of Cruces confirmed through tests at the National Center for Microbiology at the Carlos III Health Institute that the man had rabies. The Moroccan died Friday evening, December 13, according to El Pais. El Espanol reported that the man’s death was the first case of rabies in a human that the Basque region had seen in 30 years. Once a person begins to notice the symptoms of rabies, chances of surviving the disease are extremely low. Symptoms of rabies, a disease usually transmitted from animal bites and scratches, can appear months or a year after the bite. Rabies is present in 150 countries in the world, including Morocco, the World Health Organization says. There is a pre-exposure preventive vaccination for rabies that can be given to people at risk of being bitten. Post-bite vaccinations, given shortly after being bitten by an animal, save hundreds of thousands of lives each year, the WHO estimates. The rabies virus damages the central nervous system, creating “fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord,” according to the WHO. Often, victims of rabies display hyperactive behavior and die within a few days. Just over a year ago, a British tourist died of rabies after being bitten in Morocco. In 2017, Morocco saw approximately 15 cases of people contracting rabies, down from 43 in 1985.

Rabat –  King Mohammed VI has sent a congratulatory cable to Abdelmadjid Tebboune after his election as President of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria. In his message, the Moroccan monarch expressed his “heartfelt congratulations and his best wishes of full success in office” to the new Algerian president.  The King also reiterated his call to open a “new page in relations between the two neighboring countries, based on mutual trust and constructive dialogue.” Previously, in November 2018, the King had insisted that Morocco was ready to   engage in a frank and serious dialogue with Algeria o to break the “political stalemate between Rabat and Algiers, to restore full diplomatic ties, and to reopen the borders between the two countries.” In July 2019, the King renewed his call for dialogue with Algeria on the 20th anniversary of his ascension to the throne. The monarch said that Morocco has reaffirmed its sincere commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations.” Since then, the Algerian government has been turning a deaf ear to Morocco’s offer. During his presidential campaign, Tebboune made several remarks about the cold relations between Morocco and Algeria.  The Algerian president-elect also notably spoke about Rabat in his first statements as president Algeria. In both instances, however, Tebboune’s remarks were vague, meandering, and even hawkish at times.  He mostly put the blame on Morocco for the fraught relations between the two neighbors. And when appearing to talk about the need to open borders, he has done so offhandedly, downplaying the extent of the hostility between the two countries and not once addressing Morocco’s repeated calls for dialogue.  He said before his election that Morocco should apologize to Algeria for imposing visa regulations on Algerians after the Asni attacks in Marrakech in August 1994. The statements are seen as hostile towards Morocco.  In a recent statement, made following his election on December 13, Tebboune confirmed his country’s position, emphasizing that “there have been events that have caused the borders to close [between Algeria and Morocco]. In my opinion, the main cause of the conflict must be removed and everything else will follow.” He also said that he is “extremely sensitive when it comes to national sovereignty. I forgive no one for interfering or for harming our sovereignty.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ)  arrested a suspect with links to the self-proclaimed Islmaic State (ISIS)  on Saturday, December 14 in Meknes. The BCIJ carried out the arrest in coordination with the judicial police of the city of Meknes, a statement from the BCIJ said on December 15. Preliminary investigations, according to the statement, confirm the involvement of the suspect, described as a “41-year-old extremist,” in promoting the “extremist ideology of ISIS.” He was also “seeking to get more information and experiences, especially those related to how to use weapons,” added the same source. The BCIJ said that the suspect was plotting a suicide operation to cause “massive damage.” Security services seized electronic devices as well as manuscripts related to materials used in preparing explosives. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigations.  Terror suspects traditionally receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison. The operation is part of Morocco’s “comprehensive” approach against terror-related crimes and threats. Throughout the year, Morocco’s BCIJ dismantled several ISIS-linked cells, arrestesting numerous terror suspects. The latest opera arrest operation took place on November 26 in Sale. The BCIJ arrested a suspect for promoting ISIS destructive ideology on social media. The suspect was inciting terror acts by ISIS “lone wolves.”  He also recorded an audio message in which he explained “the methods of manufacturing explosives and explosive belts,” the BCIJ said.

Rabat – Abdelmadjid Tebboune, the newly elected President of Algeria, has again commented on the foreign policy of his country regarding the icy diplomatic relations between Rabat and Algiers, off-handedly calling for appeasement but unmistakably vague on specifics. Speaking on December 13, moments after the announcement of his victory after the heavily contested presidential election, Tebboune notably mentioned the cold relations with Morocco after a journalist asked him about his foreign strategy towards neighboring countries. “I am extremely sensitive with regards to national sovereignty. I forgive no one for interfering or for harming our sovereignty,” said Algeria’s president-elect. Throughout the crisis in Algeria, both before and after the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Morocco has firmly stood by the principle of non-interference, shying away from commenting on the Algerian popular movements and protests. Morocco “neither meddles with the internal developments that Algeria witnesses nor comment on them,” Morocco’s FM, Nasser Bourita, said earlier this year. Bogus appeasement In his December 13 remarks, Tebboune, who has previously espoused hawkish views on Morocco-Algeria relations, seemed to be drifting towards some sort of appeasement, tartly playing down the very hostility, he has once helped fuel. The new Algerian President emphasized that he knows “Moroccans very well. I know that the people there love Algeria and Algerians.” Algerians, he added, have the same sentiments for Moroccans. “They are nice people.” “There have been events that have caused the borders to close [between Algeria and Morocco]. In my opinion, the main cause of the conflict must be removed and everything else will follow,” he said without specifying the nature of the cause. He said that relations should be based on reciprocity. Morocco has already made a positive move towards Algeria, inviting the government to engage in a frank and serious dialogue to “break the stalemate” between the two neighbors. The initiative came from King Mohammed VI, who in his 2018 Green March speech, spoke about the “abnormal” relations between the two nations. This is not the first time that Tebboune has commented on the Rabat-Algiers frozen diplomatic ties. During his election campaign, the Algerian president called on Morocco to apologize for imposing visa regulations on Algerians after Asni terror attack in Marrakech in August 1994. In the wake of the attack, Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens, and Algeria closed the border. On Sunday, November 24, as part of his election campaign, Tebboune said, Morocco should issue a “formal apology” to Algiers as a condition for reopening its borders with Morocco. Tebboune also claimed that Algeria’s decision to close the border was not due to the Western Sahara conflict. Business as usual Algeria has long supported the Polisario Front, the breakaway group seeking independence in Western Sahara. Algeria hosts the group in the Tindouf province, where thousands of Sahrawi refugees live in what many international observers have described as inhumane conditions. The Algerian president said that Algeria rejects the claims of its “involvement in the case of the Atlas Asni bombings in Marrakech.” He also condemned Morocco’s decision to impose visa regulations on Algerian citizens. “Algerians have been stranded in the Moroccan territories and visa regulations were imposed on Algerians of French origin,” he said. Tebboune won the election with a majority of 58% of the vote, amid backlash and boycotted ballots by Algerians, who refused the election on the ground that all the candidates were deeply connected to the politico-military establishment of the Bouteflika era and would not deliver the kind of radical changes many Algerians hoped for after President Bouteflika was forced to resign last April. A veteran of the Bouteflika cohort, having notably served as Prime Minister between 2012 and 2017, the 74-year-old’s election is largely seen as a continuation of the old Algerian regime, with a number of Moroccan observers arguing that Rabat-Algiers diplomatic rapprochement is nearly impossible in the next five years.

Rabat – The New York Times Style Magazine has listed Morocco’s Draa  Valley among the 10 Most Idyllic Destinations to visit in 2019. The publication said that it travelled to a set of lands that give birth to “some of the world’s most ancient cultures from Morocco’s Draa Valley, once ruled by Berber Kings, to Ithaca, Greece.” Sitting deep in southern Morocco, the valley is home to green plains, and long palm trees that look down at the river, Draa, considered Morocco’s largest.  The valley stretches from Morocco’s artistic city of Ouarzazate, also known as the Hollywood of Africa due to its numerous movie studios. The region is heavily decorated in the cinema world, with many renowned Hollywood films or at least movie scenes  having been shot there.  Lonely Planet, one of the leading travel guides in the tourism industry, described the Daraa valley as a place “formed by a narrow ribbon of water from the High Alas that occasionally emerges triumphantly in lash oases, particularly between Agdz and Zagora.” The region still preserves its originality and history from the 17 and 18th centuries, with houses built of clay and simple materials. The houses gave the region an earthy-colored artistic view for photography lovers. The palm trees and green plains gave the view a sense of life with the high Atlas Mountains surrounding the place. The New York Times put a backlink of an article published in May 2019 from its author Aatish Taseer, who explored the region with the help of a local guide. Taseer said, “South of Marrakesh, the Draa Valley still exerts an indefinable pull, retaining traces of its now almost-vanished Berber kingdom.”  He added that “One had to go much farther south, across the Atlas and into the Draa Valley, an 8,900-square-mile oasis that ran along the Algerian border, to get a whiff of that world to which the exchange of goods and ideas — first salt, silver and slaves, then religion, manuscripts and notions of kingship — had given an inner cohesion.”

Rabat – International football player Mesut Ozil has slammed China for rounding up and detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims. The football player used social media to raise awareness about the situation of Uighur Muslims, who are suffering detention and strict policy. The football player wrote that Qurans are burned, and mosques were closed in China, urging Muslims to speak up against the systemic mistreatment. “Islamic theological schools, madrasas [Islamic schools] were banned, religious scholars were killed one b one” in China. Ozil also  blamed Muslims for looking the other way while Uighurs’ plight has only worsened in the past months.  “Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet.” In his statement, the Muslim football player, who currently plays for Arsenal, likened Muslims’ silence to a tacit approval of the situation.  “They don’t know that giving consent for persecution is persecution itself. The honorable Ali, son-i-law of the Prophet Muhammad says that ‘if you cannot prevent persecution, expose it,’” he said tartly. The football player also expressed support for the Uighur Muslims, calling them warriors who resist persecution. In a surprising move, Arsenal issued a statement to distance itself from the football player’s statement. “The content he expressed is entirely Ozil’s personal opinion,” the English club wrote. Arsenal also said that it is always “apolitical as an organisation.” China has long denied accusations on Uighur Muslims’ plight.  The country calls the detention camps “voluntary” and says they are re-education centers to combat extremism.  Rights groups, however, have maintained that the Muslim community of Uighurs are experiencing systemic, state-sponsored injustice. Human Rights Watch described  the actions taken against the Uighur Muslims as “rampant abuses” that “violate fundamental rights to freedom of expression, religion, and privacy, and protections from torture and unfair trials. Meanwhile, recently leaked Communist Party documents have revealed China’s policy on detention camps for Uighur Muslims in its western Xinjiang province. The leaked documents include a memo from 2017 giving instructions on how to run the detention camps. In the memo, the chief deputy of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, said camp staff must “strictly manage and control student activities to prevent escapes during class, eating periods, toilet breaks, bath time, medical treatment, family visits, etc.”

Rabat – At first glance, Place Pietri in Rabat seems somewhat barren and dry. But after spending time there, one realizes the beauty of the open and simple space.  During the day office workers enjoy breakfast and lunch on its sunny terraces. During the evenings, children play while their parents relax and watch the sunset while drinking tea. The plaza is one story lower than the surrounding streets and sidewalk which sets up dramatic views of the art deco architecture across the plaza. Last month I saw a construction sign for a project which would cover the plaza with an immense roof. I shared a photo of the sign with my Moroccan colleagues who agreed that this would ruin the plaza. The terraces will be in shadow, and the open views across the plaza will be blocked. As an architect who uses the plaza for work meetings or to spend time with my own family, I feel the proposed project will result in Place Pietri losing its character as one of the most iconic plazas of Rabat.  Sadly, the restaurants and cafes will likely suffer a loss of business both during and after construction. Nobody wants to drink coffee in a cave. This is not the only recent project that makes a place worse instead of better. Rabat’s beach, called the Plage de Rabat, was recently divided by a massive concrete wall that cuts off the promenade from the beach.  These walls now collect garbage, umbrellas, and chairs. The drop from the walkway to the sand below is dangerously high, more than two meters in some places. Ramps that funnel people onto the sand are too steep and hard to see from the beach.  Surf instructors note that the sand is being washed away from under the walls and they will eventually fall. Maybe this is for the better. The solution is listening to people. Projects which impact public space are not straightforward engineering tasks. Therefore the planning process should be open and transparent rather than closed and bureaucratic.  In both of these recent examples, it is evident that planners overlooked the needs and desires of people. Nobody talked to the cafe owners at Place Pietri. Nobody interviewed the surf instructors at the Plage de Rabat.  Changes to beloved public spaces require feedback from local residents and business owners in order to be successful. Architects need to start the project by going out and asking questions. Often, the most valuable feedback will come from the very people who are least likely to have time to spare: Small business owners, workers, and their customers. Planners have to make an effort to contact the people who most use the space. Once they understand what people want and need in a place, city planners must discuss the design in presentations that are open to the public. There should be presentations at the beginning, middle, and end of the design process. It should be clear when and where these meetings occur and how to give feedback.  Finally, it is the task of the city and its design team to determine which feedback is valid and which is not. There will always be some negative feedback, and it is impossible to make everyone happy. Thus it is important to keep the overall goals in mind and not get lost in a never-ending discussion. Good city planning can be messy and time-consuming. Debate can go on for months or years; however, the results will be better in the long run. It is always better to go slow and get things right than to go fast and make mistakes.

Rabat – The UN mission in Western Sahara has cast doubt on Algeria’s denial of insecurity and terrorist threats in the Tindouf camps, with a MINURSO official confirming reception of security warnings from Algiers. Speaking to Spanish outlet EFE on Wednesday, November 11, a spokesperson for MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, confirmed the reports about insecurity and terrorist threats in the Polisario-run camps in Tindouf. The MINURSO official said that the UN mission received security warnings from Spain and Algiers, with notes from both countries stressing the “imminence” of kidnapping operations and terrorist strikes in the form of  car bomb attacks. According to the MINURSO source, the UN mission in Western Sahara was told to “take precautionary measures” and be vigilant in the coming weeks and months, amid rising insecurity in the Sahel corridor and in neighboring Mali and Niger. The news comes days after Algiers strongly denied claims that it had issued any such security warnings, calling the reports “false and unfounded.” Reports of Algeria’s warnings first emerged on December 2. “The Algerian government has sent MINURSO “information regarding preparations to kidnap foreign nationals in the refugee camps and in areas east of the [Morocco’s defense] wall,” reported TSA, an Algerian outlet known for being privy to the secrets of the country’s political and military establishments. Algeria, however, strongly denied the reports just hours after TAS’s report, saying that the “unfounded” claims originated from “foreign outlets” hostile to Algeria and only intended to “harm Algeria, its people, and its institutions.” The denial from Algiers was mostly perceived as a move to discourage a pro-Morocco reading of the reported insecurity and terrorism threats in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps. Rabat has repeatedly pointed to the fragility in the Polisario-run territory as one of the many proofs why a Polisario-run republique would be an invitation to chaos and instability in the Sahel-Saharan corridor. For Algeria to confirm the rise of insecurity would somehow amount to supporting one of Morocco’s sticking points in the Western Sahara question. When Spain warned its citizens against traveling to the Tindouf camps, citing “heightened insecurity” in the region, the Polisario Front lambasted Madrid for colliding with Rabat to “create ambiguity and confusion, and even paint a fabricated picture of fear and imminent danger in the Sahrawi refugee camps.” But with this reported confirmation from MINURSO that the UN mission had indeed received warnings from Algiers, it is to be seen what will emerge of the story of insecurity and terrorism in Tindouf. Meanwhile, the recent election of Abdelmajid Tebboune, a veteran of the Bouteflika era who is known for his notably hawkish take  on the Morocco-Algeria relations, may have decisively put to rest hopes of Rabat-Algiers rapprochement for at least the next five years.

Rabat – Sahrawi activist and journalist Moulay Aba Bouzid shared a public statement, denouncing the threats he is receiving from the Polisario Front. Former Polisario official Mustafa Salma shared Bouzid’s message on his Facebook page on Saturday, December 14, in the early morning. “I announce to the Sahrawi and international public that I receive continuous threats from the leaders of the Polisario Front,” starts the message. Bouzid says that patrol cars belonging to the Polisario’s leadership follow him wherever he goes. He also denounces the threatening calls and recordings that he receives every day. The threats include killing, imprisoning, kidnapping, physical violence, and targeting his “family’s honor.” “The same threats target my colleagues Fadel Braika and Mahmoud Zidane, and they are the same threats that I received before my detention last June,” says Bouzid. In June 2019, the Polisario Front arrested the three Sahrawi activists, detaining them for several months without trial. On November 10, the breakaway group finally released them, after increasing pressure from international human rights organizations. In his message, Bouzid also warns of an upcoming wave of arrests and detentions against activists opposing the Polisario’s rule. “The Polisario Front will increase its oppression of free voices and will start a large campaign of arrests among [the activists] opposing its policies,” says Bouzid in a warning to his colleagues. “The front will also start tightening freedoms gradually, including the freedom of moving, doing trade, and getting passports,” he continues. The activist also recalls the “propaganda” that the front spread after his arrest in June to justify his arbitrary detention. At the end of his speech, Bouzid calls on international human rights organizations to ensure his safety. “I call on all international human rights organizations to protect me from the terrorist gang of the Polisario Front and to impose restrictions on this gang to guarantee human rights in the Sahrawi refugee camps.” “I hold the Polisario Front responsible for any harm that reaches me or my dignity, I also hold them responsible for any act I do in self-defense,” he adds. The activist shared a copy of his message with several international officials and organizations, including the UN’s secretary-general and Human Rights Watch.

Rabat – Attijariwafa bank (AWB) has signed a partnership agreement with the National Bank of Canada (NBC) to facilitate banking services for Moroccans residing in Canada, including students. The communications and marketing director of the Attijariwafa Bank group, Younes Kettani, signed the cooperation agreement with the first vice-president of the Canadian Bank, Jean-François Hanczakowski, in the presence of the head of Attijariwafa bank Canada, Mohamed Hamdouni. AWB CEO said in a statement that the cooperation agreement “will allow, thus, to offer quality service and banking support to the customers of individuals, to facilitate the various steps to be taken by new Moroccan migrants before their arrival and after their settlement in Canada.” “The new cooperation also concerns Moroccan and Canadian companies for support in the business world in Canada, Morocco and even in Africa,” he specified. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Hanczakowski said that “this partnership will allow the National Bank of Canada to offer its customers a privileged link with a Moroccan bank and will allow Attijariwafa bank customers wishing to settle in Canada to benefit from a package for settlement in good conditions.” Meanwhile, the first vice-president of corporate and insurance management for the Canadian group, Stephane Achard, encouraged Canadian companies to collaborate with Morocco. “In the current context, many companies are called upon to turn to Morocco in search of partnership, expertise, and qualified skills,” Achard stated.  He concluded that the partnership will help these companies in their quest but also welcome Moroccan customers wishing to do business in the North American country.

Rabat – In the Moroccan community in the Netherlands, Mohamed Ihattaren, the promising Dutch-Moroccan attacking midfielder, is paying the price for ditching Morocco’s national team, with some fans insulting and harassing the young player. In a recent interview with Foxsports, Ihattaren ruefully recounted one “sad” episode that took place at the airport in Eindhoven, the Dutch city whose team the young player represents at club level. According to Ihattaren, he was recently insulted and “verbally assaulted” by a considerable number of Moroccans while coming out of the airport. While many of the supporters were admirers of the player, some, even as they took selfies with him, told him he was a “traitor” for not choosing to play for Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Ihattaren told Foxsports that he tried to reason with some of his critics, explaining to them how he deeply loves Morocco and how his choice to represent the Netherlands was only “a sporting decision.” But they would not listen to Ihattaren’s defense. Instead, they allegedly reminded the player that his father, who recently died of cancer, would have been proud to have his son represent his country of origin. “Your father would have never allowed you to play for the Netherlands,” one of the angry fans allegedly told Ihattaren. The episode highlights the controversy that recently greeted the news that, after months of heated competition between Morocco’s Atlas Lions and the Netherlands’ Oranje to win over the promising attacking midfielder, the youngster chose his adoptive country over his “fatherland.” “I played for the Netherlands for the under 14s [team] and I won the European Championship with the Under-17 team with the Oranje. It’s good that I can continue,” Ihattaren explained as he announced his final decision last month. Amid mounting controversies in the weeks that followed that announcement, however, and with Moroccans keen to know the details of Ihattaren’s choice, the Ihattaren family eventually explained that Morocco’s footballing authority, the Royal Moroccan Federation of Football, had gone unacceptably far in their bid to convince Ihattaren. “They came at my father’s funerals to discuss my brother’s national team choice. This was a sad day reserved for condolences. That is why we chose to distance ourselves from these people,” Yassine, the player’s big brother, insisted in an interview with Dutch outlet AD on November 23. For critics—mostly disgruntled Atlas Lions fans—however, Ihattaren remains “just another sellout” who “betrayed” the motherland for the better prospects with the national team of his other country.

Rabat – Accounting firm KPMG published rankings of football players around the world according to their market value. In the Top 50 rankings, Moroccan international player Hakim Ziyech earned the 48th spot, with a value of € 69.5 million. KPMG published the rankings on December 11. The ranking is based on market studies to estimate the values of professional football players across the globe. Another Moroccan player figured on the rankings, this time in the Top 250. Achraf Hakimi, who plays for German club Borussia Dortmund, is the 225th most expensive player in the world, with an estimated value of € 35 million. The high estimated values of Ziyech, and Hakimi to a lesser extent, are well deserved. Both players are on the shortlist of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Awards 2019 and have been giving consistent performances on the international football scene this season. Many football experts consider Ziyech, currently playing for Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, as one of the best players in the world, with his accurate passes and his deep vision on the field. Many big European clubs have been soliciting the 26-year-old’s services in recent months, including Germany’s Bayern Munchen, England’s Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspurs, and Spain’s Real Madrid and Sevilla. Hakimi is also considered one of the most promising players in the world. At only 21 years old, the Moroccan prodigy is giving spectacular performances with his German club, leading him to qualify out of a difficult group in the European Champions League. Real Madrid, Hakimi’s childhood team, is trying hard to bring back the Moroccan player to the Spanish capital. The list of teams hoping to sign Hakim include England’s Chelsea as well as other big names in Europe. Other African names that appeared on KPMG’s ranking are Egypt’s Mohamed Salah, with an estimated value of € 150 million, and Senegal’s Sadio Mane, at € 130 million. The Top 10 of the ranking is as follows: In a new article, based on our updated players’ value estimates, we have prepared the list of the top 10 players according to absolute market value 💰 Liverpool striker Sadio Mané is a new joiner to this elite, and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba dropped out of the top 10 ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/pd25pNarKM — KPMG Football Benchmark (@Football_BM) December 11, 2019

Rabat – The Minister of Solidarity, Social Development, Equality and the Family, Jamila El Moussali has presented the government’s actions and measures aimed to enable people with disabilities in accessing their fundamental rights in the fields of education and teaching. Speaking at a national meeting on the International Day of Disabled Persons, El Moussali said that the provision of support for the disabled in Morocco is dependent on the provision of know-how, training, and knowledge in the field. The minister recalled that the first national qualification program for professionals in the care of people with autism “Rafik” is in the implementation phase. The program aims to provide support to people diagnosed with autism in their education, training, and qualification by qualified practitioners in place. El Moussali added that the program intends to qualify 3600 practitioners, including professionals and families, noting that a first group of 60 managers was set up in 2019, while two more groups are set to be formed within the next two years. The meeting also focused on “accessible cities,” the national program aiming to set up physical accessibility in the most important Moroccan cities, to develop a normative and regulatory framework governing the sector, capacity building in terms of accessibility for actors of local authorities, and raising awareness on the importance of accessibility. To support disabled people technically, the government has signed 13 local agreements with local authorities and associations in order to develop public spaces with accessibility, according to plans adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. The top official noted that the year 2018 saw the recruitment of 50 disabled people, while the government is preparing a contest to hire a further 200 people in state posts. Subsidies from the Fund for Social Cohesion dedicated to people with disabilities reached MAD 508.36 million from 2015 to 2018, with 15,000 beneficiaries in education and 1,207 beneficiaries in projects generating income. In the meeting, the minister and attendees also paid tribute to sportsmen with disabilities for their individual or collective achievements in international competitions.

Rabat – A Moroccan parliamentary delegation led by the President of the House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, has travelled to the French capital to take part in the 4th France-Morocco parliamentary forum. The forum kicked off on Friday, December 13, at the headquarters of the French National Assembly in Paris. Richard Ferrand, President of the National Assembly, chaired the opening session of the meeting, along with Gerard Larcher, President of the French Senate, Habib El Malki, and the first Deputy-Speaker of the House of Advisers, Abdessamad Kayouh. French and Moroccan members of parliament attended the event, as well as Morocco’s ambassador to France, Chakib Benmoussa. The participants are set to discuss the global challenges for parliamentary diplomacy, the means to preserve seas and oceans in the face of climate change, and the consolidation of democracy. Other topics of discussion at the event include the French-Moroccan partnership for security and development in Africa. The France-Morocco parliamentary forum is a biennial event, launched in 2013. It brings together parliamentary deputies from the two countries and takes place in Morocco and France, alternately. The forum aims to strengthen consultation and cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries. It is also an example of the strong partnership between Morocco and France. Since Morocco’s independence in 1956, relations between France and Morocco have been amicable, with a foundation in trade and tourism. France is one of Morocco’s primary trade partners and is also the main creditor and foreign investor in the Kingdom. On July 14, a national holiday in France known as Bastille Day, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that France and Morocco are “exceptional” friends. He added that the two countries have always been supportive of each other’s agenda on issues of “particular importance” for their “national causes.”

“Never let the fear of poverty stop you from following your dreams. Always have humility when approaching a potentially novel idea. Never stop asking questions, because the first step to knowledge is the good question. Ideas don’t fall from the sky, they come from the passion to investigate and search for the truth.” These inspirational words come from Youssef El Azouzi, a Moroccan doctor who defied all obstacles to become the best inventor in the Arab world, with a groundbreaking invention to help patients suffering from cardiac diseases. On Friday, November 8, Doctor El Azouzi won the Grand Final of Arab Stars of Science Season 11, a television show dedicated to Arab youth who feel they can develop technology that will improve the lives of their communities. A couple of weeks after his feat, Dr El Azouzi opened up to Morocco World News sharing his story, plans, and ambitions. A curious child The 27-year-old doctor was born in Rabat to a Moroccan father and an American mother. Growing up in a mixed household gave El Azouzi a unique perspective on social issues and interactions. Throughout his childhood in the Moroccan capital, El Azouzi developed a faculty for observing details and for questioning his surroundings even at the most basic level. “I was fascinated by maps and was obsessed with networks of transportation, be it roads, rails or sea routes. In fact, I had a world map right next to where I would lie on my bed and I would contemplate and study the map for an extended period of time. To put it simply, I was always interested in mobility from point A to point B,” he says. Despite being a curious and smart child, El Azouzi’s interests did not earn him outstanding grades at school. The scientist explained that this was due to the incompatibility of the Moroccan education system with creativity and innovation. “I was almost always an average student in terms of grades and did not fit into the stereotype most people would have regarding the best Arab inventor,” El Azouzi begins. “The reason why I never felt comfortable with the schooling system during my adolescence was because of the box I was being forced to fit into from an intellectual perspective. When I would learn about a certain subject I was interested in, I wouldn’t want to move on to the next subject as is done at school. I wanted to delve more into the abyss of whatever I was learning with one question leading me to another. This is what gave me a sense of pleasure and that’s all that mattered to me,” he explains. “I like helping others” At 18 years old, El Azouzi decided to become a doctor. His father, who is also a doctor, encouraged him after a discussion on the positive impact doctors can have on the society. Being a good listener and a person who enjoys helping others also played a role in his decision to enter the world of medicine. When he started his medical career, his childhood curiosity and interest in mobility sparked even brighter. The young doctor wanted to solve mobility problems within the human body, specifically issues related to moving blood from one area to another. The numerous questions that haunted El Azouzi’s mind led him to start conceptualizing his dream of helping people into inventions. The invention that earned El Azouzi the title of Best Arab Inventor was a flow modulation stent. In simpler words, it is a tiny tube that redirects blood flow that normally goes to the legs and diverts it towards the kidneys. El Azouzi’s invention will help patients suffering from heart failure by redistributing blood supply in the whole body. “Unlike current solutions to advanced-stage heart failure, our stent doesn’t require open and invasive surgery, doesn’t require the maintenance of a battery, and is expected to be less than one fourth the cost of an artificial heart pump implantation procedure,” said El Azouzi about what makes his invention unique. The Stars of Science Journey After creating a prototype of his invention, El Azouzi travelled to Silicon Valley, California, to find investors to fund his project. After more than 50 days of seeking funds, and almost losing hope, the Moroccan doctor found out about the Stars of Science show from someone he had met accidentally. “I had no idea about [the show], but when I went back home and saw the contestants of Season 9 and what support the program provides in terms of funds and technical help, I applied to the program within less than a week,” El Azouzi tells MWN. ”It’s interesting how my trip to the US, which lasted for about 50 days, was saved by a suggestion that lasted for a mere five minutes,” narrates the doctor. El Azouzi was confident enough that his project would qualify for the 11th season of Stars of Science. However, the young Moroccan had doubts about how far he would go “given the sheer number of contestants who were, not only specialists in their fields, but also published many papers in prestigious journals.” During the competition, the contestant had to go through four different phases: the proof of concept phase, the engineering phase, the design phase, and the testing phase. First, El Azouzi and the other competitors had to demonstrate their concepts using basic tools to convince the jury. Then, in the engineering phase, participants had to prove the efficacy and functionality of their concepts in more concrete terms and with more details. After that, the contestants demonstrated how their products would satisfy the customer or patient in the design phase. Finally, in the testing phase, El Azouzi and other finalists had to put their inventions to the test in real-life situations. The more El Azouzi advanced in the competition, the more confidence he gained, until he was named winner of the competition. One person that helped boost the young doctor’s self-confidence was his wife. “I had an early feeling that if I did reach the finals, I would likely take second or third place. However, my wife always had an instinctive feeling that I would come first and that’s exactly what ended up happening,” said El Azouzi recalling his achievement. So.. What next? The next phase in El Azouzi’s project is testing prototypes of his invention on animals, and then, ultimately, making the first trial on a human. “This is our ultimate aim – to clinically validate our hypothesis in a human model in order to demonstrate to the scientific community around the world that this device can make a difference in people’s lives,” explains the doctor. The inventor expects this testing phase to be completed in 12 to 18 months, with a total investment of up to one million dollars. As for his personal plans, the doctor wants to live in Morocco, at least until the testing phase is over. “I would like to avoid moving my family to another country on a permanent basis because there is still significant risk regarding the success of my project. This is why I have made the decision to live in Morocco on a permanent basis during the proof of concept phase of my project,” he explains. However, El Azouzi doesn’t reject the possibility of living abroad in the future. “In the future, once the prospects of my project appear more secure, I may move my family to where I deem is compatible for the growth and success of this project as well as my family’s well being.”

Rabat – Technology corporation Apple posted gallery photos on Instagram of Amazigh (Berber) women captured with the camera of the iPhone 11 Pro with the new feature “Deep Fusion.”  Commissioned by Apple, photographer Robbie Lawrence commented on Apple’s Instagram gallery, “The workshops of the Amazigh women provided a deep, low light that reminded me of Baroque period paintings. I was able to capture intimate details with the incredible depth and quality allowed by Deep Fusion.  Not only did Lawrence focus on the details of the Amazigh women, but of handicrafts, textiles, and Berger rugs as well.  Deep Fusion is available through the camera application of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone Pro Max. According to Apple, with this new feature, the camera can capture sharper photos when zoomed in on the image. The textures and minute details of the subject are enhanced, much like the clothes worn by the Amazigh women.

Rabat – Stepping off the train in Fez, I asked the locals if they were looking forward to the first annual National Festival of Heritage and Aissaoui Art. However, I did not receive the enthusiastic smiles that I was expecting. Instead, I was met with blank stares and hesitant questions.“What festival? Aissawa? I haven’t heard of any festival… in Fez?”  Trying to jog their memories, I showed them the festival’s poster with the location “I don’t know where that is. Are you sure it exists?”  I couldn’t hide my surprise and disappointment: In one of the largest cities in Morocco, the city that nurtured the very spiritual roots of Aissaoui art, nobody seemed to have heard of the festival. Perhaps I had got the date wrong.  After hours of weaving my way through the winding, intricate streets of Fez, I began to second-guess myself. The doubting words of the locals stuck in my mind; maybe there was no festival at all. As the sun melted into the city, I stumbled upon chaotic traffic with cars hunting for parking. Police lights flashed on security guards who were waving hundreds of people into a large white building. Men in button downs, women in dresses, children in buckled shoes gathered outside while tourists and professional photographers lit up the night with white camera flashes.  I noticed the same festival poster that I had in my pocket hanging from the windows. I arrived, relieved, at the new community center in Ville Nouvelle where the festival very clearly existed.  Attendees swarmed around two small tents outside the building, sampling tea, coffee, and soup. I stood watching children running against the flow of people in a game of tag while their mothers sat, enthralled in conversation, with mugs warming their hands.  Inside, the buzz of chatter carried over rows upon rows of occupied chairs, I sitting among them. Heads turned impatiently toward the entrance, I thought they were looking for family and friends or to glance at those left standing, hovering over seats that were filled. They were, in fact, waiting with bated breath for the start of the performance behind them, not in front of them on an empty stage.  Led by a dancer carrying a large, golden censer on his head, the unforgettable nasally sound of horns, and energetic drumming proceeded from an adjacent hall. In a line, the musicians pushed through crowds who were eagerly snapping photos and bending over each other to catch a video of the performers dressed in traditional orange and white.     It was ecstasy in its purest form. The audience cheered, yelled throughout the performances clapping and waving their arms to the music. If it wasn’t for security constantly telling people to sit down, the building would have collapsed from the hundreds of people belting out songs of praise and jumping to their feet to dance. One man was escorted out for what I believe to have been over-excitement.  The energy exchanged between the performers and the audience spiraled around and around, and just as I thought the music could not get any louder, the horns wormed their way through my ears, my heart beating by the deep resonance of the drum. Aissawa music aims to be meditative and spiritual and I, along with the rest of the room, was in a trance; including the sleeping baby next to me.                                                                               Leader of the Fassi Issaoui (Aissaoui) Community, Imad Oudghiri told Morocco World News that this festival seeks to revive the pure “Aissawa art, without adding any grainy” material. He added that there are other Aissaoui festivals in Casablanca, Rabat, and Meknes, but the authentic Aissawa style is never preserved. His aim was more than achieved. Aissawa music has gradually morphed its traditions over years of evolution. Once celebrated for spiritual enhancement and meditative purposes, it has slowly been forgotten. This festival was the first to uproot Aissawa’s origins and reach a wide audience through “authentic” and “pure” traditions. According to one attendee, “It is nice to see that Aissawa music is not forgotten…people still want to keep it alive as a tradition.”  But, is a tradition truly forgotten if people as eager as those who attended the festival cherish and celebrate it as much as they did? As demonstrated by the festival, I believe a tradition is kept alive by one’s valued experiences and yearning to share it with others.  As I wandered within the walls of an ancient city, I questioned the existence of the Aissawa festival, but now I am sure that a tradition this close to people’s hearts will always exist.

Rabat – The United Nations General Assembly adopted a  resolution on December 13 approved by the 4th Committee last October. The resolution adopted without a vote reiterates the assembly’s support for the UN-led political process to settle the regional dispute over Western Sahara. The resolution calls on all parties to fully cooperate with the UN Secretary-General to achieve a political solution to this regional dispute. The adopted resolution also supports the  political process based on UN Security Council resolutions since 2007 to reach a just, durable, and mutually acceptablepolitical solution to the conflict. The text of the resolution also commends the efforts made to solve the conflicts, calling on all parties to fully cooperate with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as well as with each other to find a “political solution that is mutually acceptable.” The UNGA also acknowledged that the parties in the conflict are committed to continuing to show political will.  The parties demonstrate their ability to work in an “atmosphere propitious for dialogue, on the basis of efforts made and new facts since 2006, thus ensuring the implementation of the Security Council’s resolutions since 2007.” The resolution, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), expresses the support of the UNGA to resolutions of the Security Council since 2007, “which stressed the pre-eminence of the autonomy initiative presented by Morocco, hailed by the executive body and the entire international community as a serious and credible initiative for the final settlement of this regional dispute.” The UNGA’s text also expressed support for the recommendations of the Security Council Resolution 2440 and 2468, adopted respectively in October 2018 and April 2019, and supported by resolution 2494 dated October 30, 2019. The said resolutions, MAP added, set the parameters of the solution to the regional dispute over the Western Sahara, particularly a political, realistic, pragmatic, and durable solution of compromise. The resolution also recalled the efforts of the former Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, who convened the parties to the conflict in two roundtables in December 2018 and March 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. Resolutions 2440, 2468, and 2494 of the UN Security Council fostered the round-table process and specified the parties to the conflict: Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario. Resolutions 2468 and 2494 cite Algeria five times similarly to Morocco. These Security Council resolutions also welcome the measures and initiatives taken by Morocco to promote and protect human rights in its southern provinces. Additionally, the resolutions welcomethe role played by the National Council of Human Rights committees in Laayoune and Dakhla, as well as Morocco’s interaction with the UNHRC mechanisms. The resolutions also reiterate the UN request for the registration and census of populations in the Tindouf camps, and call for making the necessary efforts to this end. Resolutions 2414 (April 2018), 2440, 2468, and 2494 enjoined the Polisario to withdraw from the Guergarate buffer zone and to cease all destabilizing actions east of the defense structure in Western Sahara, and to refrain from any action likely to undermine the UN political process.

Rabat – American travel magazine “Big 7 Travel” published an article about the 50 friendliest cities in the world. Morocco’s largest and most crowded city, Casablanca, earned the 49th spot on the list. “With a thriving market square that’s home to the city’s Medina, it’s easy to get lost here, but residents will show you around (just don’t expect that guide to be for free). Casablanca has a great atmosphere, but be aware of pickpockets,” wrote the magazine. The online publication made the list based on reviews from readers. The criteria taken into consideration included the difficulty of navigating the streets, strangers’ readiness to help, and how easy it is to make new friends. Casablanca is the largest city in Morocco and in the Maghreb region. It is also the eighth-largest city in the Arab world. The magazine’s ranking may seem weird to Moroccans, as “friendliness” would be low on the list of their first thoughts about Casablanca. “Crowded” or “noisy” is the general consensus about life in the metropolis. Other cities from the Arab world that made it to the rankings are Muscat, Oman, ranked 18th, and Abu Dhabi, UAE, in the 13th position. Vancouver, Canada, earned the title of friendliest city in the world, according to the magazine, followed by Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Bruges in Belgium, Taipei in Taiwan, and Hamburg in Germany. Big 7 Travel is an online US magazine that specializes in travel. The publication has a team that reviews hotels, restaurants, cafes, bars, and tourist spots all over the world.

Rabat – Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah Al Saud has spoken warmly of Morocco’s efforts to shed light on the Palestinian cause. Al Saud is part of a Saudi delegation that arrived in Morocco to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Thursday, December 12, in Rabat. The Saudi diplomat recalled that OIC seeks primarily to support the struggle of the Palestinian people to “restore their stolen rights, against racial discrimination, and to support international peace and security based on rights and justice.” The Saudi diplomat reaffirmed the positions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its permanent “endeavor to strengthen and enhance the work of the organization, and support joint Islamic action with member states and the General Secretariat to achieve the hopes and aspirations of the peoples” of the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia and Morocco share similar aspirations, with King Mohammed VI also emphasizing the importance of the Palestinian cause for Rabat. In a message addressed to the attendees of the symposium, the monarch called on the international community to increase efforts to grant Palestinians the right to an independent state with east Jerusalem as its capital. King Mohammed VI also renewed the “constant commitment” of Morocco to defend Jerusalem and Palestine and “to preserve the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, by all political, diplomatic legal means and by all possible forms of mobilization on the ground.”

Rabat – International NGO Climate Chance for observing non-state climate action has showcased two Moroccan initiatives in its 2019 synthesis report. The climate policy in the region of Souss-Massa, central Morocco, and a sustainable semi-Olympic swimming pool in Marrakech both appear in the report. The observatory presented the region of Souss-Massa as a case study and analyzed its climate policy governance and integration. “The Local Plan to Combat Climate Change (PTRC) of the Souss-Massa region, is the first local climate plan of all Morocco that has operationalised at a regional level the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (SNDD),” says the report. The plan “outlines climate vulnerabilities and formulates the region’s first greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory.” The plan also “provides a ‘bank’ of mitigation and adaptation projects representing a total investment of €2.98 billion,” notes the document. In terms of GHG tracking, the report presents statistics about energy emissions in the region. Transport causes 45% of GHG emissions, followed by building (27%), agriculture (15%), and industry (10%). The plan aims to reduce GHG emissions in the region by 75% by 2030, adds the report. “To reach its goals, the Souss-Massa region focuses mainly on the decarbonation of its energy mix and its sunlight rate which is one of the highest of the Kingdom. The solar potential is added onto wind potential on the seafront,” explains the publication. The report also lists some of the pilot projects in the region such as the development of photovoltaic potential maps by the Ibn Zohr University and the Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), and the development of solar ovens to reduce the use of wood for cooking in rural households. The observatory report featured the Abdelmoumen dam pumping energy transfer station and the Noor Tata solar power plant. The Souss-Massa region is home to more than 2.7 million Moroccans, representing 600,000 families. Its economy is heavily based on agriculture, and tourism as a secondary sector. The second project worth noting, according to the observatory, is the Sidi Youssef semi-Olympic swimming pool in Marrakech. The building respects both “international swimming standards and sustainability principles.” The Ministry of Youth and Sports decided to use timber in the construction of the pool to reduce the use of concrete. The building also has an insulated roof and external walls, eco-friendly heat pumps and 12 solar panels. The design of showerheads and sinks reduces water consumption. “The building’s overall GHG emissions amount to 5.48 kgCO2/ m²/year (traditional pools emit on average 6.25 kgCO2/ m²/year),” says the report. The international recognition from the observatory consolidates Morocco’s vision of sustainable development and its role as a regional leader in terms of renewable energy.

Rabat – The Japanese government has granted Morocco a donation consisting of ophthalmological and optical equipment to support a campaign against blindness. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the Japanese government granted the donation to the Moroccan Association for the Prevention of Blindness as part of a non-reimbursable aid program for local micro-projects contributing to human security (APL). The grant is estimated at around MAD 500,000 ($52,177). The Japanese government gave the grant for the acquisition of a non-mydriatic retinography, an automatic refractometer, a slit lamp, an automatic front oometer, a test screen and an automatic grinder scanner, a statement from the Japanese Embassy in Morocco said on Thursday, December 12. The embassy emphasized that the donation is testament to the relations of friendship and cooperation between Morocco and Japan. It also aims to “strengthen the ophthalmic consultation unit for the benefit of the Moroccan Association for the Prevention of Blindness” in Rabat The equipment will allow the “consolidation of diagnostic and screening activities and services offered to thousands of people annually,” the statement added. Japan, a country that shares strong bilateral relations with Morocco,  has made numerous donations to finance several sustainable development projects in Morocco as part of the APL program. The Japanese government created the program in 1989. The initiative mainly provides support for local communities and NGOs to provide financial aid to development projects, the statement added.

Rabat – A recent UN report called for a number of changes to the Moroccan penal code, high among the recommendations is the criminalization of marital rape. Other suggestions included criminalizing sexual harassment, both in public places and on social media, enforcing the laws on violence against women, revising family laws, and repealing provisions that exonerate offenders if they marry the woman they raped or kidnapped. “Morocco’s Law on Violence against Women, Law no. 103-13, did not amend the Penal Code provision on rape, which does not list marriage among aggravating circumstances for sentencing rape offenders. In addition, prosecutions are not reported,” says the report. The document tackled several flaws in the Moroccan penal code that are hindering the country from reaching its gender equality goals. Despite the laws protecting women from discrimination and violence being in line with global standards, Morocco needs to enforce and adapt them for social justice, according to the report. The report criticized Morocco’s abortion laws. In Morocco, “abortion is legal only where it is necessary to save a woman’s life. Abortion on demand is prohibited by penal codes.” The study also denounced the effectiveness of Moroccan laws to prevent child marriage. Despite the 2004 Family Code criminalizing the marriage of Moroccan citizens under the age of 18, child marriage is still prevalent, especially in rural areas, the report notes. The Regional Bureau for Arab States affiliated to the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published the report entitled “Gender Justice &amp; Equality before the law” on Tuesday, December 10. UNDP prepared the report in collaboration with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and UN Women. Despite Morocco’s ongoing efforts to promote gender equality and prevent violence and discrimination against women, reports show that these issues remain widespread within Moroccan society. A recent report from Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) showed that more than 7.6 million women in Morocco have experienced at least one act of violence in the last 12 months. The figure represents 57% of Morocco’s female population. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Higher Council of the Ulema (Islamic scholars) responded to the ongoing public debate about abortion‒one of the issues that need legal reform, according to the UN report. The council affirmed that any amendments to abortion laws in Morocco’s penal code will be based on “ijtihad,” an independent interpretation of religious texts that is up-to-date with present social contexts. The announcement could be a way to lay the ground for upcoming amendments to the penal code without deviating from religious laws, international human rights lawyer Stephanie Willman Bordat told Morocco World News.

Rabat – The Gambian government has announced its decision to open a consulate in Dakhla, Western Sahara “in the near future.” Morocco considers Dakhla part of its sovereign territory. Gambian minister of foreign affairs Mamadou Tangara said on December 12 at a press briefing in Rabat that his country is discussing the “ upcoming opening of a consulate of the Republic of the Gambia” in Dakhla. The Gambian minister had a meeting with the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, during which both officials spoke about their countries’ determination to strengthen bilateral ties. The Gambian official said that the opening of this consulate will take place “as soon as possible.” “We will work together to give concrete substance to the visions of our two heads of state,” he added. The official also reiterated Gambia’s position and support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. He also thanked Morocco for supporting Gambia in “difficult times.” Yangara is part of a Gambian delegation who arrived in Morocco recently to take part in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Bourita also spoke at the press briefing, emphasizing that the talks with his Gambian counterpart served as an opportunity to “recall the commitment” of King Mohammed VI to develop a south-south cooperation with Gambia. Bourita also recalled the royal visit of the monarch in 2006. He said that the visit was an event to “lay the foundations for this solid partnership, which is growing stronger today.” In addition to Gambia, several other countries also expressed willingness to open consulates in Morocco’s southern provinces of Laayoune and Dakhla. Last month, Comores made similar statement of determination to open a consulate in Morocco’s Laayoune. The announcement comes only six months after the opening of Cote d’Ivoire’s honorary consulate in Laayoune in June.

Rabat – The electoral commission in Algeria announced today, December 13, that Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Algeria’s former Prime Minister, has won the country’s presidential election. Tebboune won the election with a majority of 58% of the vote, meaning that there will be no second round of the election. The electoral body announced that turnout was very low with only 40% this year. Deposed Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sacked Tebboune as prime minister in 2017, only three months after he was appointed. Bouteflika sacked Tebboune for his alleged public criticism of the Algerian presidency. Political observers predicted  Tebboune’s win as he is backed by the army. The army, however, vowed to not interfere in the election. Tebboune, 74,  previously served as Minister of Housing from 2001 to 2002 and again from 2012 to 2017. The election took place in a tense climate, with Algerian protesters strongly criticizing the army for imposing the ballots at a critical time. Protesters have been rallying in Algeria since February after the former president announced his decision to run for a fifth term. The decision did not go unnoticed, with thousands of Algerians calling for his departure along with the elites of his regime. The protests resulted in his resignation, with several other officials following. The protests continued with people calling for the interim government as well as the army chief Gaid Salah to step down from power. Masses of voters in Algeria also boycotted the presidential election, with clashes erupting between demonstrators and the security services. After Bouteflika’s resignation, the military tried to regain control of the population and pushed for a presidential election to resolve the political crisis. Ahmed Gaid Salah, Algeria’s army chief and de facto ruler, said that opponents of the elections are “a criminal gang full of bitterness and visceral hate for this country.” He also ordered security forces to stop any disturbances of the elections. Despite calls for reforms and radical change, a Bouteflika-era official won the election. It remains to be seen whether protesters will accept Tebboune’s election or will continue their calls for new faces in government.

Rabat – One cannot help but be aware of the positive results of moral and psychological motivation, and about the relationship between optimism and positivity, and one’s achievements, breakdowns and realized goals. It is also common to hear about the role of self-confidence, and confidence in our surroundings, in making individual decisions and in the ability to reach goals and face challenges. The idea of positivity and hope as a motivational, inspirational force may be behind the choice of intellectuals, philosophers, artists, and moviemakers to bend and enhance reality in their work about realistic social topics. Artists inject reality with extra doses of hope and do not focus too long on the shortfalls and issues that mark everyday life. They focus, instead, on the glass half full aspects, and on giving a little hope in the middle of darkness, as well as on proving the importance of clinging to the light at the end of the long dark tunnel. Some countries have chosen to promote the importance of spreading hope, of collective trust, of competitiveness in ethics, creativity and originality, and of creating mechanisms to fight a rentier economy. These countries directed their legislative bodies and media away from the spread of dependency, dark thoughts, and the culture of defeatism and living off others’ mistakes. This direction has led to the creation of unique ministries such as the ministries of happiness, social happiness,  women, talent, unity and tolerance. The countries supported this direction with the promotion of cultural festivals and exhibiting human values through annual programs of cultural and artistic activities. However, this does not mean that there should be no critical readings of reality or objective diagnoses. Analyses and interpretations should not be based on conspiracy theories and should not make accuse those who see the world with a clear, objective eye of treason. What is needed is constructive criticism, a perspective and analysis that hopes for a better life and future, with social justice, development, and an investment climate to provide good living conditions for our people. This constructive criticism is a form of responsible criticism without self-flagellation. The constant negative chatter and negative backbiting in Morocco have reached unprecedented levels, levels that belie a blocked horizon and a lack of hope. This recent trend in Morocco is spreading one way of thinking manifested in criticism for the sake of criticism and spreading a culture of defeatism and predicting a dark future. The observation prompts questions about the real reasons and motives behind encouraging this form of criticism instead of another, about the parties gaining interests in painting the walls of Morocco’s future in black, and about their role in imposing one thought model and one image of reality. However, rejecting criticism for criticism’s sake is not an invitation to beautify reality and falsify its components. My motives are purely nationalistic and my aim to create the atmosphere for a public discussion that doesn’t sweep towards populism and empty propaganda. It is true that Morocco, like any country in the world, suffers from weaknesses and obstacles. It is not a secret revealed for the first time. Some royal speeches and messages diagnosed reality in all clarity and smoothness by calling things by their names. They shed light on corruption, rentier economy, bribery, and precarity. Still, they also presented visualizations and scenarios to get out of the bottleneck through urgent strategic plans that show confidence in individuals and institutions. This constructive criticism carries with it a message of belief in oneself and in the society, helping to overcome difficult challenges and gain trust in Moroccan people. My speech about Moroccan people is far from exaggerated or distanced from reality. It is an objective and realistic discourse, based on the achievements of Moroccans throughout history and their contributions to humanity. The dialogue on Morocco is also based on media reports and the way the country is seen from the outside. It echoes the reports we receive from abroad about the success and achievements of young Moroccans. The Moroccans we hear about in the news graduated from public schools and were born to Moroccan families, both average families and rich ones. However, they were determined to excel and to prove their talents and strengths in different international contexts. In recent years, Moroccans have splashed across newspaper pages and online publications and appeared on the covers of international magazines. Therefore, we have to notice them, praise their achievements, and use them as a motivation tool for younger generations, and as a mirror to reflect the shining part of Moroccan society, despite all the hardships and difficulties. When the world speaks about young Moroccans’ achievements in complex scientific fields and sports competitions, intelligence, medicine, invention, creativity, or religious chanting, it represents an opportunity for us all. The opportunity is to develop and consolidate the positive image of Morocco that these young people have presented. The kingdom is making its way, with all determination, to achieve the climate for decent living and social justice. It is a country aware of its strengths and weaknesses, and it turns necessities into ingredients to overcome challenges. Mariam Amjoun, Fatima Akhyar, Lahcen Oulhaj, Youssef El Azzouzi, Amina Demnati, Fatima Amkha, Driss Benali, Amine Driouch, Abdeljalil Bousski, and other Moroccans living in Morocco or abroad, such as Rachid Yazami, Kamal Oudghiri, and Laila Alami, all represent a different reading of Moroccan society. They are the ingredients of a shining image of the future. A number of these young men and women were not born with a silver spoon in their mouths. They are people who believed in their skills, gained confidence in themselves and their surroundings, met challenges and defeated all obstacles. They used their intelligence to cut out a path towards success and glory. We might feel sometimes that there are invisible hands that want to drown us with destructive thoughts and spread negative ideas in the souls of youth through anchoring ideas such as “Motribo al-hay la yotrib” (The singer of the neighborhood doesn’t sing, meaning that someone who keeps on doing the same thing ends up losing its effect) or “Makaynch m3amn” (Nobody is with us, nobody will support us). However, hope for a better future rises again when seeing young Moroccans turning into shining stars in the skies of science, arts, sports, and culture.

Rabat – The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has added Morocco’s traditional Gnawa to the list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (ICH) on December 12. The UNESCO added the Moroccan centuries-old music after Morocco submitted a file nominating Gnawa to the ICH Service in september 2018. Gnawa music infuses poetry and traditional music along with dancing. Performers takes you to a spiritual journey with the rhythm, adorned by the famous genburi, an instrument with three strings. The rhythm is incomplete without the steel castanets called “krakebs” or “karkabat.” Morocco’s nomination file, published by UNESCO, stipulated that the Gnawa, “especially in the city, practise a therapeutic possession ritual through all-night rhythm and trance ceremonies combining ancestral African practices, Arab-Muslim influences and native Berber cultural performances.” The description added that the art is a “sufi brotherhood music” with lyrics of religious content. The nomination file emphasized that Morocco considers the art as part of its culture and identity. The music exists in every region in Morocco, but it is mostly common in Morocco’s old medinas, including Rabat, Sale, Fez, Marrakech, and Essaouira. The art has also become very common in music festivals across the country, with an exclusive annual international festival The Gnawa International Festival taking place in Essaouira every summer. Gnawa performers make the art vivid with their loose colorful dresses and hats decorated with false braids. The band is divided to several subgroups, with the master of the group leading the music and the rhythm. The band consists of the dancers, who can jump higher with the rhythm and Karekabs, as well as the chorus performers, andthe master or M’alam. “The number of fraternal groups and master musicians is constantly growing in Morocco’s villages and major cities, and Gnawa groups – organized into associations – hold local, regional, national and international festivals year-round,” Morocco’s nomination file reads. This is not the first time for Morocco has submitted a nomination file to inscribe Gnawa on UNESCO’s ICH list. Neila Tazi, the head organizer of the Gnawa and World Music Festival, made a first attempt previously. She said that the “file [was] quite complex to build and we now wait on our Ministry of Culture and our delegation to UNESCO to help us make it.”

Marrakech – The Policy Center for the New South (PCNS), a Rabat-based think-tank, celebrated the launch of its 8th Atlantic Dialogues session on Thursday, December 12 in Marrakech. The three-day conference, led by established experts in various fields, will focus on leadership, entrepreneurship, and innovative policymaking.  The conference brings together senior officials, business leaders, academics, researchers, entrepreneurs, civil servants, and civil society actors to engage in high-level dialogue. Atlantic Currents: The South in the time of turmoil The dialogues kicked off on Thursday morning with a multi-faceted discussion of the period of turmoil that currently envelops the Global South.  The panel members included Anabel Gonzalez, the former Minister of Foreign Trade of Costa Rica; Len Ishmael, a senior fellow at the PCNS; Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the PCNS; Olisaeloka Okocha, managing partner and co-founder of PS Nutraceuticals International; and former Prime Minister of Senegal Aminata Toure. Panel members touched on a wide range of subjects including trade, terrorism, US foreign policy, agriculture, youth, immigration, and climate change.  While four of the panelists analyzed the factors contributing to the South’s current state of turmoil, former Prime Minister of Senegal Aminata Toure took the opportunity to remind her colleagues and the audience that the African continent has much to be proud of.  “We do have a lot of things to celebrate,” she stated. “The countries that were seen as hopeless are emerging in strong ways.” The former prime minister noted economic growth, improved social indicators such as gender equality in education access, improved access to drinkable water, and higher life expectancies. Toure did, however, highlight the importance of collaborating to effectively address security, a point that her fellow panelists reiterated as the discussion continued.   “We are in turmoil, but at the same time, we are seeing great areas of optimism and progress,” Toure stated. “How can we mitigate the [negatives] and increase the [positives]?” Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo talks multilateralism Olusegun Obasanjo, former president of Nigeria, lead the conference’s official opening conversation alongside American journalist and news anchor Richard Lui. The duo engaged in a lively discussion of development on the African continent. Obasanjo shared a wealth of wisdom with the audience, but he maintained a consistent theme throughout each of his points: Optimism.  “We should not be entirely worried about the situation that we are in,” Obasanjo began.  “In the last century, within the first 40 years, there were two world wars. That gave the world a jitter,” he continued.  “The world was looking for peace, the world was looking for security, stability, development, growth, progress. To a large extent, all of these were achieved. “But we did not get multilateralism. What we got was two worlds. We got a bipolar world, not multilateralism,” argued Obasanjo. He went on to assure the South that although the world order as we know it is disappearing, “there is likely to be something better coming in.” “I believe it will be multilateralism, which is what we need,” he said confidently.   “The old order is in the process of changing,” he added. “Before you get the dawn, it gets a little bit darker. So what you are getting, which we call uncertainty, turmoil, I think we are there. But maybe we need to get that disruption, that change, for us to get a [new world order].” Plenary sessions The first plenary session at the 8th Atlantic Dialogues focused on the prospects for populism around the world.  The esteemed panel members included Maria Eugenia Brizuela de Avila, El Salvador’s former minister of foreign affairs; Ana Palacio, Spain’s former minister of foreign affairs; J. Peter Pham, the US special envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa; Paulo Portas, Portugal’s former minister of foreign affairs; and Ignacio Walker, Chile’s former minister of foreign affairs.  The policy experts each spoke of populism in their respective countries and regions.  Populism is a political approach based on the idea that society is separated into two polar groups characterized by “pure people” and “corrupt elite.” Populism strives to appeal to the masses, who feel as though their concerns are ignored by the established elite.   Populism is on the rise around the world, and populist parties can fall anywhere on the political spectrum and adapt to all political, social, and economic situations.  The panelists discussed the roots of populism in various countries, the conflicts that have emerged due to the rise of populist ideologies, and solutions to social unrest and violence around the world.           The second plenary session of the 8th Atlantic Dialogues dissected the education quandary afflicting Africa and the southern Atlantic region.  The panel gathered Didier Acouetey, president and founder of AfricSearch Group; the former Minister of Education of Nigeria Obiageli Katryn Ezekwesili; the former Minister of Economic Development and Planning of Vietnam Gregory Nguyen Tien Hung; and the former Minister for Education, Higher Education, and Research of France Najat Vallaud Belkacem. The panelists highlighted the issues of poverty, inequality, and gender that limit education for citizens of the global South. Ezekwesili, for her part, described some of the solutions used in Nigeria that can help remedy the education quandary throughout Africa.  Emerging leaders In addition to plenary sessions and expert dialogues, the conference hosts a network of 50 emerging leaders (ADELs) of 27 nationalities chosen for their initiative, leadership potential, vision, and ambition to strengthen transatlantic ties.  The objective of the ADEL program is to build a community that transcends the Atlantic Dialogues conference, according to PCNS. The community is an active body with frequent opportunities for ADELs and program alumni to network, engage in meaningful discussion, and collaborate with experts in their respective fields.  The closing plenary discussion of the conference will be dedicated to the new members of the ADEL network.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities have managed to rescue two men from Mount Tidghine in the Al Hoceima province after they lost their way during a snowstorm. Thursday, December 12 was not a good day for the two men called Ismael and Khaled. Luckily, access to the internet turned out to be life-saving. Khaled used Facebook to ask for help after he and his friend became stranded on the mountain.  “Please share this post widely. We are stuck in Mount Tidghine.. It is heavily snowing and we lost our way. It is almost night time. My friend Ismael is injured and he is bleeding. Please share this post,”  Khaled wrote on his Facebook.  In another post, Khaled said that they had been facing the harsh winter conditions for more than three hours. “Maybe it is our mistake because our hobby is trekking. Thank you very much for helping us and I am sorry to freak you out (…) I have done what I could. If we died here this is our fate,” he wrote emotionally.   Posted by Khaled Pa on Thursday, 12 December 2019 He said that he could not move because he would slip to the edge. “Please find a solution.” Social media users shared Khaled’s posts hundreds of times and offered messages of support. The decision to communicate the dire situation on social media helped alert the authorities who eventually rescued the men from certain death.

Rabat – Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said that his country’s position on the Western Sahara conflict is “very clear.” Speaking at a joint press conference with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on December 12, the Turkish official reiterated Turkey’s “full support” for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Cavusoglu explained that Turkish media giant TRT recent airing a pro-Polisario video clip on the Western Sahara conflict was a misunderstanding. The Turkish diplomat added that the “misunderstanding” has been “corrected.” Cavusoglu affirmed that the Turkish government does support any “separatist group or any agenda.” He stipulated that the Turkish state not only support the territorial integrity of Morocco, but also its stability and security. The Turkish official is part of a delegation that arrived in Morocco to take part in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) 50th anniversary in Rabat. In addition to the Western Sahara conflict, the Turkish official said that he discussed several common interests with Bourita during his visit to Morocco. Among the discussions was the Morocco-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. The Turkish official said that the country’s trade officials will come to Rabat at the end of the month to discuss the situation with Morocco. He added that he is “sure” that the two countries will reach an understanding regarding the situation. Rabat has recently expressed willingness to walk out of the Free Trade Agreement with Turkey as it does not benefit the North African country’s economy. It remains to be seen whether Turkey and Morocco will reach a deal to maintain the agreement.

Rabat – Former Moroccan Prime Minister and secretary of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) party, Abderrahmane Youssoufi, argued that it is necessary to provide the right conditions to achieve a “historic reconciliation with the Algerian brothers.” Youssoufi gave a speech at a conference organized by USFP in Oujda, northeastern Morocco, on Friday, December 6. The conference discussed the normalization of relations between Morocco and Algeria. The party held the conference in Oujda, 10 kilometers from the Algerian borders, because the city represents “a stronghold of common national resistance between the liberation movements in Morocco and Algeria,” according to Youssoufi. The former PM expressed his satisfaction with King Mohammed VI’s speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. On November 6, 2018, King Mohammed VI called for dialogue between the two nations on the possibility of reopening borders with Algeria to “serve the two peoples’ interests.” Youssoufi reiterated the King’s words saying that the two countries and their leaders are capable of opening a dialogue “without a third-party mediation,” and able to find solutions to all the issues complicating the Morocco-Algeria relations. The former politician believes that the King’s speech aimed to tackle the problems between the two countries and find solutions. “We are all supposed to participate in finding [solutions], because of our brotherhood and our common history,” said Youssoufi. The former USFP leader also expressed his expectations of the Arab Maghreb Union to “realize the hopes of [all five countries’] peoples.” However, the union has not yet met any of the expectations because of “several problems,” according to Youssoufi. At the end of his speech, Youssoufi recalled what the Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi once said about “the failing of the older generation to achieve the Greater Maghreb dream, and about his hopes in the newer generation [of politicians and diplomats] to reach it.” Relations between Morocco and Algeria have been dominated by several issues since their independence in 1956 and 1962, respectively. The most notable illustrations of the conflict are the 1963 Sand War, the Western Sahara War between 1975 and 1991, and the closing of the Algeria-Morocco borders in 1994. King Mohammed VI has called for a dialogue with Algeria in many of his recent speeches. In the 2019 Throne Day speech, on July 30, the King said that Morocco has reaffirmed its sincere commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the people of the two sister nations.” However, the offer for talks did not receive a response from Algeria with the country currently facing a political crisis.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP Foundation and the Ghanaian Ministry of Agriculture have launched a soil fertility project to address the challenges of food security and cultivated land preservation. The OCP and the Ghanaian institution launched the fertility map development project on December 1 in Accra. The project puts a central focus on capacity building for the ministry of food and agriculture staff (MoFA), providing laboratories with equipment, and developing a soil fertility map. The project seeks to provide farmers in Ghana with soil analysis tools. The OCP Foundation seeks to improve local crop yields and strengthen the scientific and technical skills of beneficiaries through the project. As part of the initiative, experts will analyze and map more than 100,000 hectares of soil in the pilot area, the Ashanti Region, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The OCP Foundation will also offer the MoFA staff the necessary equipment for its two specialized soil and fertilizer analysis laboratories, as well as a mobile soil analysis unit and pick-up trucks and motorcycles to reach the least accessible areas for soil sampling. Training sessions will be offered as part of the project. Experts from the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University will train more than 130 MoFA agronomists, engineers, laboratory technicians, and managers. Last month,  the OCP signed an agreement with the Spanish company Fertinagro Bitech and Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The agreement aims to endow the university to fund professors who will train researchers. The training sessions will include soil fertility and crop fertilization, geographic information systems (GIS) applied to soil mapping and fertilizer quality control. “Through this initiative, OCP Foundation remains committed to furthering the emergence of sustainable and resilient agriculture in Africa,” the foundation said. The OCP Foundation is present in Africa with several initiatives, seeking to promote the creation of strategic decision-making tools for agricultural policies.  “To date, more than one million hectares of land have been mapped, more than 240 staff members have been trained, and 14 laboratories have been upgraded,” according to the OCP. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, Minister of Food and Agriculture, Ms. Imane Ouaadil, Moroccan Ambassador to Ghana, senior Ghanaian officials, and Ghanaian farmers associations, as well as representatives of the national private sector and the fertilizer industry, attended the inauguration ceremony, a statement from the OCP said.

Rabat – Transparency International released yesterday, December 11, the results of the 2019 Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Middle East and North Africa. The survey examined citizens’ perceptions of electoral and government corruption in Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan, and Tunisia. While the report found that 53% of Moroccans believe that institutional corruption is increasing, the kingdom did rank lower than Tunisia where 67% of citizens see corruption as a growing problem. Sudan topped the ranking at 82% with Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon all appearing above Morocco on the list.  However, according to the survey, 74% of Moroccans believe that the government is not doing enough to tackle corruption and that politicians are actively involved in bribery and corrupt practice. Only Lebanon and Sudan ranked above Morocco, with 80% and 87% respectively. “The handling of corruption cases reveals a gap between leaders’ promises and real action. According to the GCB results, one in four Moroccans think most or all judges, magistrates and police are involved in corruption,” the Transparency International report outlines. The report went on to underline that: “With many court cases ignored by public authorities and some already drawn out judicial processes lengthened by unmotivated prosecutors, it is unsurprising to see why an overwhelming majority of citizens (74%) think that the government is not doing enough to tackle corruption and why 47% say they are not satisfied with the level of democracy in their country.” In the section of the report focussing on Morocco, Transparency International gives the case study of the Casino Es Saadi case. According to the report “a local government official was allegedly bribed to cheaply sell municipal land to a business.” “In 2015, after a trial in which Transparency Maroc, Transparency International’s chapter in Morocco, was a civil party, the official was sentenced to five years in prison.” An appeal is now in progress and the court has removed the original judges from the case. The focus on Morocco section concludes by emphasizing that: “By undermining the vital pillars of democracy, including the judicial system, corruption can produce a vicious cycle, where corruption weakens democratic institutions, and in turn, the institutions are less able to control corruption.” The report also examined bribery and found that 31% of Moroccan citizens have paid a bribe in the past 12 months. Compared to the rest of the MENA countries surveyed, Morocco fell in the middle. In Lebanon, 41% of citizens said they had paid a bribe, while in Jordan only 4% had paid bribes while using public services.  The results showed that across all countries surveyed, the police force was the most likely to take bribes. “The results show that the police have the highest bribery rate (22%) and are the public service most likely to demand and receive bribes,” the report outlined.  However, 49% of Moroccans believe that “ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.” In this section of the survey, Morocco fell behind Tunisia, Sudan, Palestine, and Jordan.  Across all of the countries surveyed, 58% believe reporting corruption in government or public service will lead to retaliation.  The report concludes by calling on MENA governments to “act and demonstrate serious political will against corruption.”  The international anti-corruption agency argued that: “Countries should fulfill their commitments to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) as a first step. In addition, strong and independent judicial systems, as well as the proper separation of powers, are needed to promote anti-corruption efforts.”

 Rabat – The Hirak (protest) movement in Algeria has called for a boycott of the presidential elections taking place today, December 12. According to the movement, the poll cannot be fair unless the ruling elite and the military give up their power. Thousands of Algerians decided to protest on the streets of several major Algerian cities, notably in Algiers, on the day of the elections. The demonstrations resulted in clashes with Algerian riot police, with police arresting dozens of protesters. The protesters rejected all five candidates running for presidency, calling them “children of the regime” and of the former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who resigned in April 2019 after widespread calls for him to step down. Experts predict a very low turnout for these elections, following the protests on the days leading up to the vote and the polling day itself. A video circulating on social media shows protesters breaking into a polling station and destroying the boxes containing ballots. الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام
الجزائري بدأ بصناديق الاقتراع Posted by GOUD on Thursday, 12 December 2019 It is not yet known which city the polling station was in. Despite the demonstrations, Mohamed Charfi, Algeria’s former justice minister and head of the electoral commission, said that 90% of polling stations are open and only 5% were affected by “disturbances.” Charfi also described turnout as “respectable” so far. The 61,000 polling stations across the country will close at 7 pm, local time. The electoral committee will announce the results tomorrow, December 13. The elected president will, however, struggle to achieve acceptance from the Algerian people. The protest movement in Algeria started in February 2019, in response to Bouteflika’s announcement that he planned to run for a fifth term in office. Since then, protesters organized demonstrations on a regular basis, calling for the abolishment of the system that had governed Algeria since its independence in 1962. After Bouteflika’s resignation, the military tried to regain control of the population and pushed for a presidential election to resolve the political crisis. Ahmed Gaid Salah, Algeria’s army chief and de facto ruler, said that opponents of the elections are “a criminal gang full of bitterness and visceral hate for this country.” He also ordered security forces to stop any disturbances of the elections. On December 10, the Court of Sidi M’hamed in Algiers sentenced two former Algerian Prime Ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal, to 15 and 12 years in prison, respectively on corruption charges. However, the imprisonment of members from the former unpopular government and the promises of fairness in elections do not seem to have won over the Algerian protesters.

Rabat – Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit Morocco in January 2020, Maghreb Confidentiel reported on December 12. “Postponed several times this year, Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Morocco is finally scheduled for January, according to ministerial sources in Rabat,” the news outlet reported Prior to this latest report about Macron’s visit, Maghreb Confidentiel speculated that Maron would make an official trip to Rabat in April 2019. The news outlet reported that Macron would arrive in Morocco to inaugurate the new PSA Peugeot Citroen plant in Kenitra, a city north of Rabat, alongside King Mohammed VI. The King inaugurated the plant in June and Macron did not attend the inauguration ceremony. If Macron visits Morocco in January 2020, it will be his second visit to the kingdom after his first official trip in November 2018. The French President came to Morocco to inaugurate Morocco’s High-Speed Train or the TGV with King Mohammed. Morocco and France maintain regular cooperation with the exchange of visits from representatives from Rabat and Paris. The news about the potential visit of Macron came just a few weeks after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian’s visit to Rabat. During the visit, Le Drian met with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. The visit touched on several aspects, including means to strengthen cooperation and diplomatic relations between Rabat and Paris.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for the Integration of Immigrants has organized the first conference on Islamophobia in Spain. The conference started on Wednesday, December 11, at the University of Malaga, southern Spain, and will last over two days. More than 50 speakers are taking part in the event. They will discuss and analyze Islamophobic discourse in order to ensure better protection for Spain’s Muslim community, according to Spanish media. The Moroccan NGO organizing the event is based in Malaga and is fully funded by regional and central public organizations. The rise of the far-right Vox party in the latest elections is also a source of concern for the Muslim community in Spain. On Sunday, November 10, Vox won 52 seats in the Spanish Congress of Deputies after gaining only 24 in the April parliamentary elections. The party’s newfound popularity gave them the third most parliamentary seats in Spain. In July 2019, the Moroccan association of Malaga launched a telephone application to combat Islamophobia and hate crimes against Muslims. The NGO considers the application as part of the National Program for the Prevention of Islamophobia. The program seeks to protect the Muslim community in Spain against the rising scourge of Islamophobia. It also aims to “give specialized attention to cases of discrimination based on Islamophobia, improving the victims’ knowledge of their rights and existing resources,” as well as to increase the level of awareness and ability “to detect discriminatory incidents caused by Islamophobia.” The application is available on Google Play for free. Anadolu Agency reported in March that religious discrimination and hate crimes in Spain have increased, quoting a report from the Spanish Ministry of Interior. Miguel Angel Aguilar, a coordinator for services dealing with hate and discrimination crimes in Barcelona, told the press that his country is observing an increase of hate crimes “even though not at an alarming level, in Islamophobia and attacks against Muslims, and in religious hate in conversations on social media.” The report stated that there was a 120 % increase in hate crimes in 2017. Aguilar, according to Anadolu Agency, said that 39 out of 41 cases “related to religious hate crimes in 2017 were about Islamophobia.” The most religious hate crimes occur in the autonomous region of Catalonia. The region is home to 2 million Muslims.

Rabat – On Wednesday, December 11, in Casablanca, Greenpeace released a documentary concerning the endangerment of Moroccan Oases.  Since one of the responsibilities of Greenpeace campaigns is to shed light on the impact of climate change in the MENA region, the organization released a short documentary on the challenges that women living in oases face due to the consequences of climate change. The documentary is accompanied by a petition entitled “Protect Moroccan oases,” calling for the protection of these endangered areas by acting quickly, providing a voice, and demanding a transition to renewable energies. The oases are absolutely necessary for life in the desert and are characterized by their biological diversity, inhabitants, and culture, says Greenpeace.  However, they are endangered because of the considerable impact that high temperatures have on water resources. As a result, agricultural and livestock activities have declined, causing the displacement of indigenous populations.    According to a report conducted by Dr. Mohamed Madani named “The impact of climate change on Arab countries,” the frequency of droughts has increased in the last 20 to 40 years in Tunisia, Morocco, Syria, and Algeria. The annual frequency in Morocco has increased from once every five years to once every two years. With fossil fuels being the main source of electricity generation, the Earth, and therefore the oases, have increased in temperature, says Greenpeace. “We are witnessing fundamental changes in their ecosystems,” said Julien Jreissati, campaign manager for Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa.  He continued: “What the Moroccan oases are undergoing exemplifies the impact of climate change around the world; the complete disappearance of civilizations, their peoples, and the loss of natural environment.” The Morrocan Minister of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries and the director of Rural Development of Water and Forests, Aziz Akkhanouch said in a statement: “Nearly two-thirds of oasis habitats in Morocco have disappeared in the last century. This process has accelerated in recent decades due to the considerable increase in temperatures.” Communities living in the drylands and oases of developing countries are among the most threatened by the impacts of climate change. Greenpeace emphasizes that the disappearance of oases affects Morocco and all of the other countries in North Africa that are encompassed by dry deserts such as Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria During its campaign, Greenpeace addressed a petition to the leaders of the Moroccan government, reminding them that they play a pivotal role in acting on global climate negotiations and forums. Greenpeace concludes that they must “strengthen their commitments to fight the effects of climate change for the defense of Moroccan culture, wealth, and heritage.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI dedicated a lengthy section of his speech at the symposium held in Rabat on Thursday, December 12 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to renew Morocco’s firm position on the Palestinian cause. Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita read King Mohammed VI’s message to the attendees of the symposium.   The first lines of the King’s letter underlined the importance of the OIC and its objectives to defend the interests of Muslims across the globe, and to help to find a solution to end disputes and conflicts. King Mohammed VI then spoke about the unity and the “unwavering faith” of the members of OIC in the legitimacy of their primary cause: Palestine and Jerusalem question. The monarch renewed the “constant commitment” of Morocco, its King, and government as well as the people to defend Al Quds and Palestine and “to preserve the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, by all political, diplomatic legal means and by all possible forms of mobilization on the ground.” Morocco’s government has long supported the Palestinian cause, with full determination to continue to defend its internet and the legitimate rights of Palestinians. The message of the King echo’s his recent statement to the Annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People celebrated on November 29. In his previous message, the King spoke about the exclusivity of the two-state solution as the means to end the Israeli-Palestine conflict. He also emphasized Morocco’s unchanged position of solidarity and an independent Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. In today’s message, the monarch reaffirmed the need to find a solution to the Palestinian cause, saying that this desire stems from “our firm belief that peace in the Middle East necessarily entails the establishment of an independent Palestinian state defined according to the borders of 1967 and whose capital is the eastern part of Al Quds.” “We urge the international community to be responsible for the development of a new road map to implement the resolutions of international legality and the peace agreements concluded so far,” the King added. He stipulated that the international community’s ultimate goal is “to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.” The King also acknowledged division and “horrible sectarianism” among the OIC Member states. He added that the celebration of the 50th anniversary of OIC is occurring in a “complex and intricate international environment” due to crises in some OIC member countries. “They have had serious repercussions at regional level, not only exacerbating the risk of division and horrible sectarianism but also fueling extremism and terrorism,” the monarch said in the message. He asked the member states to take a moment to identify the consequences and the “root causes that have led to this situation.” “We should stand up to the parties that are seeking to exploit the crisis in order to foment division or redraw the map of the Islamic world using, to that end, criteria that ignore identity as much as historical facts. These parties have been trying to interfere with the destiny of nations and are putting global security and stability in jeopardy,” he concluded.

Rabat – Morocco is a leading country in the fight against terrorism, the chief Prosecutor of Spain’s National Audience, Jesus Alonso, said on December 11 in Marrakech. Alonso commented on Morocco’s counterterrorism leadership during a plenary meeting of the members of the Quadripartite Group against Terrorism. “Like Spain, France and Belgium, Morocco is determined to eradicate this cross-border global phenomenon, which threatens the security and stability of the international community,” he said. The Spanish official also called for a shared responsibility to curb organized crime, emphasizing that terrorism is one of its forms. “The situation is different from one country to another. Each one has its specificities, its own culture and religion but the threat is always the same.” The prosecutor emphasized that Spain and its allies have been sharing information. The situation, however, requires more effort. “We should work more on the homogenization of legal and judicial systems,” he said. He added that even if each state has its priorities, countries share the same goal: bringing peace, security, and prosperity. “This represents the challenge and the major challenge for the four fellow countries that have really managed to minimize the impact of terrorism,” he said. Alonso acknowledged that terrorism is not a new situation in Spain, which has suffered from the phenomena for years. “Our membership in this Quadripartite Group will allow us to share experiences and expertise and to use new communication technologies to more coordination,” he added. Morocco maintains a leadership role in the counterterrorism field, garnering international recognition from its allies. On an annual basis, the US State Department spotlights Morocco’s counterterrorism efforts on its Country Report on Terrorism. The recent report said that Morocco has ‘comprehensive” strategies to curb terrorism. Morocco also works to combat the roots of violent extremism through education, promoting moderate religious teachings, conducting youth outreach, modernizing systems of prison management, and implementing terrorist rehabilitation programs.

Rabat – The World Bank pledged to lend Morocco $275 million for a Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan. Yesterday, December 11, the World Bank officially approved the funding designed to support Morocco is developing its response to the impact of natural disasters and climate-related shocks. The loan also aims to help Morocco to develop a  Deferred Drawdown Option for Catastrophe Risks (Cat DDO) to manage the financial impact of natural disasters.  “The Cat DDO will support reforms designed to strengthen the financial, governance, and operational framework of the Solidarity Fund against Catastrophic Events,” according to a statement from the World Bank.  The World Bank’s Maghreb country director Jesko Hentschel outlined the project’s aim in a press release. “The Cat DDO aims to help Morocco develop a comprehensive framework for disaster risk management, building on a previous World Bank-supported program, the Integrated Disaster Risk Management and Resilience Program for Results.”  “Developing a comprehensive risk insurance is particularly critical for the vulnerable population whose livelihood can be threatened in the event of a natural disaster,” Hentschel explained. The fund is “a critical tool which complements private insurance by providing compensation to the uninsured, such as the poor and most vulnerable.” In order to insulate the country against the financial shock of natural disasters, the Cat DDO “makes use of sophisticated risk financing instruments to cover losses caused by extreme flooding and earthquakes,” the World Bank statement explains.  In practical terms, the program means that in the face of natural disasters such as flooding or earthquakes, Morocco’s government will have direct access to liquid funds to support rescue operations as well as emergency response.  Augustin Maria, Senior Urban Development Specialist and co-Task team leader explained that “The program will help the government’s understanding of the financial risks associated with natural disaster and also improve its knowledge of how to prevent these risks through better investment planning and more investment in risk reduction, preparedness, and financial protection.”  The program will also upgrade Morocco’s National Civil Protection system and launch a National Flood Risk Management Information System. The approval of the loan comes after several months of trials for the Moroccan government, with four earthquakes hitting central Morocco in the space of two weeks after widespread flooding killed at least seven people.  An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 degrees on the Richter scale hit the province of Midelt, Central Morocco on Sunday, November 17. The first quake was quickly followed by three more earthquakes, with the most recent hitting Morocco on December 5.  Flooding ravaged the Moroccan countryside in late August and early September with heavy rainstorms hitting the province of Taroudant. The flood killed seven people including a 17-year-old when a river burst its banks, sweeping over a recently built football facility. The flooding spread as far as Tata, 180km southeast of Taroudant, where local authorities evacuated 200 people from their homes in response to the floods.

Rabat – Morocco is set to celebrate today, December 12, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) with a ceremony under the theme: “Morocco: Modernization and Action.” The ceremony will take place at the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan expatriates, said a statement from the ministry. The OIC is an international organization made up of 57 member states and serves as a “collective voice for the Muslim world,” according to the organization’s website. The aim of the group is to “safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony” on a global scale.  The celebration is an opportunity to examine Islamic common action over the past year and plan upcoming initiatives and projects. A key part of the organization’s work is promoting solidarity with the plight of the Palestinian people, an issue too close to the heart of the Moroccan state.  Morocco, a steadfast ally to the Palestinian people, renewed its commitment to the “just Palestinian cause” in November this year and condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank. “We stand with our Palestinian brothers in their distress and support all their rights, especially the right to establish an independent and viable state of Palestine,” said Moroccan ambassador to Cairo, Ahmed Tazi.  As chairman of the Al Quds Committee, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, has taken on a pioneering role within the organization and led the charge in diplomatic action to defend the rights of the Palestinian people and well as action on the ground in Palestine, bringing aid through urbanization, education, health, employment and preservation of the urban and historic heritage of the holy city. Morocco has always held a key role in the OIC and hosted the first unofficial meeting of the organization in Rabat, September 1969. The meeting led to the founding of the organization, now the second-largest intergovernmental organization after the United Nations.  The OIC’s key priorities in the OIC-2025 blueprint laid out in the 2015 Ten-Year-Action plan, include: “issues of Peace and Security, Palestine and Al-Quds, Poverty Alleviation, Counter-terrorism, Investment and Finance, Food Security, Science and Technology, Climate Change and Sustainability, Moderation, Culture and Interfaith Harmony, Empowerment of Women, Joint Islamic Humanitarian Action, Human Rights and Good Governance.” Ministers and representatives of the troika of the Islamic Summit (Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Gambia), the ministerial troika (Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates and Niger), the OIC Secretary-General, as well as a number of diplomats representing international Islamic governments.

Rabat – Despite Morocco’s recently-announced animal welfare reforms, local authorities allegedly authorized the slaughter of dozens of dogs on Tuesday, December 10 in Dar Bouazza, a coastal town near Casablanca. “It was chaos,” one witness said to Morocco World News, choosing to remain anonymous.  Another resident of the neighborhood woke up to the sound of gunshots at 6:30 am on Tuesday and immediately went looking for the dogs. The resident faced off with the armed men and called for help, and a crowd soon gathered.  “When they saw the crowd they moved,” the witness said. “We followed them, trying to save the dogs we feed.” The source went on to describe an act of what can only be described as bravery.  “The only way [to stop the killing] was to be among the dogs so they can’t shoot. The guys still pointed the guns to threaten us to move.” When the group refused to back down, the two teams of authorized gunmen retreated. But this is not the end, the witness warned.  “As soon as we stop them, they [will] disappear and go to another neighborhood.” The witness reported that the authorized gunmen killed between 50 and 80 dogs, “but it [could] be more.” The dogs had been neutered and vaccinated by the community, according to the witness, but the tags on their ears did not save them from the bullets.  “We really love those dogs, and more and more people are changing their views toward strays,” the witness said. “We do our best and it’s still not enough.” MWN contacted Dar Bouazza officials for comment but got no response. Warning: Graphic content Anonymous witnesses provided MWN with videos and pictures.       Empty promises It has been only three weeks since Morocco’s Ministry of Interior signed an agreement with the agriculture and health sectors, along with the National Veterinarians Authority, to decrease Morocco’s stray dog population through sterilization. Local and international animal welfare groups have long been calling for a large-scale TNR program (trap, neuter, return) to ethically reduce the stray dog population. The November 21 announcement sparked celebrations throughout the kingdom and abroad amongst animal welfare activists. To some residents of Dar Bouazza, the animal welfare reforms are nothing but empty promises.  “The problem of stray dogs deserves a solution, certainly, but a functional solution,” another resident said to MWN. “Slaughtering the dogs only has the effect that other dogs will take their place.”

 Rabat – The Organization of Teachers Holding Higher Education Diplomas announced plans to prolong their strike for a second week. The teachers began striking on Monday, December 2. The strike is coupled with protests in front of the Moroccan Parliament in Rabat. The latest public demonstration took place on Monday, December 9, and resulted in clashes between protesters and the police. The organization justified the lengthening of the strike with the “unresponsiveness of the Ministry of Education and the oppression that protesters suffer from.” The teachers want an end to the ministry’s new promotion policy, launched in 2015. The new policy introduced written and oral tests for teachers who seek a promotion. The previous policy ensured promotion for teachers who obtain a higher education diploma upon completion of an interview. On December 9, the organization started their demonstration in front of the Ministry of Education’s headquarters. At the start of the protests, the teachers carried a fake birthday cake symbolizing the fourth anniversary of the protests that started in 2015. “It is unbelievable that teachers holding higher education diplomas complete the same duties as their colleagues, but do not have the right of [automatic] promotion,” said Abdelouahab Shimi, a member of the coordination. كلمة حول مسطرة ترك الوظيفة Posted by ‎عبد الوهاب السحيمي‎ on Monday, 9 December 2019 After several hours of protests in front of the ministry’s headquarters, protesters started moving towards the parliament. During the march, protesters clashed with the police, resulting in five injuries among the teachers. After the clashes, protesters started repeating: “Fewer police, more schools.” In front of the parliament, the protesters removed their shoes and socks and started walking barefoot to express the “poor situation of teachers” in Morocco. The protests continue despite the Ministry of Education making promises back in February 2019 to find answer the teachers’ demands. Following the protests, the National Organization for Contractual Teachers, who also carry out regular strikes, released a statement expressing their solidarity with their colleagues. Posted by ‎التنسيقية الوطنية للأساتذة الذين فرض عليهم التعاقد‎ on Saturday, 7 December 2019 The ongoing demonstrations and strikes illustrate the difficult situation that the Ministry of Education faces. On December 3-4, contractual teachers went on a nationwide strike, calling for the same rights as teachers on permanent contracts. The strike came a few weeks after the organization’s meeting with Minister of Education Said Amzazi to find a resolution. It remains to be seen if the Ministry of Education will be able to defuse the situation and convince the protesting teachers to go back to their classes.

Rabat – Jamaica has reiterated its decision to withdraw its recognition of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica Kamina Johnson Smith announced at a press briefing in Rabat on December 11 that her country firmly supports the UN-led political process and its efforts to find a durable solution to the  Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – The European Court of Auditors published on December 11 the findings of a recent assessment of the impact of EU funding on Morocco’s reforms. The Court’s report showed limited results in supporting the country’s reforms, especially in its key sectors The Court criticized the European Commission for the funding allocation, saying that the grants were spread across “too many areas, which may have weakened its impact.” The report explained that the management of the development programs was“hampered by weaknesses in the way they were designed, implemented and monitored.” The report also recalled that the EU is Morocco’s biggest “donor of development aid.” According to the document, the commission planned projects estimated at  €1.4 billion of aid, designed to impact three priority fields: Social services, rule of law, and sustainable growth.  “By the end of 2018, it had concluded contracts for €562 million and made payments of almost €206 million under its budget support instrument, which is aimed at promoting reforms and sustainable development goals and makes up 75 % of EU annual spending for the country,” the Court said. The auditors evaluated whether the funding support from 2014 to 2108 was effective in impacting the development of the three sectors. “EU budget support for Morocco did not provide sufficient support for the country’s reforms and progress on key challenges was limited,” said Hannu Takkula, the ECA Member responsible for the report. The report also called on the EU Commission to focus on fewer sectors, as well as to strengthen the “political and policy dialogue with Morocco.” The auditors specified that the sectors defined by the Commission consisted of 13 sub-sectors, “many of which could be considered as stand-alone sectors.” The Court, therefore, warned that “such a broad definition of eligible areas covering a large number of sectors reduces the potential impact of EU support.” The EU is one Morocco’s key partners, with cooperation in different fields, including education and migratory issues. The EU has given Morocco significant financial assistance to tackle migratory issues due to the increase of irregular migration.

Rabat – A 40-year-old woman has attacked a Muslim teenager in Sheffield UK for wearing a hijab. The incident was caught on camera and the video was later posted on Twitter. In the footage, a group of students at least four of whom are veiled, argue with the woman on a parked bus before the woman attacked two of the girls. A Muslim schoolgirl was beaten up and racially abused by a woman in Sheffield, UK. The woman was later arrested by police. pic.twitter.com/ZToFWrGCx7 — CJ Werleman (@cjwerleman) December 7, 2019  The woman was accompanied by a 44-year-old male who allegedly started the incident by shouting racial slurs at one of the girls. A boy on the bus tried to defend the girl, but the woman shoved and punched him. One of the victims of the attack, Redena Al Hadi, 14, attempted to stop the woman by telling her that the boy she hit is a minor, only aggravating the woman more. “I then tried to get all of the girls off the bus, but the woman came up to my face and started saying my hijab was making her sick. I felt really hurt. She pulled my head down and dragged me off the bus,” Al Hadi said in an interview with the Mirror. Al Hadi’s 13-year-old sister, Wida, was also attacked, but Al Hadi became the focus of the woman’s aggression. The woman dragged Al Hadi off the bus by her hijab and repeatedly slapped and punched her while holding her to the ground. The man, as seen in the video, kept people away from the attack. The sisters were both left with bruising and emotional trauma. Wida is not only afraid of going to school, but of leaving the house entirely. “When she was strangling me, I thought I was going to die,” Al Hadi told Metro. Earlier that day, police investigated Nursery Tavern in Sheffield for a complaint concerning racial abuse by the same couple. Police arrested the couple following the attack, but later released the woman with a caution as it was a “first offense.” The man remains in custody, waiting for possible court proceedings. The sisters and their representative, Arshaid Bashir, were extremely upset with the Sheffield Police’s decision. According to Bashir, it was an “assault on a child where derogatory language had been used. It was a racially aggravated assault. There was serious harm to a child who was attacked due to her appearance.” With only a warning, Al Hadi worries that the woman “could do this to another Muslim” and that “she shouldn’t be on the streets.” Al Hadi concludes, “I am now too scared to leave my house.”

Rabat – Lesotho’s Foreign Minister, Lesego Makgothi, has announced that his country maintains a “neutral” position on the Western Sahara conflict.  Following a meeting in Rabat with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita on December 10, the minister emphasized that Lesotho has officially withdrawn any previous statements of support for the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).   Makgothi reiterated that Lesotho fully backs the UN-led  political process in Western Sahara. The minister added that the country backs Morocco’s efforts to  find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.  He added that Lesotho’s previous statements on the conflict are “void and have no value.” The country is committed to retaining its position of neutrality at all regional, continental, and international meetings and forums.  Makgothi’s statement to the press on Tuesday came a few months after the African country issued a communique on October 4, 2019 suspending all decisions relating to the self-declared SADR.  Makoghi echoed his country’s position during Tuesday’s press briefing. “I am here today to confirm and clarify my country’s position,” he announced. The official  explained that he wanted to remove any perceptions of ambiguity about Lesotho’s official line on the conflict.  “The Kingdom of Lesotho expresses its sincere wish that its neutral position on the Sahara issue will give a strong signal to all parties that the kingdom of Lesotho stands alongside the International Community in their efforts to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to this regional conflict,” the Lesothan foreign minister underlined on Tuesday. Bourita commented on Lesotho’s decision, expressing his satisfaction with the relations between the two countries. Makgothi’s visit to Rabat “opens a new page in our bilateral relations,” Bourita underlined. During their meeting in Rabat, the two foreign ministers sat down to discuss south-south cooperation and the potential strengthening of bilateral ties between Lesotho and Morocco, as part of Morocco’s Africa-facing diplomatic gaze.  This is an “important” or even “historic” visit for bilateral relations between Rabat and Maseru, said Bourita, welcoming this first visit by a foreign minister of Lesotho. The visit, Bourita believes, provides the necessary clarifications in relation to Lesotho’s position on the question of the Moroccan Sahara. Lesotho’s decision comes as “more than half of SADC is adopting a constructive position on the question of the Moroccan Sahara,” according to Bourita. Both Malawi in 2017 and Lesotho in 2019, as well as several other SADC countries, have been clear in their support for Morocco’s willingness to fully engage in the UN-led  political process in Western Sahara. The decision will come as another disappointment to the self-proclaimed SADR, who lost several supporters this year, including El Salvador and Barbados.

Rabat – As part of Morocco’s efforts to highlight and raise awareness for gender-related issues, Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) conducted a six-month survey to study the circumstances and consequences of violence against women and girls. The study is in line with Morocco’s campaign against the scourge of violence against women, launched on November 29. The survey found that out of 13.4 million women aged between 15 and 74, more than 7.6 million have experienced at least one act of violence in the previous 12 months. The alarming figure represents 57 % of the female population. In urban areas, women experience more violence than in rural areas, however the difference is slight. The HCP reports that 58 % of women, representing 5.1 million women experience violence in Moroccan cities, while  55% of women experience violence in rural areas, or 2.5 million women. Despite the high numbers represented in the survey, the HCP claims that violence against women did start to decline  between 2009 and 2019. The survey argues that the proportion of women who have experienced at least one act of violence has decreased by 6 %, from 63% to 57 %  “if we consider only the 2009 target population of women aged 118 to 64 years,” the HCP reported. According to the HCP, sexual and economic violence has increased alarmingly compared to psychological and physical violence. The HCP survey finds that the prevalence of psychological and physical violence dropped by almost 9 points. The statistics show that the physical and psychological violence dropped from 58% to 49%. Sexual and economic violence, however, saw a notable increase of 7 points. Economic violence increased from 8% to 15% while sexual violence increased by 5 points, from 9%  to 14%. The alarming statistics come at a time when Morocco is increasingly advocating about women’s empowerment, especially after the introduction of law 103.13 to reduce the scourge of violence on women. Morocco passed the law in 2018 , criminalizing cyber crimes and sexual harassment in public. Women’s rights activists have long complained about the law’s vagueness and brevity, as well as the impossibility of enforcing it. Domestic violence on the rise Domestic violence remains prevalent, the report finds. The report shows that 6.1 million women experienced domestic violence, an increase of 1 point compared to 2009. The figure represents 52% of women. The report says that domestic violence mostly affects the least educated, youth, and the most affected by unemployment. HCP’s 2019 statistics show that 5.3 million women, aged 15 to 74,  are victims of violence perpetrated by a husband or ex-husband, a fiancé, or an intimate partner. The report shows that  52% of married women experienced domestic violence. Looking at young women aged 15 to 24, 59% have been victims of  domestic violence victims, meanwhile 54% of women with a medium level of education have experienced violence.Fifty-six percent of unemployed women have experienced domestic violence. The HCP conducted the survey between February and July 2019. The study covered the all regions across Morocco, with a sample of 12,000 girls and women and 3,000 boys and men aged 15 to 74 years. Violence in schools The HCP also noted high number of women experiencing psychological violence in education and training institutions. According to the study, 22% of students reported having experienced violence. “The perpetrators of this violence are in 46% of the cases are peers of the victims, 28% are the teachers,” while 21%  are foreign to the establishment.  With regards to the categories of violence at education and training institutions, the acts of violence are 52% psychological, 37% sexual harassment, and 11% physical.

Paragraph 83 of the final  joint communique said that the Supreme Council “ directed that the existing strategic partnerships are to be strengthened with the brotherly countries, including Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, Iraq, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.” The statement comes as no surprise as members of the GCC, especially Saudi Arabia and UAE, recently reiterated their determination to continue to support Morocco’s key interests, including its territorial integrity. The vows come after alleged friction between Morocco and its two allies. The reported rift started in late 2018, when inSaudi Arabia lobbied against Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup.  Morocco and Saudi Arabia also experienced cold diplomatic moments in 2018 during Morocco’s bidding process to win the 2026 World Cup hosting rights. Turki Al Sheikh, one of the closet officials to the Saudi palace, who holds close relations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman made hostile comments about Morocco throughout the bid. Saudi Arabia subsequently voted for Morocco’s rival, the North American bid. Morocco’s diplomatic channels sensed Saudi’s hostile moves since 2018, with an anonymous source from the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledging it in June 2018. “It is just a matter of time. Rabat is taking its time to know the intentions and priorities of the new Saudi authorities. In the end, Morocco’s national interests will always prevail,” a source at the foreign affairs ministry said under conditions of anonymity. Observers believe that the tension surged in Late January this year, after an interview broadcast by Al Jazeera with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who renewed Morocco’s independent diplomacy on the Qatar blockade, the Yemen war, and other regional issues.  A month after the interview, Saudi broadcaster Al Arabiya aired a documentary questioning Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara. Reports suggested that Morocco had recalled both of its ambassadors from UAE and Saudi Arabia after the documentary.  The minister of foreign affairs, however, denied that the envoys were recalled. Instead, he argued that Morocco summoned both emissaries for “consultations on the profound chances that the Gulf region is experiencing at the level of relations between” Gulf countries and Morocco. Throughout 2019, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs denied any friction with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, stating that the relations between the two allies are historic and strategic. In March, the official acknowledged that the relations between the three countries, should be based on reciprocity. “It may happen that we do not agree on certain issues. Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” said Bourita.

Rabat – From December 2-8, 15 people died and 1,836 others sustained injuries, including 61 severe injuries, in 1,404 urban traffic accidents across Morocco. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a press release that the accidents were mainly due to lack of control of vehicles, not respecting priority, excessive speeding and pedestrian and driver errors. Police issued a total of 38,033 traffic tickets during the same week, resulting in a sum of MAD 5,612,050 in fines, added DGSN. Despite the launch of a new national strategy for road safety in 2017, aiming to reduce the number of road accidents victims, the numbers are still far from low. In 2018, around 3,485 people died from road accidents, including 893 pedestrians (26% of all victims), and 1,175 two-wheel and three-wheel drivers (34%). In the same year, around 128,249 people sustained injuries, including 8,725 with severe injuries. The number of road accidents in 2018 reached 96,133, including 3,066 fatal accidents. Over the last decade, 3,500 people lose their lives in road accidents every year, while 12,000 sustain severe injuries. This averages to about 10 deaths and 33 serious injuries per day. The previous national strategy for road safety (2004-2013) saved around 9,210 lives and spared thousands of severe injuries, according to the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics. The number of victims, however, is still high compared to developed countries, according to the same source. The new road safety strategy (2017-2026) aims to bring the number of deaths to less than 1,900 by 2026, with a median objective of not exceeding 3,000 road accident deaths in 2020. According to the World Health Organization, road accidents are a major global problem. Each year, around 1.3 million people die of road accidents and several millions get injured or handicapped because of them.

Rabat  – A US citizen has accused an employee of Morocco’s carrier  Royal Air Maroc (RAM) of harassment after he used her WhatsApp number without her permission. The woman called Maria Gladstone shared a screenshot of the RAM employee’s message on WhatsApp with a complaint to the national carrier. She explained that she was at  Casablanca International Airport on December 2. The US tourist presumed that the RAM employee had taken her number from the company’s system to text her. “Does he have my address too? I feel very unsafe about this,” she added. Despite the removal of the original post from her Facebook, the screenshot of the employee’s message to the tourist had already gone viral on Facebook and other social networks.  Some Facebook users shared the post, calling the employee “RAM’s Romeo”. The original WhatsApp message reads: “Hello Maria, i (sic) don’t know if you remember when you were in casablanca airport, i (sic) did the check in and I asked about your number, actually i did that [because] in [the] airport they don’t allow s (sic) to take personal informations (sic) from passengers.” “i’m (sic) sorry if i got your number without your permission,” he added. The American woman, whose  Facebook info says she is from New York, denied having given her number to the RAM employee. “Edit: to be clear, I never gave my phone number out to anyone. The only way he would have found it is from the airport,” she said.

Rabat – Moroccan poet and politician Salah El Wadie has  responded to a recent controversial statement made by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch. Akhannouch stirred a backlash after he said that some Moroccans should be “disciplined” to respect the state and its institutions. The statement generated anger and a range of reactions from citizens and public figures, including the poet. On December 10, El Wadie published a post titled “Who really needs discipline is the one who stained 17 billions without even blinking an eye” to criticize Akhannouch. The poet then started to explain the difference between the word “education” and “discipline.” “There is certainly a huge difference between the concept of education and discipline.” He argued that education is a “peaceful word that expresses a positive action.” The poet added that  the word discipline is “provocative, frightening, threatening and violent.” The poet believes that such language should never have been used at a time when the state is working to ensure democracy and equality. “When a politician utters such a word [discipline], no matter how elegant he is, the word takes us back like a storm to another era, and to another rule,” he said. The poet made a reference to the era of the late monarch Hassan II. The poet was a political prisoner during the “years of lead,” a period described as the “worst years in the history of post-independence Morocco” in the 70s and 80s. The poet concluded his post, saying that people in Morocco deserve another “dictionary of speech” and respect. “We deserve to be Moroccans without anyone’s permission,” he added.

Rabat – The United Nations has categorically denied, on Tuesday, the “rumors” about the appointment by the UN Secretary-General of a new Personal Envoy for the Sahara, saying that these allegations are false and baseless. ” I wanted to say that there were some rumors that the Secretary General has made a decision on the appointment of his next Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. This is not true and baseless,” said Farhan Haq, Deputy spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General. “The process to select the Personal Envoy for Western Sahara is ongoing.  The Secretary General looks forward to appointing an Envoy as soon as the process is completed.,” said the Deputy spokesperson during his daily briefing in New York. The statement came after a number of news outlets close to the Polisario Front claimed that the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterrez, had appointed former Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Isabel Bishop, as his new Personal Envoy for Western Sahara. The position of UN personal envoy to the Western Sahara has been vacant since the latter part of last May when now former UN envoy Horst Kohler announced his resignation for “health reasons.”

Rabat – It is by now a very familiar scene in the Western Sahara conflict: Morocco accuses Algeria of being the main reason for the existence and continued hostility in the Western Sahara territorial dispute, while Algeria laughs off Morocco’s “unfounded claims,” saying that it is only an interested “observer” in a territorial conflict that fundamentally opposes Morocco and the Polisario Front. However, as Algeria tried, on two separate occasions in the past weeks, to come to the rescue of the Polisario Front amid converging reports of growing instability in the Polisario-run camps, the country appeared to unwittingly vindicate one of Morocco’s sticking points: That the Polisario Front is the offshoot of the Algerian military establishment. It also validates the argument  that there would be no Western Sahara territorial conflict had it not been for Algeria’s support for, and mentoring of, the independence-seeking breakaway group. The latest of the two developments came as Sabri Boukadoum, the foreign minister of the Algerian interim government, recently tried to paint Morocco’s intransigence as the main reason behind continued hostility between the two neighbors. Boukadoum, speaking to the Arabic version of the Russian outlet Sputnik suggested, in glaring disregard for some of the latest regional developments, that Algiers is—and has always been—in a mindset of dialogue and compromise with its Moroccan neighbor to “examine” their regional divergences, including on the Western Sahara question. He stressed his country’s belief in, and devotion to, “the relationship that binds Moroccans and Algerians.” For him, Algeria has always expressed its readiness for dialogue and compromise, only for Morocco’s inclination for expansionism and regional hegemony to block Algeria’s initiatives for friendly bilateral ties and regional stability. The latest news, mostly including Algiers’ long silence after King Mohammed VI’s repeated offers for “frank” and “brotherly” dialogue, does not corroborate the Algerian FM’s logic. He continued to make his case, however, saying his country is now setting out to “examine problems with Morocco, including the Western Sahara issue.” And what would happen after Algeria has examined the problem? Would that, for example, lead to the much-anticipated but consistently frustrated settlement hopes for Western Sahara? Boukadoum did not directly address such questions. He stressed, though, for the sake of anyone who might be doubtful of his country’s genuine interest in “political solutions,” that Algiers and Rabat owe it to their shared histories and similar social traits to collaborate and put an end to decades of hostilities and proxy war. As the Algerian FM shrewdly shunned suggestions of Algeria’s full involvement in the Western Sahara dispute, his assuredness when speaking of Algeria’s willingness to “examine” the standoff with Morocco on the Sahara question was understandably meant to showcase Algeria’s unmistakable regional significance. At the same time, however, Boukadom also appeared to unwittingly buttress one point Morocco has repeatedly raised in discussions over lasting settlement for Western Sahara: That Algeria sets the tone for Polisario. But that was only the least remarkable of the two developments mentioned at the outset. The second development came amid talks of growing security risks and of impending terrorist acts in Tindouf, an Algerian province that is home to the Polisario-run refugee camps. As Islamist groups set their sight on Africa and cause havoc in the Sahel region, a number of reports from foreign intelligence services marked the entire Sahel as potentially dangerous for travelers—especially Western nationals. Spain, the first country to officially sound the alarm over a concerning situation it described as stemming from “real” and “imminent” terrorist threats “confirmed by foreign secret services working in the region,” warned its citizens against traveling to the Polisario-run camps. As should be expected, Polisario’s response to Spain’s “attempts to distort” the camps’ reputation not only dismissed the security warnings, but it accused Madrid of conniving with Rabat to organize a smear campaign against Polisario and its “Sahrawi cause.” Polisario suggested the warnings were nothing but Spain peddling Moroccan tropes to embarrass the Polisario leadership and undermine its fight for self-determination in the disputed territories. “Once again, the Spanish government unfortunately seeks to create ambiguity and confusion, and even paint a fabricated picture of fear and imminent danger in the Sahrawi refugee camps. It is the same government that had previously sought to compel humanitarian organizations to cease their activities in the camps and to reduce the humanitarian support provided to the refugees in consonance with the campaign led by Morocco and France,” Polisario’s response notably said. The idea behind the militant group’s swift response was that it was in total control of ongoings in the Tindouf camps and that any other idea to the contrary was inaccurate and politically motivated. Amid the noise that resulted from that first wave of reports and counter-reports, TSA, one of the most reliable Algerian news outlets—especially on matters related to the developments within spaces of power in Algiers— reported similar security warnings from Algeria. TSA indicated that Algeria had provided the UN peacekeeping Mission in Western Sahara with “information regarding preparations to kidnap foreign nationals in the refugee camps and in areas east of the [Morocco’s defense] wall.” The news did not only confirm Spain’s narrative over Polisario’s; it also made—unintentionally, of course—a mockery of Polisario’s claims that Morocco was behind the “fabricated” security warnings. From Polisario came deafening silence, not knowing what, or whether, to reply to statements attributed to Algiers. It would have been both out of place and counterintuitive to deny Algeria’s reported warnings. But lurking beneath Polisario’s silence was Morocco’s suggestion that Tindouf is actually under Algerian control, with the Polisario leadership a figurehead, an outlet for Algeria’s regional ambitions. Things, however, got even more colorful at that point, with Algeria now flying to the defense of its protege—the Polisario leadership—to deny reports by a news outlet (TSA) whose reliability is partly due to its known closeness to the Algerian regime, its connections in the high places of Algiers’s political and military establishments. Also, TSA had not quoted an unnamed senior official, the usual anonymity card government officials use when speaking to the press on sensitive matters. Anonymity comes with the promise of convenient deniability. TSA had directly quoted “the Algerian government,” citing an official statement to which it had been granted access.  This made the news more reliable, less vague and less doubtful than the usual “an anonymous government official said” type of reporting. Yet, Algiers roundly denied the reports, with Abdelaziz Benali-Cherif, the spokesperson for the Algerian government, describing them as “false and unfounded.” The reports, Benali-Cherif said, were intended to “harm Algeria, its people, and its institutions.” More important still, the Algerian official added what, from a Moroccan perspective, hit the jackpot. “Tindouf camps are on Algerian territory and so their security is entrusted to the [Algerian] national army.” While well-intended in its defense of Polisario’s denial of Spain’s warnings, Algiers made matters more complicated for a militant group earnestly claiming “full control” and sovereignty in the Tindouf camps, which it tellingly refers to as its capital city. Polisario’s response to Spain said it was in full command in Tindouf and knows whatever happens in the camps’ remotest corner. And yet there was Algeria, strenuously siding with Polisario’s denial of growing insecurity in Tindouf but somehow hurting the group’s sovereignty claims. To say that security in Tindouf is “entrusted to” the Algerian army makes Polisario look like what Morocco has long presented it to be: an offspring of the Algerian military-industrial complex. Morocco’s point has always been that Algiers does not only lobby diplomatically to advance the “Sahrawi cause.” Algeria, Morocco has maintained over the years, sets the ground for Polisario, informs the tone of its self-determination-suffused rhetoric, fuels its “Sahrawi nationalism” narrative, and provides it with military logistics and personnel. Sandwiched between foreign warnings of instability in Tindouf and confirmations of such reports from its own backyard, Algeria could only come up with an ill-conceived denial that reinforced the very perception it set out to dispel: That Polisario operates at Algiers’s behest. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” Morocco’s King Mohammed VI emphasized in an April 2018 written note he addressed to the UN Secretary-General. While Algeria has often dismissed Morocco’s insistent claims that it bears “full responsibility” in the Western Sahara dispute, preferring to conveniently refer to itself as an “observer state,” the episode of narratives and counter-narratives around security in Tindouf is perhaps the closest thing to an inadvertent admission from Algeria that it does indeed have a lot to do with Polisario’s “Sahrawi cause” and virtually everything else that takes place in the Polisario-run territory. Meanwhile, amid the Morocco-Algeria proxy war in the region, there recently emerged glimpses of mounting exasperation among Polisario leaders at Algiers’s all-powerful grip on the front’s every move. In a recent interview, Bachir Mustapha Sayed, a senior Polisario member, appeared to be expressing displeasure at the fact that the militant group has no sovereignty over the camps it supposedly runs. Every move and consequential decision in relation with Tindouf, Sayed said, is actually dictated by Algiers. Nothing could be farther from being an “observer” state.

Rabat – Dutch foreign affairs minister Stef Blok  has said that diplomatic relations between his country and Morocco must improve. The official made his statement last week after the Moroccan ambassador to the Netherlands canceled a meeting with State Secretary Ankie Broekers-Knol. Blok, according to Dutch media, said that the decision to cancel a meeting “emphasizes the importance of improving the two countries’ relations.” Knol planned to meet with the Moroccan diplomat to speak about Moroccan Asylum Seekers whose requests had failed in the Netherlands.  She claimed that she had been unable to speak to Moroccan officials about the issue of failed Moroccan asylum seekers. Morocco, however, denied ever having received a request for talks. “Neither our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rabat, nor us [the Moroccan embassy] have been approached by the Dutch government for a request to talk about this,” a spokesperson of the Moroccan embassy to the Netherlands told the Dutch news outlet RTL Nieuws. Sigrid Kaag, minister of foreign trade and development cooperation said that “it is out of the question that the Dutch government would not be welcomed by Morocco.” Kaag described the situation as a miscommunication. Dutch broadcaster NOS quoted MP Madeleine van Toorenburg who condemned the Dutch official decision to shrink the meeting’s agenda to only migration issues. Dutch News said that Morocco’s embassy “expand the agenda” of the meeting to other issues, including trade. The Dutch minister, however, reportedly opposed the proposal. “How does she think things work in the diplomatic world. What powerlessness that she can’t make an appointment with the Moroccans,” MP Madeleine van Toorenburg told NOS. The MP described the official’s decision as clumsy. “That’s not the first time. How stupid can you be?” the MP added. She also described the situation as a “missed opportunity.” “We need something from Morocco,” van Toorenburg said.

Rabat – Following three years of preliminary investigations by French authorities, France opened a formal judicial inquiry into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup organization to Qatar and the suspected corruption behind it. France’s National Public Prosecutor’s Office opened the inquiry officially on Monday, December 9. The initial investigations aimed to determine whether a private dinner between officials from the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) and Qatari bid promoters influenced the selection process. The World Cup 2022 organization vote took place nine days after the dinner. Then French president Nicolas Sarkozy hosted the dining event at the Elysee Palace in Paris. The dinner included the Qatari crown prince Tamim bin Hamad al Thani who is undertaking the country’s preparations for the tournament. French authorities accused the Union of European Football Associations’ (UEFA) former president Michel Platini of switching his vote in favor of Qatar following the meal. Investigators suspected Platini of discussing potential lucrative trade deals between France and Qatar. French police arrested and interviewed Platini in June 2019. However, the Frenchman denied the claims and insisted that his vote was in favor of global football development. The inquiry will also concern FIFA’s former president Sepp Blatter. In 2015, Blatter was suspended from football for six years over an alleged payment of $2 million to Platini, only months after the award of the tournament to Qatar in December 2010. Qatar won the vote over the favored US with a score of 14 to 8 in the final round of voting. In 2011, only one month after the vote, Qatar announced testing French Dassault Rafale fighter jets to upgrade its military fleet. The Gulf country later bought 24 of the jets for $7 billion. After the opening of the inquiry by French authorities, FIFA also announced the reopening of its own investigation. FIFA has already published allegations bribery against three people on its 2022 World Cup website. In November 2019, FIFA posted that three former football officials; Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil, Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay, and Julio Grondona from Argentina, have allegedly received payments to vote for Qatar. The inquiry announcement comes as Qatar is in the final stages of preparation for hosting the 2022 World Cup. In September 2019, Qatar unveiled the tournament’s emblem in several world heritage sites around the world. The Kasbah of the Udayas in Rabat was among the places that showcased the emblem.

Rabat – Speaking on Monday, December 9, in Agadir, Lieutenant General and Commander of Morocco’s Southern Zone, El Farouk Belkhir said that the United Nations need to adapt their operations to the nature of modern conflicts “in the face of increasing threats.” At a seminar opening an international forum for discussions and review of United Nations peacekeeping operations, El Belkhir recalled that Morocco is proud to have been active in UN peacekeeping operations for over 60 years. However, he underlined, the traditional approach to operations must change. The Lieutenant General emphasized that the modern challenges facing Morocco and its allies in peacekeeping operations require a holistic, participative and inclusive approach.  Such an approach, he went on, can only be achieved through active dialogue and participation of all stakeholders at a regional and global level. Also attending the forum that will end on December 11, UN representative Major General Hugh Van Roosen said that resources and equipment are needed to facilitate the renewal of peacekeeping operations. He added that “improving soldiers’ operating conditions is a collective action” and a key requirement for capacity building at a logistical level. The opening session of the forum ended with an exhibition on Morocco’s contribution to humanitarian projects and peacekeeping operations over the last 60 years.  In a statement released after the December 4 visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the US State Department underlined Morocco’s efforts in international security, peacekeeping, and regional stability.  The State Department called Morocco one of the US’ key allies in ensuring regional stability, saying that the kingdom “takes a leadership role in African security.” The statement added that Morocco has more than 2,000 soldiers currently deployed in UN peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

Rabat – Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has caused a backlash from Moroccan citizens, who condemn his  recent “controversial” statements. Akhannouch along with several members of the office of the National Rally of Independents (RNI) travelled to Italy for a meeting with the Moroccan community in Milan on December 7. In front of an audience of dozens of people, the leader of the RNI said that Moroccans should “discipline” people who lack respect for the Morocca state and its institutions. “Justice is not the [only institution] that has to do its job, Moroccans should also do their job,” he said.  The minister, one of the 2019 Africa’s billionaires,  received applause from his supporters attending the meeting, encouraging him to continue with his controversial line of argument. He said, “there is no place for whoever insults Morocco and its institutions (…)“Whoever wants to live in Morocco must respect its motto;”  God, Nation, King. The statement comes after Moroccan YouTuber Mohammed Sekkaki, known as Moul Kaskita, filmed himself insulting Moroccan citizens and public institutions. Police arrested the YouTuber on November 30. Many Moroccans, however, took to social media to condemn Akhannouch’s statements publicly. Some Facebook users posted Akhannouch’s video, with a thumbnail reading, “We are going to repeat the boycott” in response to his statement. The 58-year-old billionaire is the majority owner of Akwa Group, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate company operating mainly in the oil and gas industry. Last year, massive number of Moroccans decided to launch a campaign against three major companies, mineral water Sidi Ali, dairy company Centrale Danone, and Akhannouch’s oil firm, Afriquia gaz.  The campaign sought to combat the high cost of living in Morocco. Akhannouch dismissed the campaign publicly, stating that the boycott would not affect sales of the companies, including that of Centrale Danone. “Moroccans drink milk morning and afternoon…this is not a game,” he said last year in April.  The boycott, however, urged Centrale Danone to increase its efforts to lower prices and meet the demands of citizens after deterioration of sales throughout the period of the campaign. Akhannouch also angered Moroccans in October when he jokingly told the governor of Midelt province, central Morocco that the prices of local apples are “too low.”  Akhannouch was visiting the National Apple Fair.  A video has gone viral, documenting Akhannouch calling for raising the  price of apples because of their good quality.After tasting an apple, Akhannouch said, “these apple prices are too low, it’s unbelievable! The prices should be higher.”

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasna, as the chairwoman of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection, is at the forefront of multiple environmental initiatives in the kingdom and abroad.  During a meeting with the board of directors of the foundation on December 9, Princess Lalla Hasna reviewed the environmental projects that the kingdom launched in 2019. The foundation manages almost 20 programs in the fields of environmental education, coastline, air and climate, sustainable tourism, the palm grove of Marrakech, and Morocco’s historic gardens.  Field visits Princess Lalla Hasna made two field visits in support of the foundation’s programs. She first traveled to the Al-Masjid Eco-Schools in Ain Aoudi, near Rabat. The Ain Aoudi site has worked to expand the eco-schools program to include a total of 2,172 schools in both rural and urban communities.  The Princess then visited the Palm Grove Safeguarding Program in Marrakech to gauge its agroecology program. The program benefits the farmers’ families and facilitates an important irrigation mechanism using the city’s wastewater.  Hassan II International Environmental Training Center In June 2019, Princess Lalla Hasna inaugurated the Hassan II International Environmental Training Center in Bouknadel, north of Rabat, and dedicated it to environmental awareness and education. The center is now at the heart of the foundation’s education, awareness, and outreach programs including Eco-Schools, Young Reporters for the Environment, Clean Beaches, and Air-Climate.  Clean Beaches: ‘bhar bla plastic’ Clean Beaches is an annual campaign that clears 100 beaches across Morocco of plastic and trash in order to fight plastic waste pollution in oceans.  The objective of the campaign is to sensitize beachgoers, and civilians in general, about the dangers that plastic presents for the ocean and its creatures. With its slogan ‘bhar bla plastic’ (better without plastic), the campaign aims to mobilize civilians to clean beaches. During its 20th campaign from July 3, 2019, to August 31, Clean Beaches helped clear two beaches near Casablanca of 1,700 kilograms of plastic.  Air-Climate The Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection launched the Air-Climate program in 2018 to empower Moroccans in mitigating local air pollution and global warming. The program also aims to educate citizens and businesses about the impacts of greenhouse gases and climate change.  The program has a strong foothold in Marrakech, Morocco’s pilot city for introducing electric motorcycles throughout the country.  African Youth Climate Hub In September 2019, the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection launched the African Youth Climate Hub in collaboration with the Children and Youth Constituency to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Morocco’s OCP Group, and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The African Youth Climate Hub is a virtual space for exchange and support among young Africans regarding issues of climate change. The hub aims to contribute meaningfully to climate action through youth-based and inclusive projects with a focus on measurable impacts across the continent and on a global scale.  African Youth Initiative on Climate Change In September 2019, the Moroccan royal presented the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. The project aims to empower African rural communities through a youth-led, collaborative initiative that encourages effective implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Environmental protection and preservation is a key priority of Morocco.  In early October 2019, King Mohammed VI warned participants at the 8th Islamic Conference of Environment Ministers that the current climate situation “has serious and alarming consequences for our planet today.” As the chairwoman of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection, Princess Lalla Hasna has long spearheaded the kingdom’s climate initiatives and she shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 135th out of 181 countries in the 2020 Global Climate Risk Index (CRI), with a score of 125. The report evaluates the extent of risk facing countries and regions affected by impacts of extreme weather, including storms, floods, and heatwaves. The analysis looked at recent data for 2018 as well as from 1999 to 2018 for comparison. NGO Germanwatch carried out the survey, ranking Morocco 115th in terms of “Fatalities” in 2018, and 115th in” fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants.” The report also ranked Morocco 104th in terms of losses in millions of US dollars and 135 in losses per unit gross domestic product (GDP) in percent. CRI measures extreme weather events in terms of fatalities and economic losses that occurred based on “data from the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE, which is considered worldwide as one of the most reliable and complete databases on this matter.” Last year, Morocco experienced floods in several regions. Severe floods hit several regions of Morocco in late September in Rhamna and Al Haouz, Sidi Ifni, Meknes, and Guelmim, causing up to five deaths. The floods also caused extensive property damage and agricultural casualties, from flooded houses to drowned livestock and blocked roads. This year, similar floods killed several people. On Sunday, September 8, a bus connecting Casablanca and Rissani, a town in Errachidia Province, fell off the Oued Damchan bridge. The accident was caused by floods. Additionally, flooding in the Taroudant region killed eight people after the river burst its banks onto a football pitch in August. Heavy rains also led to floods in the Khenifra province on September 2. The floods killed a teenage girl and an old man. The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2019 ranked Morocco 2nd out of all countries.  Morocco ranks first in Africa and the MENA region. The index takes into consideration “Greenhouse Gases” (GHG) emission, renewable energy, energy use, and climate policy. The ranking is mainly ascribed to Morocco’s different ecological initiatives and projects, including Morocco’s “Green Plan”, Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA) initiative, and the “Noor” project.

Rabat – The National Assembly of Quebec named two deputies of Moroccan origins, Marwah Rizqy and Moncef Derraji, as “Stars” of the year 2019. The National Assembly of Quebec is the legislative body of the province of Quebec in Canada. The assembly selected Rizqy as deputy of the year, while Derraji earned the title of “rising star” in the assembly. Both deputies represent the Quebec Liberal Party and have won their respective 2018 provincial elections. Quebec newspaper La Presse announced the decorations after conducting a survey among all members of the assembly. Rizqy had a remarkable year in the assembly. She risked backlash from her own party when she “suggested they apologize for their policy of austerity.” She also “suggested the creation of an office for ethics and conformity within the [liberal] party,” stated the newspaper. The publication also recalled Derraji’s distinctive stance in the debate about Quebec’s new program for immigration applicants. “He was able to work in a transpartisan way” on the issue so that immigrant students and workers are not penalized, adds the news outlet. Derraji was born in Marrakech and grew up in Morocco. After leaving for Quebec, he worked in pharmaceutics for more than 15 years. The Marrakech-native’s civic engagement earned him recognition in his neighborhood and among his colleagues. In 2009, Derraji founded the congress of Maghrebis in Quebec, an NGO aiming to integrate immigrants from the Maghreb into the professional and social life of Quebec. Derraji made his political debut in 2015 when he was elected as chairman of the Quebec Rally of Young Chambers of Commerce (RJCCQ). He has also conducted several economic missions in Morocco for the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM). While Derraji represents Montreal’s electoral district of Nelligan, his fellow Moroccan Rizqy, represents the district of Saint-Laurent in the same city. Rizqy was born and raised in Canada to Moroccan parents. Rizqy spent most of her life in Montreal, but she also lived in Florida, in the US, where she earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in fiscal law. Prior to her election, Rizqy worked as a tax law professor at the University of Sherbrooke. The former professor ran twice for office before her 2018 triumph. During her campaign, Rizqy presented herself as an “ardent fighter for employment and fiscal equity in Canada.” Rizqy is also the youngest deputy in the liberal party, at only 34 years old. As there are more than 300,000 Moroccans living in Canada, and in Quebec mostly, their representation in Canadian authoritative bodies continues to grow. In January 2019, Nizar Berdai, a 21-year-old Moroccan student was elected as a member of Quebec’s Youth Parliament, becoming one of the few members of the Arab-Muslim community with the youth parliament. Berdai moved to Canada in 2015, after getting his baccalaureate degree in Sale, Rabat’s twin city. He is a fourth-year finance student at HEC Montreal, and he is simultaneously completing a political science degree at McGill University.

 Rabat – A group of cancer patients and survivors in Morocco have launched a social media campaign under the hashtag “Mabghinach nmouto bsaratan” (We don’t want to die of cancer). The campaign seeks to improve healthcare for cancer patients in Moroccan hospitals and calls for free treatment. Patients, who call themselves “warriors,” shared pictures of themselves carrying the campaign’s slogan. They also posted videos narrating their struggles with Moroccan hospitals and complaining about the high cost of cancer treatment in Morocco. ما بغيناش نموتو بالسرطان مابغيناش نموتو بالسرطان بغينا نتعالجو بالمجان
لا حول ولا قوة الا بالله العلي العظيم Posted by ‎الرحمة مباشر‎ on Tuesday, 3 December 2019 Nihad, a 30-year-old cancer patient from Safi, shared her story in a 12-minute-long clip. According to her, negligence in hospitals is one of the main problems patients suffer from, as their situation is not taken seriously when cancer is in its early stages. The patient also protested overcrowding in hospitals and the expensive costs of cancer treatment. “In this country, if you fall sick and you don’t have money, just buy a coffin and sleep next to it awaiting death,” said Nihad in the footage, garnering the viewers’ empathy. A number of activists reacted to the campaign by sharing articles and videos about it, and by expressing their demands to the Ministry of Health. خوتي كلشي يبارطاجي حملة #حقنا_فالعلاج_المجاني Posted by CASA BEL VISA on Monday, 9 December 2019 The posts criticized the  Ministry of Health’s media campaigns. According to several patients, the campaigns are superficial and do not benefit the patients in any way. Posted by Rajaa Bouziane Nani on Sunday, 8 December 2019 The campaign started as a Facebook group for Moroccan cancer patients where they shared their pain and struggles and provided each other with emotional support. The group then moved onto WhatsApp, before deciding to go public with their suffering and share the campaign on public social media, according to Meryem Elhatimi, one of the “warriors” from Safi. Cancer in Morocco According to 2017 statistics, nearly 40,000 Moroccans are diagnosed with cancer each year. Breast cancer accounts for 36% of all cancer cases among female patients, making it the most common form of cancer among women, followed by cervical cancer (11.2%), thyroid cancer (8.6%), and colorectal cancer (5.9%). For men, lung cancer is the most common form, accounting for 22% of all cases, followed by prostate cancer (12.6%), and colorectal cancer (7.9%). Morocco has launched several projects to tackle cancer, such as creating regional centers for cancer treatment and increasing the number of medications available for cancer patients in Morocco. The plans, however, are still falling short of Moroccan cancer sufferers’. In 2018, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) issued a report on breast cancer patients in Morocco and an evaluation of Moroccan oncology centers. The report criticized Morocco’s breast cancer screening program. The program comes “up short in terms of the cancer detection rate even though the rate of annual screening coverage achieved was acceptable.” Although 60% of the yearly target population in Morocco undergo screening tests, detection rates for cancer measures far below average. Cancer detection in Morocco may be as low as 1 in 1,000 women. In comparison, screening tests in Europe find approximately 6 in 1,000 and report 5 in 1,000 in the US. The disparity leads the research center to believe many cases of breast cancer in Morocco go undetected. Another effort by the Ministry of Health to support cancer patients is reducing the prices of some medications. The ministry issues lists of drugs with reduced prices. While the price reductions do not target mainly cancer medication, they aim to make drugs more available to the public. The reductions are part of Morocco’s national drug policy, launched in 2013. The plan aims to reduce the prices of drugs used to treat chronic illnesses, including cancer. Since 2013, the Ministry of Health has been able to reduce the prices of more than 3,600 medications.

Rabat – The Court of Sidi M’hamed in Algiers has sentenced two former Algerian Prime ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal to 15 and 12 years in prison, respectively. The court announced its verdict on Tuesday, December 10. Algerian security services arrested both the officials in June on corruption-related charges.   The arrests of Sellal and Ouyahia are part of an anti-corruption drive following the fall of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April. The Sidi M’Hamed court fined Sellal of $8,000. The court also sentenced former minister of industry Abdessalem Bouchareb in absentia to 20 years in prison, Algerie Presse Service reported. Ouyahia will also pay a fine of $16,000. The court also sentenced Former Minister of Industry and Mines Youcef Yousfi to 10 years in prison. Former Minister of Public Works and Transport Abdelghani Zaalane, however, was acquitted. The former minister of industry received a sentence of 10 years in prison, while former governor of Boumerdes, Nouria Yamina Zerhouni, received a sentence of five years. The prosecutor near the court of Sidi M’Hamed requested on Sunday, December 8 a 20-year sentence for the two former prime ministers. The arrests of officials are led by de facto ruler Gaid Salah, who ordered the arrest of several other senior government officials for corruption-related charges. The decision to arrest senior officials comes amid continuous protests, which started in Algeria in February to demand a radical change of the “corrupt system.” In September, an Algerian military court sentenced Bouteflika’s brother, Said Bouteflika to 15 years in prison.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated a newly renovated sports center in Rabat’s twin city, Sale on Monday, December 9. The Mohammed VI Football Complex was renovated, costing a MAD 630 million.  The reopened complex seeks to provide national football professionals with an appropriate environment “conducive to success,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) completed the center on a 29.3-hectare plot that will be dedicated to the national teams during preparation camps for local and international competitions. The complex is within the framework of the national program for upgrading national football infrastructure, seeking to support the establishment of National Club Training Centers, including Raja of Casablanca (RCA) and Wydad Casablanca (WAC). The field will also host foreign national teams undertaking their training in Morocco.  Through the project, the FRMF wants to attract foreign national teams to contribute to the development of national tourism as well as to boost the country’s international influence. The new football center features advanced equipment in line with FIFA standards. In addition to sports facilities, the complex includes accommodation for the national team with 66 rooms and 4 suites. The project also houses three blocks with a capacity of 150 beds for the Under 23 national team and 45 rooms with a capacity of 80 beds for the Under 17 national team. The Mohammed VI National Complex has four natural grass football fields, three astro-turf football fields, and an indoor football field. It also includes a  hybrid football field, a re-training room that can host matches, an outdoor Olympic-sized pool, two tennis courts, and a beach soccer field. A new generation performance and sports medicine center is also part of the complex with rooms for physiotherapy, stress testing, dentistry, ophthalmology, trauma, psychology, podiatry, nutritional medicine, radiology, ultrasound, electrotherapy, osteodensitometry, cryotherapy, in addition to an emergency mobile medical unit.

Rabat – In collaboration with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Moroccan government has agreed to initiate an €82.6 million agricultural project to protect vulnerable rural farms in Morocco’s northeast Taza Province against the effects of climate change.  Agriculture represents 13% of Morocco’s GDP and employs 80% of people living in rural regions, says IFAD.  Morocco is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, leaving farmers at risk.  The Taza Mountain Integrated Rural Development Project (PRODER-Taza) is set to benefit 11,200 houses in rural regions by increasing their productivity and ability to adapt during climate change, IFAD says.  The project will be launched in the Tainast and Aknoul areas and aims to target vulnerable smallholder farms while focusing on women and young people. PRODER-Taza looks to integrate a “resilient orchard development model” sustainable during droughts and above average temperatures, says IFAD. Almost 24,200 acres of almond trees, 2,400 acres of fig trees, and 1,500 of olive trees will be planted.  PRODER-Taza will also protect nearly 81,540 acres of cultivated land against erosion.  In addition, the project will restore rural roads to create easier access to markets while reducing transportation costs. One hundred rural microenterprises will open job opportunities to women and young people as well, says IFAD.  Naoufel Telahigue, county director for Morocco, stated that PRODER-Taza is “aligned with Morocco’s priorities in poverty reduction, nutrition and food security and addressing the needs of women and youth.”  Signed on December 3, the financial agreement includes the Morrocan government contributing €43.6 million, IFAD giving a loan of €31.9 million and a €0.6 million grant, and beneficiaries contributing €6.5 million.  Based in Rome, IFAD is an international financial institution and a United Nations food and agricultural agency. IFAD’s aim is to invest in rural communities to “empower them” against poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition, and strengthen resilience.

Rabat – The UN Development Program’s 2019 Human Development Index has ranked Morocco as the 121st most developed country out of 189 countries. Although two places above its previous ranking, the new ranking puts Morocco two places below the state of Palestine, including the Gaza strip. With a score of 0.676, Morocco has “medium human development.” Elsewhere in the Maghreb, the UNDP considers Algeria (82nd globally) and Tunisia (91st globally) to have “high human development,” along with six other African countries that ranked above Morocco. The Seychelles, Mauritius, Botswana, South Africa, Gabon, and Egypt also fit into the high development ranking. The Human Development Index measures the ability “to live a long and healthy life, to acquire knowledge and to earn income for a basic standard of living.” Morocco has seen a gradual improvement in its score since the index began in 1990. In 1990, Morocco had a score of 0.458, in 2000 a score of 0.531, and in 2010 a score of 0.618. While only 1% of Morocco’s population are living below the internationally-recognized poverty line of living on less than $1.90 per day, nearly 5% are living below the country’s national poverty line. Looking beyond monetary poverty, the index estimates that 19% of Moroccans are living in “multidimensional poverty.” The 2019 report focused on inequalities among people. Perhaps the most stark inequalities in Morocco are between men and women in labor force participation and time spent on domestic work. Although 70% of Moroccan men are active in the labor force, only 21% of women are. Meanwhile, women reported they spend over five hours per day on unpaid domestic chores, seven times the time that men spend. The percentage of Morocco’s parliamentary seats held by women is 18%, a percentage not that much higher than the group of women who got married before the age of 18, 13%. Child marriage in Morocco is now illegal unless the families involved obtain a waiver for the marriage. The index highlighted health realities across the world. Nearly one-quarter of pregnant Moroccan women do not have any prenatal visits, and 13% give birth without any “skilled health personnel” present. Morocco only has seven doctors and 11 hospital beds per 10,000 people, according to the index. Children born in Morocco face a life expectancy of 76.5 years. Moroccans who entered their first year of schooling in 2018 can expect to spend an average of 13 years in school, far more than the five years of education the average adult Moroccan has. Adult Moroccan men are more likely to have “some” secondary education than women: 36% of men and 29% of women advanced beyond primary education. UNDP describes 19% of Morocco’s labor force as “skilled” and said 49% are in vulnerable employment. While the wealthiest 10% in Morocco take home 32% of the country’s income, the bottom 40% take home 17%. The index showed that most Moroccans have access to utilities: 100% have electricity and 87% have a basic drinking-water source. However, 19% of Morocco’s land is considered to be “degraded.” On government spending, the UNDP noted that Morocco spends 3% of its GDP on its military.  Morocco also spends 9% of its exports of goods, services, and primary income on repaying its debts.

Rabat – Morocco is set to attend the seventh annual SIAL Middle East 2019 International Food Show in Abu Dhabi from December 9 to 11. The kingdom’s participation in the event, organized by the Agricultural Development Agency (ADA), aims to promote local products within the framework of the Green Morocco Plan (PMV).  The food show is set to welcome 1,000 exhibitors representing 30 countries and more than 16,000 visitors.  The Moroccan pavilion at the food show will present visitors with a rich, colorful, immersive experience with authentic flavors and hospitality. With culinary and cultural events such as cooking shows and tastings, Moroccan cuisine will offer guests a glimpse at the gastronomy and cultural heritage of the North African kingdom. Morocco will display its local products at the show with 25 exhibitors from all regions of Morocco, according to an official press release. Morocco’s exhibitors include 74 agricultural cooperatives with more than 2,466 members, including 422 women.  The event presents an opportunity to demonstrate the great diversity and the dynamism of Morocco in front of 16,000 professionals who are looking for business opportunities, the source added.  Some of the Moroccan products to be featured at the show include a variety of spices, honey, couscous, dates, saffron, olive oil, argan products, almonds, and dried figs.  The PMV considers local products a strategic priority for Moroccan agriculture. Investment in local products allows for sustainable local development, particularly in geographically and economically isolated areas of Morocco.  King Mohammed VI inaugurated the PMV project in April 2008.  The project ultimately aims to make agriculture one of the first sectors of productive development and to modernize it. It also intends to promote agricultural investment, ensure food security, stimulate exports of agricultural products, and promote local products.

Rabat – The Saudi Ministry of Municipalities and Rural Affairs announced that restaurants in Saudi Arabia will no longer need to have entrances segregated by sex. The ministry made the announcement on Twitter on Sunday, December 8. ألغى #تسهيل_الاشتراطات_البلدية

مرتبطة بشاشات.#وزارة_الشؤون_البلدية_والقروية pic.twitter.com/xj9aQRCVdc — وزارة الشؤون البلدية والقروية (@saudimomra) December 8, 2019  The change in rules puts an end to gender restrictions that had been in place for decades. Prior to the change, Saudi Arabia required all restaurants to have two different entrances, one for families and women, and another one for single men. The restriction also banned women from entering restaurants and cafes that are not large enough to apply the separation. The ministry, however, did not specify if the segregated areas inside restaurants will also be eliminated. Men and women who are not related have been banned from sharing public spaces for decades. The new change is not compulsory. Restaurants have the right to maintain the separate entrances if their managers decide to do so, a Saudi official told the press. The rule on separate entrances for schools and hospitals has not been repealed, however. A number of conservative Saudis view gender segregation in public spaces as a religious requirement. Other Muslim countries in the region, however, do not have laws on gender separation. The ministry announced the reform in a list of newly-approved requirements for buildings, schools, stores, and sports centers. The list of decisions aims to attract investments and create greater business opportunities, according to the Saudi administration. This reform is the latest of a series of social reforms launched by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In recent years, the Saudi prince lifted bans on women driving and on public entertainment. He also reduced the powers of the kingdom’s religious police, whose job is to enforce conservative social norms, including separation between genders in public. In August 2019, Saudi Arabia lifted a controversial ban on travel by allowing women to apply for a passport and travel freely, ending a guardianship policy that reduced women’s freedom of travel. The reforms are also part of bin Salman’s “2030 Vision” to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy and to boost tourism’s contribution to the country’s GDP from 3% to 10%. In September, the kingdom launched a new visa program that allows the entry of tourists from 52 countries and territories. Saudi Arabia also relaxed its dress code requirements for foreign women. The wave of reforms comes after years of human rights controversies and the media storm surrounding the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Rabat – An 18-year-old student is in custody after he called Fez police to report a fake bomb threat.  The student falsely reported to police the presence of two bombs inside a home in the Labita neighborhood. Security services reacted quickly to the call, treating it as an emergency. The police opened a thorough investigation into the threat, according to a statement by Morocco’s Directorate General of National Security (DGSN).  The investigation then revealed that the student had made a false report, a crime under Moroccan law.   In November 2015, police arrested two restaurant employees at Morocco Mall in Casablanca for triggering a false bomb threat. The false alarm resulted in the entire mall’s evacuation. Security is a top concern in Morocco, particularly regarding terrorist or bomb threats. In the wake of terror attacks in Casablanca and Marrakech in 2015, Morocco launched its Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), one of the region’s much-lauded security services. The BCIJ has since dismantled dozens of terror cells linked to ISIS. An investigation is underway to determine the student’s motives.

Rabat – Is Ankara resorting to blackmail to stop Morocco from walking out of a Morocco-Turkey Free Trade Agreement the North African country says does not benefit its economy? Last week, Turkish media giant TRT aired a pro-Polisario video clip on the Western Sahara question, an unusual move that suggests that something might be going on between Turkey and Morocco. Titled “Who is Aminatou Haidar, the Ghandi of the Western Sahara?” the video is presented as a concise biography of Haidar, the pro-Polisario and self-determination activist. In the two-minute video, Haidar speaks about putting more pressure on the international community to compel Morocco to leave the “annexed” territories in its south. Although the ongoing UN process in Western Sahara has implicitly disqualified referendum on self-determination as a viable alternative to lasting settlement in the Western Sahara conflict, TRT uncritically quotes Haidara’s thesis that there will not be peace without a referendum. “It is a question of decolonization. It should not be taken out of its legal context,” Haidar says in the clip. She then goes on to stress that Morocco must be made to submit to “international legality” by respecting the UN resolutions on self-determination and the right to return. At that point, TRT describes the Polisario activist as having endured torture and related abuses in a secret Moroccan prison who has yet chosen to spread messages of non-violence and a dialogue-based solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Not so long ago, TRT would not—or would rarely— paint the Western Sahara conflict in such a clearly pro-Polisario light. In most of its previous videos and articles about the conflict, the Turkish media giant was more careful with nuances, sometimes even sounding to be in favor of Morocco. In a video on the berm (the Moroccan defense wall), for instance, TRT refers to the berm area as “Moroccan Western Sahara.” It also described the Polisario Front as “a guerilla group fighting for a separate state.” The Haidar video however, refers to Polisario as “independence fighters.” The change in the framing is significantly indicative of TRT’s agenda, in spite of the usual claims of objectivity. So why the sudden change in framing? With the video coming days after Morocco threatened to walk out of its Free Trade Agreement with Turkey, one easy theory is that TRT’s video is Ankara’s way of striking back and flexing its media muscle to show how much it could hurt Morocco. From this perspective, the video is both a warning and a show of force, with the aim of dissuading Rabat from going any further than it already has in its reported plans to end the FTA with Turkey. Ankara could dismiss the theory by pointing to the independence of TRT’s editorial board, arguing that the media mogul does not get its marching orders from Turkish authorities. But such a denial would be equally easily dismissible. First, TRT is state-owned, and secondly, broad agreement around lack of media freedom in Turkey would easily squash any claims of editorial freedom. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that a Moroccan ally has brought up the Western Sahara dispute when bilateral relations are tense. In February, a Saudi TV channel, Al Arabiya, aired an avowedly pro-Polisario documentary on the Sahara dispute, using concepts like “occupation” and “colonization” to refer to Morocco’s “invasion” of the territories. “Western Sahara is one such ‘no-go zone’ which in the past the Saudis have respected and more or less agree on any way,” a TRT contributor wrote in an op-ed at the time of the Rabat-Riyadh feud. The argument was that, despite Riyadh’s low-key denial that it had anything to do with Al Arabiya’s documentary, the known proximity between the Saudi Royal Court and the channel, as well as the fact that such pro-Polisario narratives would never make it to Saudi television in times of warm relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, suggested otherwise. Much the same could be said of TRT’s abrupt pro-Polisario turn. Meanwhile, on TRT’s YouTube page, many commenters have lamented the Turkish giant’s untraditional pro-Polisario bias, pointing to the similarities between the Sahrawi and Kurdish questions. “Polisario is like PKK to Turkey,” one comment read, appearing to argue that, with Morocco having always distanced itself from any statements condemning Turkey’s position on the Kurdish issue, it was “surprising” that a Turkish television channel would broadcast a video close to Polisario’s claims.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Economy, Finance, and Administration Reform Mohamed Benchaaboun stressed the need to heighten economic integration among Muslim countries on Saturday, December 8, in Istanbul, Turkey.  The Moroccan minister spoke at the opening of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) High-Level Public and Private Investment Conference.   A key objective of the two-day conference is to assess member countries’ investment opportunities and the implications of doing business in the region. The conference invites stakeholders to discuss investments and economic reform in the Muslim world.  Benchaaboun went on to emphasize the need for OIC member countries to improve their investment climate and gain investor confidence, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Doing so will enable OIC member countries to overcome some of the major challenges of development and offer new opportunities to youth in the region.  Regarding the Moroccan experience, Benchaaboun described how the kingdom enhanced its appeal to foreign investments, particularly in the automotive industry, aeronautics, and renewable energies.  Morocco’s growth in this area required structural reforms aimed at strengthening macroeconomic growth. Morocco also simplified administrative procedures, modernized business, and consolidated economic governance in order to improve its business climate.  Morocco announced the launch of a flexible exchange rate for the dirham currency on January 12, 2018. Since Morocco implemented currency reforms, it has become more attractive to foreign investment.   The US Department of State’s 2019 Investment Climate Statement report on Morocco cites the kingdom’s macro-economic policies, trade liberalization, structural reforms, infrastructure improvements, and investor incentives as selling points to foreign investors.  Benchaaboun added that Morocco developed its financial framework by consolidating capital markets, diversifying financial tools, and facilitating companies’ access to financing.

 Rabat – The National Federation of Independent Dentists Union in Morocco (FNSMD) have announced a nationwide strike on Monday, January 13, 2020, and a protest in front of the Ministry of Health’s headquarters in Rabat. FNSMD made the announcement on Saturday, December 7. Posted by Fnsmd Privé on Saturday, 7 December 2019 The dentists’ union denounces “those who practice dental medicine illegally” and “urges for tax fairness as provided by the constitution,” according to a press release. The federation also announced a press conference on Thursday, January 2, to “expose the causes of this crisis and solicit dentists to mobilize and participate en masse in the national strike” planned for January 13. The planned strike is the latest part of a series of demonstrations that have taken place throughout 2019. Doctors, nurses, and employees of the health sector, in general, have organized numerous protests to improve their work conditions. On October 22, the National Federation for Health, affiliated with the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGTM), announced a strike at Rabat’s University Hospital, one of the country’s largest hospitals. Earlier that month, the Independent Syndicate of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP) also organized a national strike covering all Moroccan public hospitals.

Rabat – For the third year in a row, Moroccans remain the foreign community that received the most Spanish citizenships in 2018, making up 16.7% of Spain’s newest citizens. Around 15,398 Moroccans became Spanish citizens last year, according to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics. Moroccans received more than three quarters of the Spanish citizenships granted to African immigrants. Immigrants of African nationalities received 20,478 Spanish citizenships in 2018. The Spanish institute denied rumors accusing Spanish authorities of giving Moroccans preferential treatment in decision making. The organization affirmed that all applicants for Spanish citizenship need to pass a test in language, culture, and politics. The number of Moroccans with dual-nationality living in Spain reached 238,000 people. However, the number of Moroccans living illegally in Spain is even larger, estimated at 250,000. In 2017, Spanish authorities granted citizenship to 17,082 Moroccans, representing 25.7% of all naturalized immigrants during that year. In 2016, about 28,505 Moroccans received a Spanish citizenship. The Spanish institute justifies the decline in the number of naturalized Moroccans in recent years with the large amount of applications from South American immigrants. A significant number of immigrants from Latin America flee their countries because of socio-political crises and travel to Spain because of their shared language. In 2017, Spanish authorities naturalized 7,307 immigrants from Ecuador, 6,124 Bolivians, and 5,647 Colombians. Spain naturalizes thousands of immigrants every year, in an effort to curb the aging of its population that threatens pension funds.

Rabat – A man checked in to the University Hospital of Cruces in the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain after showing signs of necrosis, dying body tissue, in his forearm. Hospital officials have not yet confirmed the root of the man’s symptoms, but Osakidetza, the Basque Country’s public healthcare system, suspects that it is a case of rabies.   Multiple Spanish-language news outlets are reporting that the man claims to have been bitten on the forearm by a cat during a trip to Morocco in August. Given the evolution of the man’s symptoms and his stint in Morocco, a country affected by rabies, the decay in his arm may be due to a rabies infection.   Rabies is a viral infection that can be spread to humans by infected animals through bites and scratches. The virus targets the brain and spinal cord. If left untreated, rabies is fatal.  Although rabies is present on all continents except Antarctica, the disease is most commonly transmitted to humans in developing countries throughout Asia and Africa. Rabies can be present in both domestic animals and wildlife.  Symptoms of rabies infections in humans usually appear one to three months after the bite or scratch occurs. However, symptoms can emerge just days after exposure to the virus.  Symptoms include fever, anxiety, hyperactivity, convulsions, and delirium. At the wound site, patients feel pain or a tingling sensation. Patients suffering from rabies may also develop a fear of feeling moving air and swallowing liquids. In some cases, patients are paralyzed and fall into a coma.  After symptoms appear, affected patients often die within one or two weeks.  There are around 59,000 cases of rabies in humans globally each year, according to the World Health Organization.  In November 2018, a British tourist died after contracting rabies from a cat bite sustained in Morocco. Public Health England (PHE) then released a statement warning travelers to avoid contact with animals when traveling to rabies-affected countries. “This is an important reminder of the precautions people should take when traveling to countries where rabies is present. If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal you must wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay,” the PHE statement advised.

Rabat – Israeli airline El Al is looking to open a direct flight route between Israel and Morocco, according to reports circulating in  Israeli media. El Al’s CEO Gonen Usishkin travelled to Morocco in June 2019 for a tourism conference. While at the event, Usishkin met with officials from Royal Air Maroc to discuss the idea, according to Yisrael Hayom. Moroccan media are speculating that the launch of direct flights between the two countries could be as soon as May. If the launch goes ahead, the flight would be the first route linking Casablanca and Tel Aviv. However, El Al has not released a statement confirming the rumors. Currently, there are no direct flights between Morocco and Israel. People travelling between the two countries usually make a stop at a connecting airport before reaching their destination. Israeli media recalled a 2018 interview with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita when he said that Morocco welcomes Israeli tourists. “Unlike other Arab countries, Jews and Israelis are no strangers to us. The Jews were always friends and neighbors,” said the minister. Morocco welcomes thousands of Israelis every year who visit the kingdom for tourism or religious pilgrimages. The majority of Israelis who visit the country have Moroccan roots. There are also about 2,000 Jews currently living in Morocco. Morocco regularly affirms its support for the Palestinian people and is not considering normalization of diplomatic relations with Israel. Before the recent visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Morocco, on Thursday, December 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to join the US official. However, King Mohammed VI rejected the Israeli official’s request according to the Times of Israel.

Rabat – The low-cost carrier Tui Fly has canceled three flights between Morocco and Spain: Nador to Alicante, Nador to Madrid, and Casablanca to Madrid. The Belgian airline opened the flights along with six others in the summer of 2019, but its parent group has decided the three flights did not have enough passengers to be profitable, according to Moroccan outlet Bladi. While Casablanca will lose its Tui flight to Madrid, it recently gained a new flight to Milan, Italy. Tui also plans to open a flight  from Casablanca to Barcelona next summer as the low-cost carrier searches for its niche in the Moroccan market, reports French outlet Air Journal. Tui Fly is still operating flights from 10 cities in Morocco: Oujda, Nador, Al Hoceima, Tangier, Tetouan, Fez, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakech, and Agadir. From Nador, a city in northeast Morocco, customers can still buy Tui tickets to France (Lille), the Netherlands (Antwerp and Eindhoven), and Belgium (Brussels). Tui fly competes with Ryanair and Air Arabia Maroc for cost-conscious passengers in Nador. The airport also has flights with Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, and Malta Air. Passengers traveling from Morocco’s busiest airport, Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca, will have the option to fly to Spain (Barcelona and Alicante), France (Paris, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Lorraine, and Lille), Belgium (Brussels), and Italy (Milan).

Rabat – Young people are adding more color to Morocco than the traditional red and green of the nation’s flag. In an environment where young people may feel unable to express themselves, it is not difficult to imagine that they may feel constrained and trapped by their emotions. However, there are ways other than through words to express what they feel. Founded in Mexico, Martin Olivier Gonzalez, 18, introduced his project, Proyectarte Internacional, to the Mohammed Ben Abdesalam Sayah middle school in the Rabat Medina. Meaning “express yourself,” Proyectarte aims to empower young people who have suffered through art, specifically painting.  Olivier Gonzalez states that not only have these young people come from backgrounds of extreme poverty, orphanages, and other difficult situations, but many have also lost sight of their future.  Olivier Gonzalez told Morocco World News that these young people “lose courage to pursue their dreams, chase money rather than happiness, follow someone else’s expectations, or follow what they think is right, but is actually not. They don’t follow their heart.”  Under Olivier Gonzalez’s NGO social association, “Ualis” meaning “It’s possible,” Proyectarte shows young people that they can, in fact, lead successful lives and achieve anything if they put their heart into it.  Ten students from Mohammed Ben Abdesalam Sayah middle school who had experienced extreme poverty, domestic abuse, or trouble at home, volunteered to participate in Proyectarte over the past three months.  According to Olivier Gonzalez, the students seemed like they didn’t know what they were getting into at first: “They thought they were just going to get painting classes.”  Olivier Gonzalez admitted that they started with ten students and ended with seven, because three dropped out as the project turned out to be “something different.”  The methods of Proyectarte were developed in Mexico with Olivier Gonzalez’s mother, a professional coach and an established painter, Emilio Pazos. Over the span of ten classes, students learned to express themselves in three phases. The first phase was called “exploration” or an “introduction to painting.”   Olivier Gonzalez and his team showed the students that they didn’t need to know how to use a brush to paint. The students became familiar with painting techniques, color combinations, and materials. Olivier Gonzalez stressed that Proyectarte is “for people who have never painted before.”  The second phase was called “Theory and Deepening of Art.”  On a slideshow, Olivier Gonzalez and his team displayed famous paintings with brief backgrounds of their respective artists. The students then chose a word that they associated with that piece. For example, one of the slides included a work by Van Gogh in which the student associated with “craziness,” a recognizable characteristic Gogh’s works.  Through such exercises, students built empathy between themselves and the painter and could answer the question, “What do you have in common with the artist?” Olivier Gonzalez answered, that “heart, passion, and story is what everyone has in common.”  The last phase was called “The Creative Process,” where the students finally got the chance to express themselves on canvas.  Each student was asked to find images that inspired them in what they wished to express. After, the students verbally discussed with Olivier Gonzalez and his team how and why they wanted to achieve that inspiration through painting. The students then painted their idea on a small, test canvas and moved to the larger, final canvas when they felt ready.  Each students’ final paintings were put on display at a public auction in Bab Chellah on November 29. Each canvas was sold raising more than $700. Some of the funds will pay for one year of painting classes for the students, while the rest of the funds will go to NGO Ualis. Olivier Gonzalez explained that by the end of Proyectarte, students learned the value of their art and that if they are “persistent, honest, and willing to put their heart into something, they can achieve any goal.” Olivier Gonzalez further explained that the students could now physically see their own expressions on canvas which is an important step toward self-empowerment.  Proyectarte’s successful turnout in Rabat empowered youths and instilled a new sense of hope and perspective of life through art.  In a video filmed after the students finished the project, one boy said that Proyectarte “taught him that he can achieve anything” and told others to “dream big, because everyone can reach their dreams.”  Proyectarte hopes to establish three more projects in Morocco within the next year as well as in England, Portugal, and Mexico. Olivier Gonzalez hopes that Proyectarte will eventually branch out to all corners of the world to “transform the lives of young adults through art.”

Rabat – Morocco and the International Energy Agency (IEA) signed an action plan for the period of 2020-2021, on Friday, December 6, in Paris. The plan aims to improve bilateral cooperation in terms of energy security and renewable energies. IEA is an autonomous intergovernmental organization that focuses on energy security, economic development, and environmental protection. It also aims to mitigate the effects of climate change. Morocco became an associate member of the IEA in November 2016. The new action plan will answer Morocco’s needs for transitioning into a low-carbon economy. Morocco’s Minister of Energy, Mines, and Environment Aziz Rabbah signed the document during his meeting with IEA’s Executive Director, Fatih Birol. Birol commended the “growing importance” of Morocco, both regionally and internationally, in the field of energy. The cooperation between Morocco and the IEA will concern strategy, databases, access to information related to world energy, and the development of the agency on the regional level, Rabbah told the press. Morocco is a logistic partner of the agency with its strategic geoposition and well-developed infrastructure. The kingdom is ranked 17th in the world in terms of maritime connection and plays an important role in international energy security, added the minister. Rabbah participated on Wednesday, December 4, in the first meeting of the recently-created High-Level Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency. He also took part in the IEA’s ministerial conference on Thursday, December 5. Cooperation between Morocco and the IEA started in 2007 in the fields of energy policies and research and development statistics. Two years later, Morocco launched a national plan aiming to develop wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. The two parties previously signed an action plan on June 28, 2017, for the period of 2017-2019. According to Rabbah, the plan was a success, which led to the signing of the new 2020-2021 accord. Morocco’s national energy strategy aims to reach 52% of electricity consumption based on renewable energy by 2030. Since the launch of the strategy in 2009, Morocco has heavily invested in renewable energy with projects such as Noor Ouarzazate, the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The Noor Ouarzazate complex encompasses more than 3,000 hectares of land in the Sahara Desert. It cost an investment of $400 million in loans from the World Bank and an additional $216 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

Rabat – A group of Chinese academics criticized the Modern Standard Arabic (Fus’ha) fluency of their Moroccan counterparts during a scientific conference. Modern Standard Arabic refers to a variety of Arabic that developed in the Arab World in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of Morocco’s official languages and it is taught in Moroccan schools. “We thank our colleague for his intervention, despite not understanding anything,” said a Chinese moderator in fluent Arabic, following the French-spoken intervention of a Moroccan economist. The moderator’s comment created laughter among the international attendees. “I do not speak French, I only speak Chinese, Arabic, and some English. I don’t know anything about French,” continued the Chinese academic, while the audience’s laughter started to fade out. An online footage, uploaded recently, shows the scene and captures the embarrassment of the Moroccan professor who could not make an intervention in Arabic.  The scene took place during the 5th International Academic Conference between China and Morocco, an event moderated in Arabic. Academics from China and Morocco participated in the conference. In a second clip, another Chinese moderator asks a Moroccan professor to present his intervention in Arabic, the language of the event. However, the Moroccan academic expresses his inability to do so. He asks a second participant to interpret his speech from French to Arabic. The videos attracted several mocking comments, criticizing Moroccans for not being fluent in their “native” language. While Modern Standard Arabic is taught in Moroccan schools and used in administrations, it is not what Moroccans speak in daily life. The mother tongues in Morocco are Darija, an Arabic dialect, and Amazigh, in its different variations. The academic conference took place on November 23 at the Hassan II University library in Casablanca. It discussed the role of Morocco as a strategic partner for cooperation between China and Africa. Hassan II University co-organized the event with Casablanca’s Confucius Institute and Shanghai International Studies University. The nonfluency of Moroccans in languages, including Arabic, can be linked to Morocco’s education system. A recent report from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) placed Morocco 75th out of 79 countries that participated in an international assessment that evaluates students’ abilities in reading, mathematics, and science. While Moroccans ranked far below the international average in all three criteria, Chinese students ranked at the top of each one of them. Another report, published in November 2018 by the World Bank, outlined deficiencies in Morocco’s educational system. The organization noted that the learning method used in Moroccan schools makes students unable to exhibit a basic understanding of day-to-day knowledge application.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister Delegate for African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli reiterated Morocco’s position on the Libyan crisis. Since the fall of Muammar al-Gaddafi’s regime in 2011, Morocco has rejected all foreign intervention in Libya that “hinders the signing of an agreement between the different Libyan parties.” Jazouli expressed the Moroccan stance during a meeting between ministerial delegations from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Chad, Egypt, and Sudan. The meeting took place on Friday, December 6, in Rome, Italy, and aimed to discuss the situation of Libya. “Rabat follows with a lot of concern the situation of this sister country and its consequences, be it in terms of human casualties or its impact on the stability of the country and the whole region,” said Jazouli during the meeting. “Morocco has one objective; that of seeing Libyans achieve a dialogue and succeed in the process of national reconciliation to restore peace and stability,” added the Moroccan official. The minister delegate also affirmed that, for Rabat, the only legitimate party in Libya is the Government of National Accord, presided by Fayez al-Sarraj. The Government of National Accord was formed on December 17, 2015, in Skhirat, Morocco, as a UN-led initiative. Libya is the scene of a civil war between forces of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. Foreign forces such as the US and Russia are also part of the conflict. The meeting between delegations from Libya’s neighboring countries occurred on the sidelines of the Rome MED 2019 conference. The conference took place between December 5 and December 7. During the two-day event, the Moroccan minister delegate promoted Morocco’s peacekeeping capabilities. “Morocco acts in its region by adopting a diplomacy based on responsibility and clarity,” said Jazouli at a panel on collaboration in the MENA region. The official described Morocco’s development model as based on democratic institutions, economic growth, and inclusive human development. The Skhirat agreement, according to Jazouli, is a major example of Morocco’s peace-building initiatives.

Rabat – Muhammad and Aaliyah are the tenth most popular names for boys and girls in the US, according to new data from the baby name database “BabyCenter.” Muhammad entered the top ten rankings for boy’s names the first time. Its rank on the BabyCenter list includes the various spellings of Muhammad such as Mohamed and Mohammad.  The data comes from nearly 600,000 parents who shared their baby’s name with the organization in 2019.  Aaliyah also entered BabyCenter’s top ten rankings for girl’s names in 2019. Other spellings include Alia and Aliyah.  Aaliyah is the feminine form of the name Ali, which means “high” and “exalted.” Ali is an important name in Islam. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad.  Muhammad: The world’s most common name In the UK, Muhammad is the most popular name for boys for the third year in a row.   Mohamed is a popular name in Spain, in part thanks to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in Morocco. It’s also a particularly common name in France, where immigrants from Muslim nations throughout the Middle East and Africa make up a large portion of the country’s immigrant community.   BabyCenter reports that names of Arabic origin are on the rise outside of the Arabic-speaking and Muslim world as ethnic and religious demographics continue to shift throughout the West.  “Muslim families often choose Muhammad for firstborn sons to honor the prophet and bring blessings to the child,” said Linda Murray, BabyCenter’s global editor in chief. “The name also has multiple spellings, and that helps a name get into the top 10.” In addition to religious reasons, families draw inspiration from professional athletes in choosing the name Muhammad for their baby boy.  The US Social Security Administration compiles the same list using records of all babies born in the US. However, this popularity list treats each unique spelling as a separate name.  The administration has not yet released its own list, but Muhammad ranked at 345 in 2018, jumping 275 places from its rank at 620 in 2000. Alternate spellings receive separate rankings. In Morocco, Mohammed is the most popular boy’s name, followed by Youssef, Hamza, Omar, Amine, Karim, Mehdi, Yassine, Zakaria, and Ali.  Muhammad and its variations are likely the most popular given names in the world, according to the Columbia Encyclopedia. An estimated 150 million men and boys share this name. It is among the most common given names in every country throughout the Middle East and North Africa, including Israel.

Rabat – Morocco’s national plan to combat the upcoming cold wave is in full swing. In the province of Taourirt, in the eastern Rif Mountains, local leaders held a meeting to evaluate and monitor the measures that will be taken to deal with the cold wave and snowfall. Representatives of local authorities, heads of regional departments of relevant ministries, and military officials attended the meeting, Hespress reported.  Governor Larbi Touijer chaired the meeting on Friday, December 6. Attendees first evaluated the provincial action plan to mitigate the negative effects of the cold snap on the local population, particularly in rural and remote areas.  While addressing the meeting, Touijer said that provincial authorities have developed a plan of action to identify the most at-risk areas. In about 13 villages, the top priority is to build shelters for homeless people and to monitor road conditions. These rural villages have an elevation of 1500 meters and include Sidi Lahcen, Tanchorfi, Sidi Ali Belkacem, Laatef, and Ouled Mohamed.  The villages concerned are home to 6,151 people. The Regional Directorate of Water and Forests has distributed 6,000 kilograms of firewood and more than 7,000 kilograms of charcoal to heat 143 local classrooms.   The province is set to mobilize five heliports when necessary, such as in the case of medical emergencies. The province is also prepared to use human resources and snow removal equipment to keep roads and trails accessible. Basic needs such as food, blankets, and shelter are to be identified and met, according to Hespress. The Regional Directorate of Agriculture aims to protect livestock during the winter and distributed more than two million kilograms of fodder to 6,700 beneficiaries. The meeting called for another two million kilograms of fodder for livestock in the region.  Additionally, the meeting discussed guaranteeing health coverage to the inhabitants of high-risk areas.  All logistical equipment and human resources must be mobilized, the governor stated, in order for protective services to be effective.  Morocco’s Ministry of Interior established a national plan for the fight against cold waves in 2007. The 2019-2020 plan will cover more than 736,000 Moroccans living in 1,753 remote villages, dispersed over 27 different provinces. The plan includes supplying the target villages with commodities, heating, and livestock feed, as well as linking them to telecommunication systems. Also included in the vision is the deployment of medical units of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces in the towns of Azilal and Midelt, a mobile hospital in the town of Imilchil (central Morocco), as well as medical caravans and field visits to all the target villages. Despite the mobilization of a national plan, individual provinces such as Taourirt are taking extra measures to ensure the safety of their residents.

Rabat – The proliferation of illegal tourist guides as well as the lack of strict implementation of existing regulations are driving down the number of Chinese tourists coming to Morocco, clouding the future of a trend that was recently touted as the most promising of Morocco’s tourism industry. In September of this year, Morocco’s tourism ministry signed a “co-marketing partnership” with Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency. The partnership aims to promote Chinese tourism in Morocco. Later commenting on that agreement, Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani expressed confidence at the prospect of Morocco’s China-focused tourism.  “We are waiting for more Chinese tourists to visit Morocco in the future,” El Othmani said. “The tourism cooperation between the two countries is of great significance and will enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples and lay a foundation for further strengthening bilateral relations,.” he continued. Morocco attracted 200,000 Chinese tourists in 2018 alone, a steep increase from the 100,000 Chinese tourists who visited the country in the previous year. The 100% increase surged optimism among Moroccan authorities, leading to expectations that the country could attract as many as 500,000 Chinese tourists by 2020. In recent months, however, there has been a steady decrease in the number of Chinese tourists to Morocco. From 200,000 in 2018, the number has plummeted down to 190,000 this year, making the projection of welcoming “500,000 Chinese tourists by 2020” projections an unattainable target. Speaking to Moroccan news outlet Media24, Hayat Jabrane, owner of a tourism agency that caters especially to Chinese tourists, pointed accusatory fingers at the relaxed implementation of tourism regulation. This, she argued, has allowed for the rapid—and concerning—proliferation of illegal travel agencies. “If in 2019 we’ve received fewer Chinese tourists than in 2018, it is because the informal market has been having the upper hand on specialized, authorized tourism agencies,” she explained. She said that the unauthorized agencies are mostly run by Chinese nationals with scant knowledge of Moroccan history and culture. In addition to not having the legal documents to work as tourism guides, she explained, they do not have the minimum cultural knowledge and professional training to operate in the industry. “These people who know nothing of Morocco or its history come here for three months to guide groups of Chinese tourists who then go back home unsatisfied and sometimes even disgusted with the kingdom,” Jabrane said. “How can these fake guides do the work properly when they have no knowledge whatsoever of Moroccan history, of Morocco’s cultural heritage, and even of local [touristic] products?” “And so, what is initially sold to [Chinese] tourists as guided visits end up being scams,” Jabrane continued. “As Chinese tourists are mostly interested in cultural tourism, they leave Morocco unsatisfied and frustrated. And once in China, they will surely discourage their entourage [from traveling to Morocco].” But Jabrane was not irreversibly pessimistic about the future of Chinese tourism to Morocco. She insisted, however, that for the country to hit its target number of Chinese tourists, Morocco needs to effectively implement the industry’s existing regulations. She also expressed hope that the newly appointed (and lauded) tourism minister, will “have sufficient time to tackle this issue.” Part of the solution, she argued, lies in being strict with controls and other regulations. “When a bus with 40 Chinese tourists arrives at the Hassan II Mosque,” she explained, “the tourism police should ask the group’s guide to show his or her credentials, including the name of the travel agency he or she works for, work permit, etc.” “Knowing the fake tourist guides usually have a three-month visa, people with no valid credentials should be arrested and prevented from ruining the tourism industry.” There is, however, the fact that the number of professional, licensed guides who speak Mandarin is very low, even insignificant in Morocco. For all the waves of Chinese tourists who visited Morocco in recent years, the kingdom still only has 40 licensed, trained guides who can sufficiently serve this demographic. Jabrane says that number is “very insufficient” to meet the demands of “hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists.” On that front, she argued that Moroccan authorities have a responsibility to invest in language and cultural training, if the country is to remain a competitive and coveted destination for the wave of middle-class Chinese tourists eager to discover different cultures.

Rabat – Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to join US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on his Morocco trip, but King Mohammed VI rejected the idea, Israeli television has revealed. Channel 12, an Israeli TV outlet, reported on December 6 that Netanyahu, who is understood to be very keen on achieving a historic diplomatic breakthrough with “moderate Arab countries,” including Morocco, reportedly used his December 4 meeting in Lisbon with Mike Pompeo to offer to join the US diplomat on his half-day visit to Rabat on December 5. The Moroccan monarch, however, “vetoed the idea,” Channel 12 reported according to the Times of Israel who cited Moroccan diplomatic sources. The report provides no further details, but it is understood that the inclusion of Israel normalization talks, as well as the Moroccan King’s refusal to host Netanyahu or even discuss Israel may have had something to do with some last-minute changes in Pompeo’s agenda that cut short his visit to Morocco. The first change hit when Pompeo, who was expected for a two-day visit in Rabat, from December 4-6, shortened his visit to the afternoon of December 6. Even more significant is the fact that a day before coming to Morocco, Pompeo flew to Lisbon where he met Netanyahu. Reports later came out that Pompeo and Netanyahu discussed normalization between Morocco and Israel, with Channel 12 again indicating that the Israeli PM was hoping for “a real diplomatic achievement” with Rabat in “the next few days.” More notable still, there was a sudden change in Pompeo’s official schedule while in Rabat. The US secretary of state was due to meet with King Mohammed VI in the afternoon and then join him for a royal dinner in the evening. But Pompeo only met with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, FM Nasser Bourita, and DGSN chief Abdellatif Hammouchi. Pompeo left Rabat before the initially scheduled dinner and meeting with King Mohammed. But senior US officials are casting doubts on such reports, saying that Rabat-Tel Aviv normalization was never part of Pompeo’s Moroccan agenda. It wasn’t a topic of discussion,” a State Department official said in a press briefing after the visit. The official went to describe the news as “just another Israeli leak to the press of their own issue.” Meanwhile, sources in Netanyahu’s close circle have dismissed reports of the Israeli PM asking to join Pompeo in the Morocco visit. They have called the story “lies.” According to official statements from the Department of State, Pompeo’s talks with his Moroccan hosts were mainly about regional security (especially Iran and the growing fragility in the Sahel), cooperation on counter-terrorism, as well as driving up US-Morocco bilateral trade and investments. “The US has a great friend in Morocco,” Pompeo tweeted after his meeting with Head of Government El Othmani. “We look forward to improving our trade and finance cooperation as well as strengthening our development partnership to support Morocco’s effort to grow its economy.”

Rabat – Mohcine Jazouli, Morocco’s Minister Delegate for African Cooperation, spoke of Morocco’s peace-building capabilities at the Rome MED 2019 conference in Rome, Italy.  MED is a year-long initiative for high-level dialogue on issues in the Mediterranean. The two-day conference in Rome began wrapping up its 5th installment today, December 7.  “Morocco acts in its region by adopting a diplomacy based on responsibility and clarity,” Jazouli said at a panel on collaboration in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).  Morocco’s diplomacy “aims to reinforce ties in a spirit of brotherhood and solidarity with all the brotherly . . . countries, which has enabled the Kingdom to become a credible partner in building peace,” he continued.  Jazouli underlined how Morocco has successfully laid the foundations for a model of national development under King Mohammed VI, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The minister described Morocco’s development model as based on democratic institutions, economic growth, and inclusive human development.  Morocco has taken several initiatives aimed at developing political, economic, and diplomatic ties in the region, Jazouli continued. He cited Morocco’s Skhirat agreement on Libya’s political transition, signed in 2015, as an example of the kingdom’s peace-building initiatives. Jazouli went on to discuss trade, noting the Agadir agreement of 2001. Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan signed the Agadir agreement with the aim of increasing exports to the European Union and essentially creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone. Regarding diplomacy, Jazouli stressed the conflicts and socio-economic tensions that plague the MENA region. MENA, however, has valuable assets that can facilitate development, Jazouli said. Sustainable partnerships in the region are vital to sustain intra-regional trade and diverse economies. Italian FM highlights strategic partnership After Jazouli’s speech, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi De Maio took the stand.  De Maio lauded Morocco’s role in upholding stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean, according to MAP. He highlighted Italy’s multidimensional strategic agreement with Morocco, which includes bilateral cooperation on security issues. Morocco and Italy signed the strategic cooperation agreement on November 1, in line with the goals of King Mohammed VI to diversify Morocco’s foreign partnerships with the EU and strengthen ties with Italy.  The text of the strategic partnership sets up mechanisms, defines areas of cooperation, and strengthen bilateral coordination on various issues. A key priority of the partnership is to peacefully settle regional disputes and conflicts while ensuring cooperation between Africa and the Mediterranean. The partnership further aims to promote dialogue and cooperation in combatting terrorism, international crime, and irregular migration.   At the political level, Morocco and Italy share an interest in crisis resolution and migration management. The Italian foreign minister praised Morocco on November 1 for its effective migration policies, calling the Kingdom a source of inspiration for the European Union and Mediterranean countries.  Italy is set to benefit greatly from the partnership in terms of security and migration. For Morocco, the agreement will stimulate economic growth in the Kingdom and promote cooperation with other European countries.

Rabat – Morocco’s House of Advisors (the upper house of the Moroccan parliament) has approved the government’s 2020 Appropriation Bill amid consistent royal directives to reduce the country’s persisting socio-economic disparities and improve national performance in education and research. The text, approved on December 6 by a majority of 37 voices for and 24 against, aims to improve the country’s economic climate while pushing for the reduction of socio-economic disparities, as well as investments in inclusive and qualitative education and research. The bill “mainly aims to support social programs, reduce disparities, accelerate the implementation of advanced regionalization, stimulate investment and promote entrepreneurship,” state-owned outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. In remarks after the parliamentary session, Mohamed Benchaaboun, Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance, expressed satisfaction with the bill. He highlighted the government’s efforts to effectively implement most of the latest royal instructions with regards to inclusive social programs and education, as well as a vibrant and open business sector. Benchaaboun praised the House of Councilors for the “positive climate” of the parliamentary debates around the bill. He said he was particularly satisfied that the house approved many of the amendments introduced by the government. Out of a total of 205 amendments submitted, he explained, 100 were withdrawn and 44 were accepted, a success rate of 43%. Following approval by the House of Councilors, however, the bill “will be submitted to the House of Representatives (lower house) to complete the adoption procedure,” MAP noted. Inclusive education, youth entrepreneurship and employment, as well as the reduction of Morocco’s decades-long, widening social disparities have been of particular for King Mohammed VI, with the Moroccan monarch insisting in all his latest speeches on the need to “complete the ongoing reforms” and “correct the shortcomings.” “Over the years, we have not always done as we wished. But today we are determined to stay on course, capitalize on our achievements, complete the ongoing dynamics of reforms, and address the shortcomings,” the King promised in this year’s Throne Day speech.

Rabat – The Court of Appeal of Salé has handed prison sentences ranging from three to four years to three individuals on terrorism-related charges. Two of the defendants were planning to join ISIS in Syria. The Court’s Criminal Chamber in charge of terrorism cases has tried the three individuals in separate cases for incitement to commit terrorist acts and apology for terrorist organizations.  The first case involved a 30-year-old native of Tangier, who received a three-year prison sentence for promoting ISIS ideology and apology for terrorism. Investigations have shown that the accused had pledged allegiance to terrorist organizations in Syria. In addition to having been an active member on social networks, investigations also revealed that the 30-year-old defendant had decided to travel to Syria to support ISIS by fighting the Allied forces. The accused told investigators that he had changed his mind due to fear. The second case concerns a man from Meknes who was sentenced to four years in prison for promoting the extremist ideology.  The investigation revealed that his cell phone contained photos and videos of dangerous ISIS terror operations. The accused was also planning to travel to Syria and had even started travel arrangements by saving money and obtaining the necessary documents. But his plan failed when he discovered that the Turkish-Syrian borders were closed. The court sentenced the accused on charges of supporting a terrorist organization, apology, and incitement to terrorism.  The court sentenced the third accused to four years in prison for apology and incitement to commit terrorist acts. The judicial police of Sale arrested him last April when investigations revealed that he has links to extremists.  The investigation also showed that the defendant had created a Facebook account to disseminate extremism and videos of terrorist acts in an effort to incite young people to join terrorist organizations.

London – “Wouldn’t it be beautiful to have a swan song of our own? A ‘Swan Lake’ of our own? telling our own story, speaking on our behalf and deconstructing the story of our own lake?” were the thoughts that came to me while watching and analyzing the 2019 short film “The Swan Song.” The film, devoid of any dialogue, is director Yazid El Kadiri’s third. El Kadiri is currently working on a documentary with Al Jazeera. The movie’s story consists of a young man walking in the tiny streets of the old medina (walled city) in Fez, Morocco; he walks into a big old traditional house that was turned into a center for Cross Cultural Studies. The movie’s sole character walks around the house, up and down, around and around, until he finds a group of musicians that plays with. When the melody is just right, the bomb in the young man’s backpack explodes. Viewed in much of the film from the back, the young man has been holding onto the backpack dearly and frustratedly sometimes. His looks were meek, but his steps were steady. It seemed like a walk towards the unknown, towards one’s own self. He was lost, but he acted like he was sure of his destination, as if he knew what was going on inside and outside of himself. The title, “Swan Song,” took me straight away to the tunes from “Swan Lake,” a Russian ballet composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in the late 1800s, to the graceful waltz in Act I, to the playful “Dance of the Cygnets,” to that innocent music—especially because the look on the young man’s face is calm and rather peaceful. Understood as a tremendously artistic show of the endless battle between good and bad, the ballet scenario was fashioned from Russian and German folk tales and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer’s curse. The young man in “The Swan Song” was moving through an imaginary landscape, through a beautiful image and promising colors. The people were wearing different masks, without showing symbols of good or bad, giving the film a flat dramatic structure. I considered the dance as a demonstration for the binary oppositions possible in the plot. But wouldn’t it be more meaningful to have a ballerina dancing freely to the “Swan Lake” songs showing how suppression and conservative ways of thinking and living are smothering her beautiful “swan” lady’s neck. Singing or playing a tune in harmony seems to be extremely difficult at times. Even if that harmony is reached, keeping it alive and true is the main test of sustainability, personally and collectively. “The Swan Song” was beautifully tragic and the tune was lost, like the key to a drawer where the story is “hidden” in hopes of being found some day.

Casablanca – Teaching reading comprehension has always concerned me. How can I track my students’ understanding while they are reading? In grammar, we, as teachers, can check understanding through exercises to have an idea of  how well students grasp the grammatical structure. However, in teaching reading and asking comprehension questions, we might have an idea about the “product” (answers to comprehension questions), but we have no idea about the process. How do we measure and check students’ thinking while reading? I wanted to have a process that leads to the right product. This concern made me start searching for solutions and trying different strategies to see which one would enable me to track my students’ understanding and, at the same time, which one is suitable for the Moroccan context. As my process illustrates, being concerned is a path that leads to professional development. Being concerned with reading comprehension made me reflect on my way of teaching as a whole. I believe that teachers should always adopt a reflective mindset, and reflection permits teachers to follow their interests and their needs as they examine what they and their students do. To put it another way, every teacher should be a researcher. Being a teacher-researcher is highly important for teachers who are concerned with their professional development. Turning the classroom into a laboratory for experimenting with new strategies and analyzing one’s own practices is fundamental for teachers to become the directors of their own professional development. Classrooms are complicated social communities. Students come to them with their own assemblage of native language and culture, proficiency level, learning style, motivation, and attitudes toward language learning. Teachers have their own distinctive styles and use many different materials and teaching techniques in the course of a single classroom session. Teachers play their tune and expect students to dance. Instead of setting ready-made classroom rules, why not share about concerns? Students are worried about their education, and teachers are worried about their way of delivering lessons. Before each class, we, as teachers, should ask: “What will my students teach me today?” The answer to that question can only be attained through listening to, observing, and asking students about how the lesson went and how to make it better. Living the classroom life with students can provide new insights into how much our students can teach us. There should always be a notebook to document reflections and ideas. It is like reading and making inferences, but it is teaching and writing reflections. Studying the notes plays a major role in the teachers’ professional development and makes them innovators and agents of school change. Both research and reflection are essential to refine one’s teaching. Research encourages teachers to escape the “echo chamber” situation in which they merely know what is going on in their own classroom and school. Teachers who do research find that it widens and enriches their teaching skills. By the same token, students are also a source of learning for teachers. Teachers should not overlook the role of students as valuable assets who complete the puzzle of professional development. Being concerned with what works and why might be frustrating and discouraging in some cases, but what makes the differences is a willingness to develop and to break out of the comfort zone.

Rabat – Following the persisting Israel-Morocco normalization hype that recently clouded Mike Pompeo’s visit to Morocco, senior voices from Washington are now dispelling the normalization narrative, discrediting reports that Rabat-Tel Aviv rapprochement was part and parcel of the US’s agenda with Morocco. A day before Pompeo’s much-awaited Rabat visit, reports were rampant that the US official would use his discussions with senior Moroccan officials to push for a historic breakthrough in Rabat-Tel Aviv relations. In addition to the establishing of formal, official diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel, the reports insisted, normalization would entail the signing of a non-belligerence agreement between the two countries, thereby ending Morocco’s policy of constant support for the Palestinian cause. But Pompeo discussed neither Israel nor normalization with any of the top Moroccan officials he met during his one-day stint in Rabat, as indicated in a statement from the US State Department. According to statements from senior US officials, not only was normalization never discussed between Pompeo and his Moroccan hosts, the whole narrative was in fact an Israeli media move to attract substantial attention to something that was never on Pompeo’s agenda as he visited Morocco. “It wasn’t a topic of discussion,” one senior US official said in a press briefing after Pompeo’s visit, referring to the normalization reports. The official went further than discrediting the reports, however. He suggested that the normalization fuss was most probably a deliberate move by Israeli media (and officials) to push forth an issue that is important to them. When he read in Israeli media that normalization would be the center of Pompeo’s discussions with Moroccan officials, especially with King Mohammed, the official explained, “it struck [him] as just another Israeli leak to the press of their own issue. But it was coincident with our trip, but it wasn’t on our agenda.” The normalization reports were given credence as they appeared to originate from Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who, after meeting with Pompeo in Lisbon on December 4, told Israeli outlet Channel 12 that he hoped for an imminent and unprecedented diplomatic breakthrough with Rabat. Instead, during his visit, Pompeo focused on discussing US-Morocco trade and security cooperation. “A pleasure meeting Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita again today to reaffirm the importance of our enduring partnership, which is expanding economic opportunity and increasing security for both our countries,” he said in one of his numerous tweets about his Rabat visit.

Rabat – Moroccan taekwondo artist, Anouar Boukharsa who embarked on an undocumented migration journey less than two months ago, is set to play in the 2019 Spanish National Club’s Taekwondo competition. The event is taking place in Alicante, Spain from December 6 to December 8. On October 23, Boukharsa documented his trip in a video that went viral on social media. The taekwondo artist won several medals and participated in a number of regional, national, and international competitions representing Morocco. The most prominent title he ever won was the Arab Taekwondo Championship in 2009, in Egypt. Today, Internet users have been sharing a photo of Boukharsa’s participating card in the Spanish championship.   Boukharsa will now play under the umbrella of Spain after realizing that his future as a fighter in Morocco is uncertain.  The lack of financial and emotional support in addition to deliberate negligence from officials drove Boukharsa to migrate without documents to Spain.  Thanks to his talent, he was able to find a Spanish sports association to join to pursue his Taekwondo career. The case has triggered a wave of anger among Moroccans who argue that the Moroccan sporting system that does not provide the necessary equipment and material to develop young Morocan talents and propel them into the international arena.  Before Boukharsa, other athletes decided t to seek a better future in Europe. AS Salé and the Atlas Lions’ youth squad, Hicham Kellouch, Atlas Lioness Meriem Bouhid, OC Safi football club player Ali Hababa, petanque champion Hicham Boulassal, among other athletes all left Morocco as undocumented migrants.

Morocco is one of the US’ key allies in ensuring regional stability. Morocco “takes a leadership role in African security,” the state department added. The US state department also noted that Morocco has more than 2,000 soldiers currently deployed in UN peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. As part of the US-Morocco military collaboration, both national militaries take part in the annual African Lion training exercise, serving as an opportunity for exchanging the best practices between Morocco and the US. The statement went on to cite Morocco’s collaboration with the US Peace Corps: “Morocco is home to the oldest and largest Peace Corps program in the region, welcoming more than 5,000 Peace Corps Volunteers over the past 55 years.” “Today, almost 200 Peace Corps Volunteers work to strengthen the ties between our two nations while enhancing the life skills of Moroccan youth and encouraging volunteerism.” The statement also noted that Morocco is the only country in Africa that the US shares a Free Trade Agreement with, strengthening the economic bilateral ties between the two states.  A pleasure meeting #Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita again today to reaffirm the importance of our enduring partnership, which is expanding economic opportunity and increasing security for both our countries. pic.twitter.com/483GjQEkN5 — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) December 5, 2019

Rabat – The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, has asked the UN to recognize Jews who fled Arab and Muslim countries in the last century as refugees. The Israeli envoy announced his plans to propose a resolution about “the ‘forgotten’ Jewish refugees” to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, December 3. “We don’t hear the international community speak of them when they discuss the refugees of the conflict, perhaps because it doesn’t serve the Palestinian narrative,” said Danon, accusing the international community’s approach to refugees of being partisan. The Israeli representative did not give any details about his resolution, except that it would “acknowledge the wrong done” to the “Jewish refugees” and “make right the injustice they suffered.” During the same meeting, Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour called for humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees. He also said that the assembly’s history of resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict shows that there is no prejudice against Israel. “It doesn’t work that way,” said Mansour. The Israeli ambassador’s remarks came after the assembly approved several resolutions concerning the Israeli-Palestinian issue. One resolution includes a call for a stop to Israeli settlement of areas Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Danon said that around 850,000 Jews fled Muslim countries, including Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, and Iran, during the 20th century after enduring violence and persecution. Many left for Israel around the year 1948. The call for refugee recognition reflects Israel’s determination to put a stop to what it considers as pro-Palestinian bias at the UN. The UN assists more than 700,000 Palestinians, who fled their homes during the Six-Day War, and their descendants, established now in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. The UN created its Relief and Works Agency in 1949 to support Palestinian refugees. Israel and the US, however, accused the agency of being anti-Israel. The US reduced its funding for the agency from $360 million in 2017 to only $60 million in 2018 and then cut it off completely this year, after calling the agency “irredeemably flawed.” While Israeli leaders welcomed the US decision, Palestinians protested it. International support is “an indispensable source of hope and stability until a just solution for the Palestine refugees is realized,” said the Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo discussed means to develop trade and promote investment between the two countries on December 5, 2019.   While on an official visit to Morocco, Pompeo met with several government officials to discuss bilateral cooperation between Morocco and the US.  In a meeting with El Othmani in Rabat, Pompeo underlined the progress achieved through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). El Othmani, for his part, expressed his satisfaction with the projects planned as part of the MCC program.  The Millennium Challenge Corporation in Morocco MCC is an independent US government foreign aid agency. MCC and the Moroccan government began their partnership in 2006 to reduce poverty and unemployment in Morocco.  The first compact came into effect on September 15, 2013, focusing on fruit tree productivity, small-scale fisheries, artisan training, urban market rehabilitation, financial services, and enterprise support. Morocco and MCC spent more than $605 million to increase productivity and improve employment in these sectors. The first compact closed on September 15, 2003.  The second and current MCC-Morocco compact, signed on November 30, 2015, focuses on improving rural incomes in Morocco. The program aims to provide Moroccan farmers and their families with secure land rights and has a budget of $450 million.  The current compact supports employability and land productivity, as well as policy and institutional changes that will improve Morocco’s investment environment. In addition, the compact creates models for engagement with the private sector to address both the supply and demand sides of the labor market.  Ivanka Trump, White House adviser and daughter of US President Donald Trump, visited Morocco in early November to discuss the current MCC compact’s progress with MCC CEO Sean Cairncross, as well as to promote the White House’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity initiative.  A promising future in trade and finance In addition to lauding the MCC-Morocco collaboration, Pompeo and El Othmani expressed satisfaction with the level of bilateral cooperation between the US and Morocco.  During the meeting, the two leaders discussed means to increase strategic cooperation in the areas of trade and finance. Pompeo and El Othmani both stressed the importance of long-term US investment in Morocco’s future.  The partnership between the two countries supports Morocco’s efforts to grow its economy, increase employment, and support women’s greater participation in the workforce, according to a statement from the US State Department.  In a statement on Twitter, Pompeo shared that “the U.S. has a great friend in Morocco,” in reference to El Othmani. “We look forward to improving our trade and finance cooperation as well as strengthening our development partnership to support Morocco’s effort to grow its economy,” Pompeo’s statement continues. The meeting offered an occasion to both parties to reiterate the strength of the more than two-centuries-long friendship between the US and Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan police have been conducting raids on the homes of sub-Saharan African migrants in Rabat, in some cases detaining those with UN refugee cards, reports Spanish news outlet El Pais. A Guinean resident with a UN refugee card told the Spanish news agency that police entered his home in Rabat in the late afternoon of Monday, December 2, and rounded up 11 migrants and refugees who were inside.  The 23-year-old, named Alpha Mamoudou Balde, said that police took him and the 10 others to a police station already packed full of detained sub-Saharan Africans. “There were almost one hundred migrants detained,” Balde said. With police detaining so many people at the station, there was not enough space for everyone to remain inside with many migrants standing outside the station in the rain. Balde, who had already been living in Rabat for two years, explained that the Moroccan police released him and four of his friends about four hours later because of their UN refugee cards. “But we don’t know anything about the rest. They can take them to other southern cities or repatriate them to our country.” Spanish pressure on Morocco to control emigration While Moroccan police have frequently rounded up migrants in the north, a staging ground for attempts at irregular migration to Spain, Rabat has seen fewer raids, immigration activist Camille Denis told El Pais. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, the number of migrants arriving in Spain irregularly was far lower than the numbers crossing the Mediterranean in the east or center and arriving in Greece and Italy. Yet while the number of migrant arrivals in Greece and Italy was decreasing, more and more migrants were making the trip from Morocco to Spain successfully. In 2015, just over 5,000 migrants arrived in Spain irregularly. The figure increased to 8,000 in 2016 and jumped to 22,000 in 2017, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations. Throughout 2018, when migrant arrivals to Spain by sea more than doubled again to over 56,000, the country called for more European aid to Morocco to increase border security and prevent irregular migration. The EU eventually pledged €148 million to help Morocco control emigration in 2018. In 2019, migrant flows to Spain from Morocco have significantly decreased, with 23,000 irregular migrants arriving in Spain in the first nine months of the year. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez credited the decrease to Morocco’s tightened control on emigration.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has announced that Marrakech will host the 13th US-Africa Business Summit in June 2020. The statement came after Bourita held talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the US official’s visit to Rabat on Thursday, December 5. The summit is set to bring together more than 1,400 private sector executives, international investors, senior government officials, and decision-makers, as well as multilateral stakeholders from the US and Africa.  According to the statement, the event will serve as a platform for US and African business and government leaders to explore new business opportunities in different key sectors including agribusiness, energy, health, infrastructure, ICT, and finance, among others. Morocco is the only country in Africa to have a Free Trade Agreement with the US. Bourita also recalled that Morocco will host the “African Lion” 2020, an annual Morocco-US military training exercise.  As part of the preparations for the 2020 joint Moroccan-American military exercise, US Army Africa Commanding General (AFRICOM) Major-General Roger Cloutier met with Morocco’s major general, inspector of infantry, and commander of the South Zone, Belkheir El Farouk, on Tuesday, November 19, in the Southern Military Area Command in Agadir. The US major-general and his Moroccan colleague discussed the logistics of the upcoming 2020 “African Lion.”  The 2020 joint military exercise is “expected to be the most important in the history of combined American-Moroccan military relations,” reported Far-Maroc, a website that specializes in military news, adding that it is due to take place in March and April 2020.

Rabat – Bankia, a Spanish lending bank, has opened a new office in Morocco to support the expansion of other Spanish companies abroad.  The new office is in Casablanca, where the country’s largest international and national corporations are located. Revenue from Casablanca based businesses constitute 32% of Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP), says Investment Europe.  The managing director of Bankia’s international division, Jesus Miramon, told Investment Europe that “Bankia takes a step forward to continue backing Spanish businesses wherever they are.” He added that this explains Bankia’s “physical presence in foreign countries as the natural evolution of our foreign trade business, a strategic segment for the entity.” Bankia also stated that the opening of the new office comes in response to the growing presence of Spanish businesses in Morocco. Bankia aims to increase the investment plans of Spanish enterprises outside of their national boundaries.  Bankia is the fourth largest financial entity in Spain with over 8 million customers, according to the Madrid Stock Exchange.  During the first quarter of 2019, Spain was Morocco’s highest trade market with imported and exported products totaling almost €4 billion, according to the European Union statistics office. Morocco’s exports to Spain increased to €1.8 billion, while Morocco’s imports from Spain decreased to €2.09 billion.  Miramon concluded that he would like Bankia to extend the presence of Spanish businesses internationally and achieve higher trade volume. In doing so, “Morocco is a key market.”

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that police have responded to 384 cybercrime cases so far in 2019. The majority of the crimes are online scams and sexual blackmail. A large number of the crimes targeted foreigners living outside of Morocco, according to the same source. DGSN presented the number during a study day on “sextortion,” organized in the Royal Institute of Police in Kenitra on Thursday, December 5. “A number of crimes via internet are transborder,” explains DGSN. The Moroccan authority transferred 61 of the recorded cases to the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol. It also transferred nine other cross-border cases to Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to treat them diplomatically. DGSN noted that the number of transborder cases has increased over the last year. The number of cybercrimes concerning exclusively Moroccan parties was 252, with the majority of cases relating to blackmail of a sexual nature. In 2018, Moroccan police recorded 407 cases of cybercrime. Morocco’s penal code punishes several types of cybercrime, however, “when the legal text is not enough to formulate a sentence, Moroccan judges can resort to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime,” explains Mohamed El Khadraoui, a member of Morocco’s Higher Council of Judicial Power (CSPJ). Morocco was the first non-European country to sign the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. The international treaty, signed in 2001, seeks to address internet and computer crimes by harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques, and increasing cooperation among nations.

Rabat – The Judicial Center of the Royal Gendarmerie has issued a national search warrant for a man who drove over an official from the Ministry of Interior in Foum Jemaa town in the province of Azilal in central Morocco.  The official, a “caid” or interior ministry agent who holds a rank just below governor, was run over on Friday, December 6.  According to the initial investigation, the Royal Gendarmerie identified the suspect as an Algerian national. After searching the suspect’s home, authorities seized his passport. The entire incident was documented in a video and is circulating on social media. The Algerian national was protesting against the opening of a road on his land; the caid then followed him to his car and asked him to wait for the gendarmes to arrive.  The driver did not comply with the caid’s request and drove over him. The driver proceeded to drag the caid for several meters as witnesses, including auxiliary forces, looked on. The Algerian national then fled the scene. The caid suffered a fracture to the hip and was rushed to the hospital center in Beni Mellal before being transferred to a private clinic at the request of the head of the internal affairs department in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra.

Rabat – French Montana’s new album “Montana” dropped on December 5, and the rapper used artwork and lyrics to pay yet another tribute to his heritage. The 35-year-old, whose real name is Karim Kkarbouch, grew up in Casablanca before emigrating to New York at the age of 13.  After a brief stint in a Los Angeles hospital last week, French Montana released his greatly anticipated new music. “Montana” contains previously-released tracks such as “Wiggle It” and “No Stylist” along with an array of new songs.   The Moroccan-American rapper caused a stir in late September when he first teased the “Montana” album artwork, showing the artist surrounded by women in black burqas and red thigh-high boots.  Some social media users dubbed the cover “haram” or disrespectful to Islam for the choice to “sexualize niqabis,” describing women who wear niqabs. One Instagram user called it “deeply offensive.” French Montana has now released more artwork for the official release of the album. New photos show the Moroccan-American rapper in a blue and red patterned robe, a pair of light blue trousers with gold trim, red velvet loafers, and a red scarf tied around his head.  In a headshot, the rapper’s “pray” neck tattoo is in full view, along with glittering chains and a mouth of gold-plated teeth.  Another image places a woman with a red, sequined hijab alongside the rapper’s headshot.     A post shared by POWER 106 (@power_106) on Dec 5, 2019 at 11:05pm PST The album contains a new song titled “Salam Alaykum,” and the track features the Arabic phrases “wallahi” (I swear to God) and “assalamu ʿalaykum” (peace be upon you).  Like several of his previously-released songs, “Salam Alaykum” directly references Morocco with the lyrics “Yeah, sit Moroccan couches/Fountain of youth crib like Mott Haven housin’.” Another song on the album, “Say Goodbye,” references when the rapper moved from Morocco to the US with his family: “Ayy, Al Pacino his first screen/Young Morocco he was 13.” Throughout his career, French Montana has always expressed pride in his North African and Arab roots.  He performed at Morocco’s 2018 Mawazine music festival before a crowd of 100,000 Moroccan concert-goers. Before finishing the show, the singer, songwriter, and producer expressed his love and devotion to God, his country, and the king. He then thanked the Moroccan public, whom he esteemed to be the “best crowd” he had seen in a long time. After performing at Mawazine, the artist conducted a press conference in Arabic. Montana specifically cited “feel[ing] like being part of the Arabic success,” adding that Arab rappers account for “only a small community” in the global hip-hop forum.  “I just loved being a Moroccan guy who left his home at 13 to make the best music possible,” said Montana.

Rabat – Thanks to Morocco’s 20% tax rebate on foreign films the number of foreign movies and television series shot in Morocco continues to rise. According to the Moroccan Cinema Center (CCM), the total foreign production spending in Morocco grew from $32 million in 2017 to $50 million in 2018. As of November 2019, foreign production spending stands at $80 million.  The rebate, managed by the CCM, came into effect in 2017 with the aim of attracting foreign television and film shoots to Moroccan studios.  The measure essentially grants foreign investors a 20% refund on certain expenses, provided that they invest at least $1 million into production and that the shoot takes place over a period of at least 18 days.  The rebate has a fixed annual budget of around $11 million. Refunds are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.  To qualify for the reimbursement, investors must present proof of eligible expenses. Such expenses include local talent, crew hotel bills, airline tickets, studios, equipment rental, transport, fuel, and aerial shooting.    Khadija Alami, CEO of K Films, is one producer who has benefitted from the rebate. She reports a rising number of shoots in her studio, Oasis Studios Morocco.  Located in Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara desert, Oasis Studios Morocco specifically targets foreign productions. The studio has hosted more than 50 international productions, including “Homeland,” “Prison Break,” “Captain Phillips,” “Blindspot,” “Deep State,” “Baghdad Central,” “Ray James,” and “Aquaman.” In an interview with Variety, Alami said that she wants the CCM to propose improvements to the rebate scheme in order to make it more competitive. She also wants more funds put towards Moroccan national production: At present, support for national production hovers around only $6.24 million.  Alami would like to see a mechanism that channels money from foreign shoots into national production, Variety reported.  Karim Debbagh, CEO of Kasbah Films, already has three major international productions lined up for 2020. According to Variety, the Tangier-based production services company will have a key role in “Cherry” with Tom Holland, “The Forgiven” with Ralph Fiennes, and South Korea’s “Kidnapped.” Speaking to Variety, Debbagh said the tax rebate has encouraged producers to extend shoot durations and increase expenses made in the country, he added.  Kasbah Films was the first production company to benefit from the tax rebate, with “Mosul,” a documentary thriller about the battle to reclaim the Iraqi city from ISIS. Kasbah Films has also hosted “Men in Black: International” and “The Last Planet,” a spiritual film about the Bible.  Debbagh is expecting to see the volume of foreign productions in Morocco triple in 2020.

Rabat – A fire broke out at noon on Friday, December 6, in Arribat Center, a recently-opened shopping mall in Morocco’s capital, killing a security guard, according to a witness. The fire trapped the victim in the mall’s basement, where he passed away. The smoke also caused several faintings among visitors of the mall. Videos circulating online show black smoke coming out of one of the mall’s entrances and local authorities arriving at the scene to keep pedestrians away from the fire.  Firefighters arrived at the scene five minutes after the fire started.  A witness told Morocco World News that sounds of electrical sparks came from the parking garage below the mall before smoke started rising. A circuit breaker failure caused the fire, the witness said. At first, people thought the loud sounds they heard were “a bombardment.” Arribat Center, located in the district of Agdal, is the second largest mall in Morocco, after Casablanca’s Morocco Mall. The shopping center opened two weeks ago, on November 20. The shopping mall boasts more than 216,000 square meters and cost MAD 2.4 billion to build. It offers a range of facilities to visitors, including stores, offices, a hotel, a conference center, a multi screen cinema, an urban park, and a parking garage. Arribat Center aims to attract around 10 million visitors per year. It also opened up 7,000 new job opportunities.

Rabat – After days of heavy rainfall throughout Morocco, the Ouzoud Falls are bursting their banks. The popular tourist site in the Middle Atlas village of Tanaghmeilt, 150 kilometers northeast of Marrakech, experienced fierce flooding on Thursday, December 5.   Video footage from the site shows massive torrents of muddy water flowing at a rapid pace over the edge of the cascade. Structures near the waterfall’s crest appear to have sustained damage from the flooding. While flooding in this region is not particularly common, this is not the first time Ouzoud Falls have overflowed. In November 2014, a wave of unprecedented heavy rainfall affected many regions of southern Morocco. The weather wreaked havoc on Tanaghmeilt and its famous cascades, where tourists often enjoy boat tours.

Rabat – Police seized 5 tons and 70 kilograms of cannabis resin in Morocco’s northeastern city of Nador on Thursday morning, December 5. According to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), judicial police found the drugs in a commercial vehicle on the “rocade” highway on the outskirts of Nador. The driver of the vehicle fled, and police are working to “identify and arrest” the individual, Maghreb Arab Press reports. Police found the cannabis resin wrapped in 169 large packages in the vehicle. DGSN frequently announces large drug seizures of cannabis resin, as well as cocaine and psychotropic pills. Only the day before the Nador bust, Wednesday, December 4, the DGSN announced it had seized 1,138 kilograms of cannabis resin in Errachidia, a city in eastern Morocco. The DGSN released statistics on its arrests and seizures related to drugs from January to September 2019, reporting that police seized 112 tons of cannabis and its derivatives and made over 400,000 drug trafficking arrests.

Rabat – A few tense moments, a couple terse remarks, but family is family and the alliance has generally earned the title of the most successful military alliance to date. Just prior to Wednesday’s NATO executive meeting of the 29-member security alliance an exasperated French President Emmanuel Macron declared that the organization was experiencing “brain death” due to a lack of coherent strategic goals. U.S. President Donald Trump responded by calling Macron’s diagnosis “very nasty”. It’s likely, though, that Macron’s comments served as a valuable pressure release valve for several alliance leaders, breaking the ice so that criticisms (real and imagined) could be voiced amidst tension that had been building since last year’s rocky summit in Brussels.  And like a good therapist, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg guided Trump, Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and others toward mutually agreed upon goals: importantly, the alliance will begin a multi-year rethink of key strategic priorities and doctrine. That self-reflection is likely to emphasize both organizational agility (a Trump priority), the ability to respond to new developing threats like transnational terrorism, regional instability outside NATO, nuclear proliferation and cyber warfare, as well as core values that were forged decades ago like protecting the stability and prosperity of NATO’s eastern flank against a resurgent Russian foreign policy. A common Trump complaint since becoming president has been military spending burden-sharing among individual alliance members. A NATO status report released this spring noted that just six European allies have met the 2% national defense spending (percentage of national GDP) threshold sought by Trump: Estonia, Greece, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and the UK. Two more members—Bulgaria and Romania—will meet the threshold with current spending projections for 2019. It’s worth noting that in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO members pledged to spend 2% or more of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. The subject is not new and U.S. leaders have raised the issue for decades. NATO has proved its operational effectiveness, from the Balkans in the 1990s to post-9/11 Afghanistan security assistance collaboration. Numerous challenges remain, from Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles to the demise of the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. But amidst the recent tension, the European security umbrella still works—70 years later. Beyond Trump’s sometimes abrasive tone, the issues that he has raised represent a much-needed reimagining of key definitions: conflict, collective defense, and security. The wisdom of John Foster Dulles, the American Secretary of State during the 1950s, finds meaning in NATO’s current stretch of turbulence: “The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year.” While NATO reexamines its core principles, the planet is heating up, rapidly. A new estimate of total global carbon emissions conducted by the Global Carbon Project reveals a grime reality: Global carbon (fossil fuel) emissions are likely to reach an all-time high in 2019. The rates of emissions may be slowing in 2019 compared to the previous year, but global economic growth requires fuel sources that renewable energy sources cannot alone meet. Officials and activists from 200 countries are in Madrid this week for the COP25 climate change conference. COP (Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change) is tasked with monitoring global progress on the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The conference meets amid more troubling data. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released its annual state of the global climate report. The 2010-2019 decade will almost certainly be the hottest decade on record. More heat, more extreme weather, rising sea levels, retreating glaciers, more threats to coastal and low-lying areas of the globe. Weather phenomenon combining with climate change to create a perfect storm of ecological degradation, human suffering and dislocation as well as economic resource degradation. Climate research continues on the most complex phenomenon like rising sea levels and melting permafrost areas, the former likely to endanger coastal areas (and coastal maritime economies) while the latter phenomenon could result in significant amounts of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere that had long remained frozen underground. The 2015 Paris climate agreement called upon countries to take steps to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius this century, while advocating for a more ambitious 1.5-degree limit. Since the mid-1800s when industrialization began to spread across Europe, the planet has now warmed by about 1.1 degrees Celsius, according to the WMO. The UN Environment Programme believes global CO2 emissions would have to fall by at least 25% over the coming decade or two for either of those two goals to remain obtainable. Pessimism abounds for reaching either goal and implementing a carbon trading (carbon markets) mechanism is even more contentious. Leadership on the climate change issue can and must come from a multitude of sectors—government, academic, corporate, and even military. In the US, military leadership and defense department planners outlined the threats of climate change in a landmark July 2015 report to Congress. Climate changes can and might aggravate regional instability, political conflicts, poverty and natural resource allocation conflicts, the report said. The past month has demonstrated the American partisan split on the climate issue. While the Trump administration submitted paperwork in November to formally withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi led a Congressional delegation to the Madrid COP gathering now underway. The threats that the global community faces are numerous. Sometimes a strong military and a robust military alliance is the ultimate guarantor of peace and tranquility. Sometimes collaborative action is required for the common defense against global threats that—in the words of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres—have brought the planet to “the point of no return.” The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

London – Spanning decades prior, the “Peace Process” has come to define an idea of failed Western intervention in the tumult between Israel and its neighbors, and how long-disputed lands and natural resources might be split in a way agreeable for all parties. The next notable milestone on the timeline will be the so-called “Deal of the Century”; upcoming talks spurred by President Donald Trump, who is eager to put his name on a list of politicians who have endeavored to pull the proverbial sword from the stone. However, few have considered what the proposed deal means for Jordan. If implemented, Jordan may be disturbed enough by the fact that the fragile fabric of its society, and indeed its monarchy, may collapse. This would inevitably create lasting ripples elsewhere in the region. For the future of the country, Jordanians and other Middle Eastern residents await the deal’s terms with bated breath, and a justified dose of skepticism. According to Dr. Herman Schmidt of the London-based Global Distribution Network, “The Middle East Peace Process is as myopic as it is ineffective, leaders must start viewing the conflict as a broader regional issue. Indeed the implications of any peace agreement will stretch far beyond the borders of the Levant.” The timeline of Jordan as a sovereign nation is uneven, with the country changing hands several times. Jordan, as it exists now, was formed with the support of the British post-World War II, which allocated the then-territory of Transjordan to King Abdullah I as part of the British Mandate. At the same time, the area West of the Jordan River was made the State of Israel, while Syria endured its own reformation under the French. These changing borders, and also the wars against Israel in 1948 and 1967, ensured that Jordan’s population of Palestinian refugees grew into the millions. Though an accurate census hasn’t been taken to confirm, Jordan is overwhelmingly Palestinian, with estimates putting the population at up to 70%. Official numbers from UNRWA state that it’s only 18%, but these figures are skewed and obfuscated by the monarchy’s numbers, which rely on inaccurate census data as a security measure to ensure the country appears, on paper, to be majority Jordanian. Jordanian-Palestinians are purposely denied representation and citizenship – allowing the Kingdom to continue to deny voting rights and a sense of inclusivity in Jordanian society to Palestinians. The fragile concept of Jordanian identity will be front of mind for the King of Jordan during Trump’s “Deal of the Century” talks. We know little about what the deal contains, but some of the details that are known indicate social upheaval is a likely result. Allegedly leaked specifics include economic and structural development for Gaza and the West Bank, and perhaps a division of Jerusalem along ethnic lines, but these are not confirmed. What we do know for certain is that Jordan will again be responsible for administering and absorbing much of the area’s Palestinian residents. If Jordan is forced to give citizenship to Palestinian refugees and absorb more of them, it will likely push back at the deal. For the King, rapid demographic change threatens to dilute the power of Jordanians, and thus his own monarchy, at the expense of Palestinians. This is why he and his administration pretend to support a two-state solution while at the same time suppress Palestinian rights and representation. This idea is economic as much as it is sociological, with Jordan also struggling to maintain its fragile economy amid volatile geopolitical tensions. Looming economic problems for Jordan and their rapid unraveling in the wake of a potential peace deal should not be a primary consideration when negotiations commence, but they’re hard to ignore. Jordan has absorbed 1.3 million Syrian refugees after the crisis on its northern border, which strains an already weak economy. Its debt-to-GDP is an astounding 94.23%—kept afloat by IMF loans, aid from Saudi Arabia and the US, and a slew of very unpopular austerity measures like a higher income tax and the removal of key subsidies. To avoid financial unrest that may topple his Kingdom, King Abdullah is playing along with the peace process for now but may flip the board if it risks his country’s economy and his grip on power. Abdullah’s recent crackdown on his people illustrates this notion well and proves Jordan isn’t ready for the type of significant geosocial changes that may take place. Dozens of activists, writers, journalists, and other critics have been detained in 2019, as economic and political stresses increasingly impact the average Jordanian citizen. Increasingly worrisome attempts at maintaining control give a stark preview of what would happen if the peace process exposes the delicate balance currently maintained. If Jordan is required to absorb more Palestinians or take control of the Palestinian territories, the country will cease to exist in its current form. The intertwining nature of politics in the Middle East means that an Israeli-Palestinian concord needs to consider its bearing on neighboring countries and whether peace in one place creates disquiet in others. Few will deny that the “Deal of the Century” will affect Jordanian identity and sovereignty, but measures must be taken  to ensure Israeli-Palestinian agreements do not disrupt the already delicate Jordanian-Palestinian status quo.

Rabat – Despite reports that Mike Pompeo’s much-anticipated visit to Morocco would mostly feature prospective normalization between Morocco and Israel, the US State Department’s statement about the visit makes no mention of diplomatic normalization between the two countries. Pompeo flew to Rabat on December 5, to meet with several senior officials as part of what has largely been described as Rabat and Washington’s “shared desire” to broaden diplomatic relations. Pompeo’s visit comes to strengthen the “value” of the US-Morocco partnership and the  importance of cooperation between the two countries in different fields, security and trade in particular, the statement said. Prior to his visit, Pompeo described Morocco as “one of the strongest” US allies in the region. He particularly highlighted Morocco’s lauded counterterrorism intelligence and operations. This aspect of the US-Morocco cooperation was the most notable in the State Department’s statement of Pompeo’s visit.  The statement described how the US supports Morocco’s efforts to instill peace in the region to counter “the Iranian regime’s malign activities.” Morocco is among the countries that have shared concerns about Iran and its  activities to interfere in domestic affairs, with the kingdom severing ties with Iran in May 2018. Rabat accused Tehran of collaborating with the Polisario Front through its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Also included in the statement was the historical significance of the Morocco-US alliance. The statement suggested that Morocco played a particular role in US history as it was the first country to recognize the US shortly after its independence in 1777. Morocco established official diplomatic relations with the US the same year. “That same year, Morocco opened its ports to the ships of the new American republic, allowing us to engage in trade and commerce and supporting our fight for freedom. Our friendship has endured,” the statement explained. Concerns about normalization Moroccan activists continue to express concerns about any potential normalization with Israel. The concerns are in line the Moroccan state’s longterm solidarity for the Palestinian cause. Reacting to Pompeo’s visit earlier today, , the Moroccan Observatory against Normalization said: “[The]visit of American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Rabat … angered the anti-normalization [activists].The zionist entity is an enemy for Moroccan people and for Morocco.” The observatory also warned that “whoever wants or tried to plunge Morocco into the quagmire of normalization in the state or society he is just an obedient servant, an obedientt servant of the Zionist circles and its terrorist entity.” In more measured language, the Moroccan government has also repeatedly repelled any suggestions of normalization with Israel. The country continues to openly affirm its support fo the Palestinian case and defend the legitimate rights of Palestinian people. This is not the first time that anti-normalization activists have shared fears over US official visits. Similar concerns were also shared during the visit of senior official Jared Kushner earlier this year. Morocco remains partner to tackle security issues The statement from the US Department also spoke about Morocco’s leadership in security and its contribution to peace in Africa, with more than 2,000 Moroccan soldiers active in UN peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. Morocco “plays a key role in expanding regional security capabilities,” the statement said. The press release indicated that the North African country is also a vital ally in “the Administration’s campaign to promote regional security and will host the Warsaw Process Counterterrorism Working Group” in February 2020. In addition to its counterterrorism approach, Morocco’s efforts to promote coexistence and tolerance are also much lauded in the international community. “Morocco is a recognized regional leader in promoting religious co-existence and interfaith dialogue,” the US department of state has  concluded.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has described  Mike Pompeo’s visit to Morocco as “unique,” saying it came at a time when both the US and Morocco understand the significance of their alliance as well as the need to further consolidate their cooperation.   Bourita, speaking after his meeting with the US Secretary of State, underlined the importance of the visit, explaining that it is the first of its kind for Pompeo to the region and in Morocco in his capacity as a US Secretary of State. “The visit of the Secretary of State comes as a renewal of the strength of the strategic relations between Morocco and the United States,” Bourita said. The Moroccan official emphasized that the desire of  US to strengthen its relations with Morocco “constitutes a recognition of the stability, credibility and reforms characteristic of Morocco.” The statement from the FM also covered the US-Morocco trade cooperation, stipulating that Rabat and Washington have been able to achieve “close economic cooperation.” Bourita said that the volume of trade exchanges exceeded the threshold of MAD 51 billion dirhams, representing an increase of 28% compared to 2017. “The United States is the third importer of Moroccan goods and it is the  fourth supplier to Morocco,” the statement said.  US investments come in the seventh place among Morocco’s direct foreign investments. The US has long reiterated the importance of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The US State of Departement said that in 2006, “Morocco entered into a free-trade agreement (FTA) with the United States. Since its entry into force, Moroccan exports to the United States have more than doubled, and U.S.” About 160 American companies are operational in Morocco. In addition to trade, Bourita also drew attention to the significant number of US tourists who visited Morocco in 2019. “More than 300,000 American tourists visited Morocco this year, an increase of 20 percent compared to 2017,” said the Moroccan foreign minister. The visit also served as an opportunity to discuss and exchange views on a number of international and regional issues of common concern, including the situation in Sahel. “As Morocco considers that unilateral approaches have proven ineffective, it calls for a comprehensive and collective approach based on coordination between the countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, the Sahel states (CEN-SAD) and West Africa (CEDEAO),” the statement added. Bourita warned that security challenges in the Sahel remain  linked to the growing phenomenon of terrorism and organized crime. The situation threatens stability and development in the entire region, according to the minister. Subsequently, the Moroccan minister said that Rabat and Washington discussed avenues to continued cooperation in maintaining  regional stability and “defeating terrorist groups and jihadist organizations.”

Rabat – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not follow the published agenda for his Morocco visit, leaving the country earlier than planned. With his early departure, the US secretary of state missed a previously scheduled meeting with King Mohammed VI and a dinner at the royal palace in Rabat. Pompeo arrived in Rabat today, December 5, to boost the cooperation between Rabat and Washington through meeting several Moroccan officials. US Secretary of State’s website published the agenda yesterday, December 4. The initial schedule included a meeting with King Mohammed VI on Pompeo’s arrival. It also included a dinner at the royal palace. The website, however, updated the plan today and reduced the visit to only three meetings. It is unclear why the meeting with the monarch and the dinner were cancelled. A press conference scheduled after Pompeo’s meeting with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita was also cancelled for undisclosed reasons. The Moroccan Foreign Minister and David Green, Charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Rabat, received Secretary Pompeo at the Rabat-Sale International Airport. The American official then held meetings with Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bourita, and the Minister of State, Mustapha Ramid. Finally, Secretary Pompeo held security talks with the Head of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) Abdellatif Hammouchi at the DGSN headquarters near Rabat. Pompeo departed shortly after wrapping up his meetings. The official visit is the latest in several exchanges between Moroccan and American officials aiming to develop partnerships between the two countries. Ahead of his visit, Pompeo referred to Morocco as one of the US “strongest partners.” The two countries collaborate in a number of fields, most notably in the fight against extremism and global terror threats. Relations between Morocco and the US are more than two centuries old. Morocco was the first country to grant diplomatic recognition to the US, back in 1777. Morocco is also the only African country with which the US has a Free Trade Agreement. The value of trade between the two countries quintupled since the signing of the agreement in 2006. The US considers Morocco as an important partner on a range of security issues. The two countries participate jointly in more than 100 military engagements and annual training exercises.

The NGO supports and encourages women working in nuclear industries around the world.  With 35,000 members from 109 countries, WiN is composed of women working professionally in medicine and health care, in regulatory authorities, in industry, and as independent researchers.  The NGO aims to promote the understanding and public awareness of the benefits of nuclear and radiation technologies, while addressing public concerns regarding such technologies. WiN strives to foster interest in nuclear engineering and science among women and youth.  With an office in Kenitra, local women working in the field will be able to discuss nuclear issues and exchange ideas, information, and experience. The Kenitra chapter also strives to offer young Moroccan women tools to succeed in their studies and professional life.  Senior officials from Kenitra’s Ibn Tofail University presided over the chapter’s inauguration on Monday, along with officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The inauguration took place after a two-day conference that promoted cooperation between African women working in the nuclear sector.

Rabat – Youssef Amrani, Morocco’s ambassador to Botswana, presented his credentials to Botswanan president Mokgweetsi Maisisi on Thursday, December 4. Amrani shared Morocco’s wish to strengthen political dialogue with Botswana and to develop bilateral economic ties through cooperation.  While meeting with the president, Amrani passed on King Mohammed VI’s hopes for progress and prosperity in Botswana and the best wishes of the Moroccan people. The Botswanan president responded in kind, sharing his respect for Kind Mohammed and praising his role in promoting south-south cooperation within the African Union. The AU is a point of shared interest for the two countries, with both nations hoping to further continental cooperation and dialogue. In August 2019, president Maisisi accepted the credentials of Malainin Mohamed Lakhala, an “ambassador” from the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The south African country officially recognizes the self-styled republic’s claims to Western Sahara, a point of contention with Morocco who views the region as part of its own sovereign territory.  However, Botswana and Morocco have maintained strong diplomatic relations since 2005, despite the hostile move from Botswana.

Rabat – General Director of  Morocco’s National Security (DGSN)  Abdellatif Hammouchi received the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, December 5.  Several top security officials from both the US and the DGSN attended the meeting chaired jointly by Pompeo and Hammouchi. Morocco and the US share regular security cooperation to face several challenging crises in the region, including the scourge of terrorism. The US State Department has remarked on Morocco’s leadership in security in annual reports throughout the years. In its latest Country Report on Terrorism, the US Departement of State reiterated that Morocco has a comprehensive approach to combatting terrorism. The report also spoke about the “excellent and long-standing” counterterrorism cooperation between the US and Morocco and cited the effectiveness of Morocco’s security unit, the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), and its role to combat terrorism. The document also noted the BCIJ’s efforts in dismantling a significant number of ISIS-linked terror cells. Pompeo arrived in Morocco today to hold meetings with senior Moroccan officials including Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Pompeo’s visit to Morocco comes just weeks after his meeting with Bourita in October. The meeting was part of the US-Morocco Strategic Dialogue, convincing top officials from both countries to exchange views on regional issues and to vow to reinforce diplomatic relations. In a joint press release following the meeting,  Pompeo spoke about Morocco’s “precious” support for the causes of peace, security, and development. The US and Morocco launched the Strategic Dialogue for the first time on September 13, 2012.

Rabat – The President of the Prosecutor General’s Office, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, has called on Morocco’s Public Prosecution to adopt a rigorous approach in the application of legal provisions on the exploitation of children. Abdennabaoui encouraged Moroccan judges to actively engage in eliminating the exploitation of children in begging. Speaking at the launch of the Action Plan for the Protection of Children from Exploitation in Begging on Wednesday, December 5, the prosecutor urged judges to put the children’s best interests first by seeking appropriate solutions to protect them.  The judiciary will carry out the child protection operation in coordination with all child-protection institutions, families, and civil society, specified the prosecutor. Abdennababoui believes that the prosecution judiciary can play a significant role in protecting children who are victims of acts that the law criminalizes. “The judicial protection for children is just one of the forms of protection that children need,” he said.  He went on to add that children’s best interests are one of the main objectives of the national policy that Morocco has undertaken under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The phenomenon of begging is growing in Morocco. In recent years, there has been an increase in the exploitation of children in begging. Begging varies from selling tissue boxes and wiping cars’ windows in exchange for some coins, to circulating from a cafe to another asking for money. In July 2019, the prefectural police department of Agadir decided to launch DNA tests for professional beggars to verify their relationship with the children accompanying them.  The initiative came after the discovery of several networks specialized in exploiting children and infants for begging.  Police caught one such network  April 20, after passersby caught a man and a woman who were about to abduct a child in front of a kindergarten in Taddart, in the commune of Anza in Agadir. After the failure of the abduction attempt, the woman told investigating police that she and her accomplices lure the children with treats before taking them in a car to a female beggar who lives in Izeggane, Ait Melloul (15 kilometers south of Agadir).  The woman then sends the children out onto the streets to beg, taking their earnings for herself.

Rabat – Moroccan international football players Hakim Ziyech and Achraf Hakimi are both on the shortlist of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Awards 2019. Ziyech is nominated for the African Player of the Year award, while Hakimi is defending his title as Best African Youth Player. 🇨🇲🇲🇦🇩🇿🇸🇳🇪🇬
🇳🇬🇬🇦🇩🇿🇸🇳🇩🇿 🆕 Cover photo updated 🆕 pic.twitter.com/phgm936NWI — CAF (@CAF_Online) December 5, 2019  CAF posted the shortlists on their website after the confederation’s technical and development committee had completed the voting phase on Wednesday, December 4. 3⃣0⃣ ➡ 1⃣0⃣ The list of Africa’s elite now has 10 names 🌎🔝 Who’ll be crowned African Player of the Year? 🏆 #CAFAwards2019 pic.twitter.com/qqrhq25vMN — CAF (@CAF_Online) December 4, 2019  Ziyech, currently playing for Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, has been consistent in his performance both in the local league and the continental Champions League. In the 2018-2019 season, Ziyech scored 21 goals and made 18 assists over 48 games with Ajax. He also led his team to the Champions League semi-final after eliminating some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Real Madrid and Juventus. Ziyech is giving impressive performances in the current season as well. The African player of the year nominee has already scored 8 goals and gave 11 assists in only 25 games. With the Atlas Lions, however, Ziyech’s performance has been less than remarkable. In the recent African Cup of Nations (CAN 2019), Moroccan fans were counting on the 26-year-old player to lead the national squad to glory. However, not only was Ziyech in a subpar form, but he also missed a penalty in the last minute of the round-of-16 game against Benin, leading to the Atlas Lions’ elimination. It remains to be seen if Ziyech’s performance with his club will be enough to compensate for his failure with the national team and earn him the title of best African player. – Achraf Hakimi 🇲🇦
– Krépin Diatta 🇸🇳
– Moussa Djenepo🇲🇱
– Samuel Chukwueze 🇳🇬
– Victor Osimhen 🇳🇬 The updated shortlist for Youth Player of the Year is not shy of talent! #CAFAwards2019 pic.twitter.com/1yg1pCcxZf — CAF (@CAF_Online) December 4, 2019  Hakimi, on the other hand, continues to give great performances both with his German club Borussia Dortmund and with the Atlas Lions. The 21-year-old player is one of the best defenders and wingers in the German league. On top of his versatility as a player— he can play both attacking and defending roles on both sides— Hakimi is able to keep performing at the same level throughout entire fast-paced games. Hakimi is one of the top scorers of the ongoing Champions League, scoring four goals in only five games. He also scored one goal in the most recent Atlas Lions match. The game against Burundi for the CAN 2021 qualifiers ended with a 3-0 score. While Hakimi is a strong candidate for the Best Youth Player Award, Ziyech is facing strong competition for the Best African Player Award. The list includes Ismail Bennacer, Riyad Mahrez, and Youcef Belaili who won the 2019 CAN with Algeria, as well as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane who won the European Champions League last season with Liverpool. In 2018, Egypt’s Mohamed Salah won the African Player of the Year Award, while Achraf Hakimi won the title of Youth Player of the Year. Herve Renard, Atlas Lions’ coach at the time, and Fouzi Lekjaa, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) also won awards last year. Renard received the Men’s Coach of the Year, while Lekjaa earned the title of Federation President of the Year.

Rabat – The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forestry, Aziz Akhannouch, has said that the olive sector covered19% of Morocco’s domestic edible oil use and generated an annual average of MAD 1.8 billion (approximately $180 million) from exports for the period 2013-2017. Akhannouch was speaking at the opening of the 6th National Olive Forum in the city of El Attaouiya, Sraghna province, southeastern Morocco. The Forum started on Wednesday, December 4 and ends on Saturday, December 7. The minister noted that the olive trees represent 65% of the national arboreal sole and remain the most produced fruit in Morocco. The sector is an important source of employment, providing more than 51 million workdays annually, equivalent to 380,000 permanent jobs, he added. According to the minister, the achievements reflect the positive impact of the strategic choices set out in Morocco’s Green Plan for the development of the olive oil sector in Morocco.  Akhannouch also highlighted the approach adopted by the sector’s professionals who have worked with the state to establish value chain integration. Value chain integration is the process by which olive enterprises collaboratively implement, plan, and manage the flow of goods, services, and information from point of origin to point of consumption. It aims to increase value from a customer perspective and optimizes the efficiency of the chain. The Moroccan state developed a program for the olive oil industry for the period 2009-2020. The program involves developing the production and quality of olives, maintaining the value and price of the olives, and improving the sector’s framework conditions in terms of creating new businesses. The Moroccan government is committed to supporting the sector’s professionals in exporting their goods by handing out grants for the 2017-2021 period. Morocco’s revenues from exporting olives and olive oil remain much lower than Tunisia, whose earnings from olive oil exports are close to half a billion dollars a year.

Rabat – Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred announced his return to the stage in late November, but his upcoming concert in Saudi Arabia’s capital city, scheduled for December 18, has not been well received by all of the kingdom’s citizens.      سعيد أحبائي بعودتي قريبا للخشبة , سأوافيكم قريبا ان شاء الله بالتواريخ . #الله_ينصر_سيدنا #BACK_ON_STAGE_SOON #saadlamjarred1 #love_my_fans_forever_and_ever #love_my_parents_forever_and_ @nabs_bounira A post shared by  saadlamjarred (@saadlamjarred1) on Nov 22, 2019 at 12:38pm PST The hashtag “we do not want Saad Lamjarred in Riyadh” began trending on Twitter after Saudi Arabia’s Chairman of General Authority for Entertainment Turki Al Sheikh shared the promotional poster for the music festival ‘Mawssim Riyadh.’ Other performers at Mawssim Riyadh include Lebanese singer Myriam Fares and a Kuwaiti singing group named “Firqat Mayami,” or Miami Band in English.  Some Saudi Twitter users expressed their disgust with the Moroccan pop star’s history of sexual assault. Lamjarred has a long history of rape allegations dating back to 2010, with the star serving prison time in France in 2017 and 2018. After completing his sentences, he was unable to leave France until August 2019. ثلاثتهم يبدون بحرف الميم 😍 ميامي

In early November, Youtube removed the music video of his song “Ensay” (Forget) due to copyright infringement. In October, Youtube removed his music video “Salam” after Moroccan artist Hicham Telmoudi accused Lamjarred of plagiarism. A month prior, Lebanese singer Joe Raad claimed that Lamjarred copied his style in the music video for “Lmaallem.” Despite Lamjarred’s high-profile convictions and controversies, he remains a prominent figure in the Arabic-speaking world.

Rabat – The research and study center at the Mohammadia League of Scholars, “Rabita Mohammadia of Ulema,” is organizing the second conference on “the role of religious institutions in reinforcing the ability of youth to prevent extremism.” The two-day conference is set to take place at the institution’s headquarters in Rabat, starting on Friday, December 6. The event is a collaboration between the league of scholars and the UN office in Rabat. The event aims to open up a dialogue between governmental institutions, civil society, UN organizations, and religious bodies. Experts from various fields and from several Arab and African countries will attend the conference. The participants will share their experiences in preventing extremism in its different forms. The conference’s different sessions aim to propose plans and programs to reinforce the role of religious institutions in building a positive religious dialogue, based on respecting human rights. The organizers explain that the conference also aims to present explanations of religious texts that emphasize the value of safety, security, and tolerance. Participants expect the event to result in practical strategies for national and regional religious institutions that will strengthen the role of women and youth in preventing extremism. The conference is also expected to launch a committee to supervise the implementation of the strategies and their results. The event will include a number of activities, including seminars, storytelling, and workshops. King Mohammed VI founded the Mohammadia League of Scholars in February 2006. The organization’s main goals are defining and promoting the values of moderate Islam, organizing scientific and cultural events on Islamic studies, and ensuring collaboration between scholars, intellectuals, and cultural and religious organizations both in Morocco and in the region. The league of scholars is one of many institutions that bring international recognition to Morocco’s counterterrorism efforts. In November 2019, the US State Department’s 2018 Country Report on Terrorism praised Morocco’s efficient handling of terrorist threats. Morocco is an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The kingdom is also a member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and is currently its co-chair with the Netherlands. Regionally, Morocco is a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council and an active member of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership. Morocco is also a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force that aims to prevent the financing of terrorist organizations.

Rabat – With US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expected today in Rabat, reports are ripe that the visit will essentially revolve around talks of prospective normalization between Morocco and Israel. Several Israeli news outlets, including the Times of Israel, have pointed to the marked optimism among Israeli diplomats that the next weeks will witness unprecedented progress in normalization discussions with Rabat. “Israeli officials are hopeful that a breakthrough in normalizing relations with Morocco can be achieved in the next few days,” the Times of Israel reported on December 4, citing Israel’s Channel 12. The Channel 12 report, said to be about the meeting between Pompeo and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Lisbon, Portugal, explains how Netanyahu plans to use diplomatic normalization with Morocco to salvage as his own troubled political future. “The Channel 12 report, quoting unnamed senior officials in Jerusalem, said Israel was hoping to present a real diplomatic accomplishment in the next few days, before the end of the period to form a new government expires,” explained the Times of Israel. As he seeks to boost support of at least 61 members out of the 120 at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, Netanyahu is convinced that a diplomatic breakthrough with Morocco, described as one of the “moderate Arab countries,” can help accelerate the effective recognition of the Jewish state in the fraught Middle Eastern affairs. The Israeli PM hopes, too, that such a development would prove a decisive victory for him amid domestic challenges to his premiership. Notable in the reports is that Netanyahu is understood to be expecting the breakthrough with Morocco by December 11, the deadline for the Knesset to move forward with, or block, the formation of a new Israeli government. Still, the reports added, should Morocco not respond favorably by Netanyahu’s preferred deadline, the Israeli PM would be happy to continue pushing for normalization with Rabat and use any significant diplomatic gain for future elections. Pompeo, expected to arrive in Rabat later today, is set to meet with King Mohammed VI, FM Nasser Bourita, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, and Abdellatif Hammouchi, the director of Morocco’s Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Officially, Pompeo and his Moroccan hosts will discuss advancing US-Morocco relations, especially on counter-terrorism and various aspects of regional security and intelligence sharing. The latest reports of imminent normalization between Morocco and Israel now form a crowded repertoire of similar reports—of both confirmed and rumored meetings—of Washington’s push to have Rabat sign non-belligerent agreement with Israel. Such a move would entail an official recognition of Israel and the establishment of official diplomatic links between the two countries. But with King Mohammed VI’s chairmanship of the Al-Quds committee, the Organization of Islamic Conference’s body tasked with maintaining a united Islamic or Arab front on the Palestinian question , Morocco’s insistence on having an independent diplomacy, and—most importantly, perhaps—the prevailing anti-normalization mood in the country’s public opinion, it remains to be seen what will come of Pompeo’s Moroccan visit. At the latest meeting of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo, Morocco renewed its commitment to the “just Palestinian cause” and condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank. “Morocco confirms its firm position on all issues related to the Just Palestinian cause,” said Ahmed Tazi, Morocco’s ambassador to Egypt. “We stand with our Palestinian brothers in their distress and support all their rights, especially the right to establish an independent and viable state of Palestine.”

Rabat – The Arab Maghreb Union’s (AMU) Secretary-General, Taieb Baccouche, has called for reopening the borders between the Maghreb nations to “accelerate Maghreb unity.” The secretary expressed his wish during a meeting with the President of Morocco’s House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, on Wednesday, December 4, in Rabat. The Tunisian politician also commended King Mohammed VI’s “initiatives to start a dialogue” with Algeria. Dialogue is the only way to “overcome the obstacles hindering the achievement of the people’s dream,” said Baccouche. The Moroccan representative agreed with AMU’s secretary. El Malki said that building unity between the Maghreb countries “cannot be achieved without respecting both the nations and the people’s unities and a collective effort in the fight against terrorism and its consequences.” The meeting is part of Baccouche’s efforts to bring together the leaders of AMU’s member states during the upcoming African Union summit in February 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The secretary’s success, however, is yet to be determined. The statements from the two politicians are in line with the AMU’s spirit. The union, established on February 17, 1989, in Marrakech, has the main objective of guaranteeing cooperation between the member states “to take part in the enrichment of the international dialogue, to reinforce their independence, and to safeguard their assets.” Despite existing for more than three decades, AMU has not achieved any tangible progress on its goals. A key factor is the deep economic and political disagreement between Morocco and Algeria regarding, among other issues, the Western Sahara conflict. In his 2019 Throne Day speech, on July 30, King Mohammed VI called for a dialogue with Algeria in the hopes of breaking the stalemate currently hindering the Maghreb unity project. The king said that Morocco has reaffirmed its sincere commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the people of the two sister nations.” The monarch also made a previous call for dialogue in his Green March speech, on November 6, 2018. During the speech, King Mohammed VI invited Algeria to join a “frank” and “direct dialogue,” to restore the diplomatic ties between Rabat and Algiers and to reopen the borders between the two countries. However, the offer for talks did not receive a response from Algeria. Algeria continues to oppose Morocco and to question its territorial integrity by supporting and financing the Polisario Front.

Rabat – A shooting near a nightclub in the city of Norrkoping, southeastern Sweden, has killed two men. The incident took place on the morning of Friday, December 5, at 1:20 am. The victims, aged 40 and 45, later succumbed to their injuries. Police cordoned off several neighborhoods in the city center and launched an investigation to find the culprits. “We have around ten patrols at the scene at the moment,” declared Thomas Agnevik, the police spokesperson, shortly after 3 am. “There are several witnesses who saw things and we have spoken with some of them,” he added. The shooting did not cause any other injuries, however, it did damage the facades and windows of several nearby restaurants. On the same night, another shooting in the town of Katrineholm, about 50 kilometers north of Norrkoping, injured a man in his 20s. Police are still investigating the possibility of a link between the two incidents. Swedish media, who speculate that the incidents were gang-related, reported that gang violence has been on the rise over the past decade. Swedish police recently announced the launch of a temporary task force to focus solely on reducing the number of explosions and shootings in the country.

Rabat – The Moroccan Bank of Foreign Commerce Foundation for Education and Environment (BMCE Bank Foundation) and the Confucius Institute of Tangier at the Abdelmalek Essaadi University signed a partnership agreement on Tuesday, December 3, that will offer Mandarin Chinese to fifth and sixth-year students in Bougdour, a primary school in the Tangier region.  Zhao Jiangping, the counselor and wife of the Chinese ambassador in Morocco, proposed the partnership agreement after visiting a primary school in the Bouskoura municipality in Casablanca where Mandarin is offered to fourth, fifth, and sixth-year students.  The BMCE Bank Foundation and the Confucius Institute of Casablanca at the Hassan II University signed a similar agreement in 2014 that allows the teaching of Mandarin through the network Medersat.com. The agreement meant that the northern Nador area, a geographically remote location, could gain access to language classes.  Zhao Jiangping underlined the importance of integrating Mandarin into schools in her statement: “For Moroccan students, learning the Chinese language allows them to live in a culturally diverse world, provides them with an opportunity to study and pursue professional life in the future.”  The president of BMCE Bank Foundation, Leila Mezian Benjelloun, expressed her hopes of expanding Mandarin courses to other Moroccan schools as well as universities. According to the foundation, she plans to partner with the Ministry of Education to turn her hopes into reality.

Rabat – Mike Pompeo, the chief of the US diplomacy, is due to arrive in Rabat on December 5 for a one-day visit during which he is scheduled to meet with King Mohammed VI and several Moroccan officials to discuss US-Morocco relations. Pompeo’s visit comes at a time when Morocco and the US, while vowing to maintain and nurture their “strategic partnership,” have had minor divergences on specifics. Morocco has not had a US ambassador in years, or more precisely, since Trump took office. David Fischer, Trump’s ambassadorial nominee for Rabat, has failed to secure congressional approval, and the issue has since been left to rest in the diplomatic drawers in Washington. With so many sensitive issues on Trump’s plate in recent months—impeachment investigations, the 2020 elections, and the controversial Trump peace plan for Palestine, among many others—it is even likely that the topic will not be raised for many other months. But that does not mean that the relationship between Rabat and Washington has waned, or suffered deadly blows. In fact, if anything, aside from the short-lived concern over former senior national security advisor John Bolton’s destructive impact on Morocco-US relations, the two allies have time and again made clear their desire to boost their friendship. In recent months, Rabat and Washington have made significant inroads in their security cooperation and have expressed a shared enthusiasm to maintain “strategic partnership” on counterterrorism, deradicalization projects, and a wide range of “shared interests” and priorities in Africa. In recent comments on Pompeo’s visit to Morocco, one senior US official described Morocco as “leader in [countering violent extremism] and bringing back foreign terrorist fighters” and “just a great partner” The suggestion, as has been repeatedly stressed by Pompeo himself in previous statements on US-Morocco relations, is that Morocco is not only an invaluable partner; it is indispensable for the US’ “national interests” in Africa. Morocco is often referred to in diplomatic circles in Washington as a bastion of religious tolerance and socio-political stability. In the world of strategic diplomacy, especially when it comes to intelligence sharing and security cooperation, Morocco’s political stability and world-renowned counter-terrorism architecture are precious, rare, coveted currencies. Of even greater significance for Morocco is the fact that Pompeo will not extend his visit to Algeria, making it the first time since 1982 that a US Secretary of State visits Morocco without visiting its Algerian neighbor. This may sound anodyne to many observers. For Morocco, however—and this would hold for any other country in Morocco’s position, especially given the two neighbor’s pointed rivalry on regional issues—the symbolism of the gesture is a vibrant political statement. What is more, that Pompeo’s visit comes just weeks after that of Ivanka Trump is an even stronger vindication of Rabat’s interpretation of the encouraging symbolism of Pompeo’s visit. “In the spirit of the longstanding friendship between our people and governments, we look forward to strengthening our relationship in the years to come. Ours is a strategic partnership based on our work to advance our shared vision of a secure, stable, and prosperous North Africa and the Middle East,” Pompeo said of Morocco-US relations in late July, as he congratulated King Mohammed VI on his two decades on the throne. One should expect him to stand by that line of reasoning in his scheduled meetings with Moroccan leaders. From there, however, the sense of déjà-vu, the familiar narrative of Morocco being the US’ strongest ally in North Africa is set to get a little bit more colorful, complicated. For behind the diplomatic platitudes, the mutually congratulatory tone in statements from the US and Morocco about their partnership, there have been tiny cracks, mild disagreements on specific issues. The last-minute change in Pompeo’s Moroccan schedule—delaying, shortening his stay, as well including Israel in the broader picture—suggests that Washington plans to push Rabat to change course on Trump’s “Deal of the Century” in the Israel-Palestine conflict. This is a question on which Morocco has made its stance crystal clear, with the country’s Lower House recently condemning Israel’s Netanyahu’s adventurism in the West Bank and vowing to support Palestinians’ “right to return.” Meanwhile, Morocco will most likely use Pompeo’s visit to try to have the US provide a more decisive support for its Western Sahara agenda. While the US has been among countries that have consistently acknowledged the seriousness and pragmatism of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan—with recent reports even suggesting that Washington was behind the very idea of Morocco’s autonomy proposal—there is an abiding feeling in Rabat that its American ally has not been sufficiently supportive of its Western Sahara aspirations. Some Morocco-friendly analysts have recently gone as far as boldly accusing the US of betraying Morocco, in spite of Rabat’s proven, unwavering commitment to its partnership with Washington. While it is unlikely that Morocco support the “Deal of the Century” to secure more consequential US support for its Western Sahara agenda, a change in the US’s current stance on Western Sahara—a delicate diplomacy based on keeping the status quo by hurting neither of the conflicting parties—is equally improbable in the short or medium term. Morocco’s diplomacy seems to have espoused an active hope-inspired belief that patience and sustained efforts to show the genuineness of its Western Sahara agenda will eventually pay off. This a policy shift that has been labeled as “proactive diplomacy”—a marked move away from reactionary diplomacy. It means that Rabat will probably not see its divergences with the US as an insurmountable impasse. From Morocco’s perspective, bold, consequential diplomatic actions come, more often than not, after a series of seemingly insignificant, symbolic gestures. The successive visits of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and now Pompeo are, as far Moroccan diplomats are concerned, good omens for the bilateral relations as well as Morocco’s long-term strategic interests. It is hard, at this point, to argue that they are wrong.

Rabat – The Canadian government has joined Spain in advising its citizens against travelling to the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria as well as the entire Sahel region, citing kidnappings and terrorism in the region. The statement, initially issued in September, has recently been updated so that it is “valid” for December. It paints a deeply worrying picture of security in the Sahel.  While Canada’s statement validates similar warnings from Spain, the Canadian government’s statement goes further by listing Algeria itself (and not just the Polisario-run camps) as a destination to avoid this month.  The statement does not go into specifics about its listing Algeria as a place to avoid. It suggests, however, that the ongoing anti-establishment popular movements in the North African country are likely to cause more instability in post-Bouteflika Algeria.  With masses of Algerians marching every Friday since February to vent their frustration at the political survival of some faces from the Bouteflika decades and express their opposition to the upcoming elections, there is a wide belief that there is no end in sight for the country’s instability.  “Exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of civil unrest and the threat of terrorism,” reads the statement, suggesting that the arm-wrestling between protesting Algerians and the political elite might deescalate as neither camp appears willing to relent on its position. The warning also points to the growing instability in the Sahel region, where terrorist groups, including ISIS and Al Qaeda have established a stronghold to bounce back from their recent strategic losses in the Middle East.  With the groups’ rise in prominence in the Sahel region, Canada warns its citizens against going to “areas bordering Libya, Tunisia, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania.”  In Algeria, the North American country emphatically urged citizens to “avoid travel” to a number of provinces, including Tindouf. “There are armed groups operating in these areas. There is also threat of terrorism, banditry, and kidnapping,” said the statement. The news comes a week after an alarmed Spain called on its citizens to avoid Tindouf. Like Canada, Spain also cited terrorism and kidnapping threats usually targeting foreign—mostly Western—nationals.  There have also been reports of Algeria addressing a warning letter to the MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, about kidnappings and other security risks in the Tindouf camps. Algiers has since denied the reports, claiming it has “full control” over Tindouf.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Meteorological Directorate announced today, December 4, that the ongoing wave of cold and rainy weather currently hitting several regions of the kingdom will continue until at least Friday, December 6. The directorate announced heavy rain in the provinces of Ouazzane, Chefchaouen, Taounate, Kenitra, and Larache on Wednesday between 2pm and midnight. On Thursday, heavy thunderstorms will hit the provinces of Tiznit, Sidi Ifni, and Chtouka-Ait Baha between 12 and 7pm.

The provinces of Al Haouz, Midelt, Tinghir, and Ouarzazate will expect snowfalls between Thursday at 8pm and Friday midnight. As cold waves in Morocco can be very intense, especially in mountainous areas, the Moroccan government has launched the 2019-2020 national plan to support the population during the cold waves. On November 27, Ministry of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced that more than 736,000 Moroccans, living in over 27 different provinces, will benefit from the plan.

Rabat – The second meeting of the Moroccan-Saudi joint military commission took place on Tuesday, November 3, in Rabat. The meeting focused on the results of the bilateral military cooperation between the two kingdoms and looked towards future activities. Lieutenant General Abdelfattah Lourak, Inspector General of the Royal Armed Forces of Morocco (FAR), and Saudi Arabia’s chief of international military cooperation co-chaired the meeting.  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the meeting focused on several areas of common interest. The participants discussed the various aspects of military cooperation and expressed their satisfaction with the “excellent partnership” between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Participants also voiced their willingness to strengthen relations between the two armies by sharing experience and expertise, MAP added.  The military cooperation between the two royal armed forces is based on the deep historical ties between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, according to a statement by the FAR General Staff.  The two countries signed a framework agreement for military and technical cooperation in December 2015. The agreement touches on training, logistical support, transfer of military expertise, military medical services, and the exchange of visits.  While the relationship between Morocco and Saudi Arabia has historically been strong, bilateral relations reached a low in March 2019 when Morocco recalled its ambassador to Riyadh. The move came shortly after Morocco withdrew its military forces from the Saudi-led war in Yemen.  Amid these tensions, King Mohammed VI sent a message of good wishes and “fraternity” to King Salman of Saudi Arabia in April 2019. The Saudi monarch warmly received the message, and tensions between the two kingdoms have since quelled.  King Mohammed VI sent his congratulations to King Salman on November 30 as the Saudi monarch celebrated five years on the throne. In the same message, King Mohammed VI reiterated his determination to work with King Salman to strengthen the relations between their countries in order to serve their peoples’ interests.

Rabat – Moroccan police seized 1,138 kilograms of cannabis resin near the city of Errachidia, eastern Morocco, on the morning of Wednesday, December 4. Authorities also arrested two suspects, aged 21 and 29, for their alleged links to an international drug trafficking network. Police arrested the suspects aboard two vehicles about 160 kilometers to the east of Errachidia, heading in the direction of the Algerian border. In addition to cannabis resin, police also seized fake vehicle registration plates. The investigation to identify any further suspects involved in this criminal network is ongoing. The arrests are part of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security’s (DGSN) war against drug trafficking all over the country. On November 20, police arrested two suspects in possession of 3 tons and 357 kilograms of cannabis resin concealed in 70 large packets near the rural town of Tazarine, eastern Morocco. On the 12th day of the same month, DGSN arrested a Romanian woman and seized 159 kilograms of cannabis resin at the Ceuta crossing point. According to DGSN, Moroccan police have seized more than 112 tons of cannabis and its derivatives between January 1, 2019, and September 15. In the same period, authorities arrested 420,348 suspects on charges of drug trafficking, out of which 331,252 were arrested when found in possession of drugs.

Rabat – Human Rights Watch has issued a statement in support of reforms to the penal code that Morocco’s National Human Rights Council (CNDH) proposed on October 28. The proposal includes repealing laws that criminalize a number of controversial actions, including having sex outside of marriage, having homosexual relations, and proselytizing or “shaking the faith” of Muslims as well as reforming the law on abortion. The individual rights watchdog described CNDH’s memorandum as containing “groundbreaking proposals” to reform Morocco’s penal code. HRW’s Middle East and North Africa communications director, Ahmed Benchemsi, argued “Morocco’s parliament should take the State out of people’s bedrooms and let them pursue their consensual private lives without fear of trials and prison time.” He added that CNDH’s proposals would help “protect personal liberties” in Morocco. The CNDH suggested that Parliament repeal articles of the penal code that criminalize certain sexual acts forbidden in Islam, such as homosexual relations, sex outside of marriage, and adultery.  In Morocco, abortion is illegal unless performed to save the mother’s health, but the CNDH memo calls for the definition to be widened to allow abortion if it would save the mother’s “physical, mental and social health.” The CNDH is also calling for the government to amend or discard Article 220, which criminalizes religious proselytism and conversion from Islam to another religion. Moroccan Christians have faced charges of proselytizing due to the law, and the government has deported foreign Christians on the same charges.  All the reforms, the CNDH said, would lead to “a penal code that protects freedoms and takes into account the principles of legitimacy, necessity, and proportionality.” Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, a member of the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), has not reacted positively to the memorandum. Departing from religious givens is a red line, El Othmani said on November 16.  El Othmani reminded the public that Islamic principles guide the Moroccan government. There is space for understanding or interpreting the principles within an innovative framework, however, he said. Morocco’s Ulemma, a body of religious scholars that advises the government, put out a statement this week saying any changes to abortion law would follow “ijtihad,” the process by which amendments to Islamic law are made.

Rabat – The Spanish government began removing the wire fences planted along the 8.2-kilometer border of the Spanish enclave city of Ceuta with Morocco on Tuesday, December 3.  Spain also plans to update Melilla’s border fences. The removal works will be carried out over several months, police sources told Spanish newspaper EFE. Spain has commissioned a public company with removing the wire fences in order to replace them with more secure fences to better monitor the borders. Spanish authorities installed the wire fences in October 2005, at a time of great migratory pressure on the two Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla. The borders of both Spanish enclaves are surrounded by a ring of two sets of meters-high barbed wire fences to prevent the entry of undocumented immigrants. The fences have failed to prevent some irregular migration attempts, mainly from sub-Saharan immigrants. On several occasions, migrants have rushed at the fences in large groups in an attempt to cross into Spanish territory. For years, humanitarian organizations have requested the removal of the barbed wire, considering it dangerous and ineffective in deterring undocumented migration. Spain now seeks to improve and modernize the border crossings in Ceuta (El Tarajal) and Melilla (Beni Enzar) by setting up a facial recognition system. With a budget of more than €32 million, the project is likely to be co-financed up to 75% by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), EFE pointed out.  Thanks to Morocco’s efforts in tackling irregular migration, Spain has seen a significant decline in the flow of undocumented migrants in 2019.  The number of irregular migrants arriving by sea in Spain has declined to 24,031, a drop of 55% compared to the same period last year, according to the Spanish Ministry of the Interior figures from January to December 2019. During the same period in 2018, 53,004 migrants reached Spain by sea. Meanwhile, from January to December 2019, around 1,098 boats arrived on the Spanish coast, compared to 1,959 boats, in 2018.  Through 2019, the number of illegal migrants arriving by land in Spain declined from 6,288 to 5,744, recording a drop of 8.7%.

Rabat – Jean Paul Carteron, the founding president of the Crans Montana Forum, has hailed Morocco’s recent reforms and development projects, particularly acknowledging the North African kingdom’s efforts in Western Sahara and the economic “miracle” it has operated there. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the Swiss businessman said Morocco’s recent reforms have made it possible for the country to attract global and continental interests, successfully branding itself as a reliable and serious partner in dialogue on regional and worldwide issues. In addition to becoming a prominent and assertive voice in Africa, Carteron stressed, Morocco is also emerging as an example of a “success story” for other African countries to emulate. “In a continent where hope has often seemed to have deserted, where populations still suffer, where States have difficulty taking advantage of their extraordinary natural resources, Morocco has demonstrated a spectacular success story that has become an example for all its sister countries, and the effectiveness of good governance,” he said. To illustrate his praise of Morocco’s “success story” and growing “African responsibility,” he provided a list of the country’s recent development projects and political reforms. He cited the kingdom’s high speed train, its burgeoning aeronautical and automotive sectors, as well as its increasing financial and political influence across Africa. “[Morocco] is today an engine of growth,” he emphasized. In recent years, the regions of Dakhla and Laayoune in Western Sahara took the lion’s share of Morocco’s public investment, with the kingdom boldly expressing its desire to accelerate the region’s socio-economic integration with the rest of Morocco and transform it into a regional investment hub. Commenting on the transformations witnessed in the region, Carteron said that the efforts “testify to the success of policies implemented by Morocco.” The statement comes months ahead of the Crans Montana Forum. Relocated to Dakhla since 2015, the forum styles itself as “Africa’s Davos,” annually bringing together thousands of business leaders, civil society organizations, and political leaders from around the world to discuss themes relevant to investments and governance in Africa. This is not the first time that Carteron has praised both Morocco’s new development model and its enormous public investments efforts in the southern provinces. “Morocco builds in Dakhla the very example of the African miracle,” Carteron said earlier this year at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Crans Montana Forum.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie has seized large quantities of a dangerous chemical near the small town of Moulay Bousselham, 120 kilometers south of Tangier. According to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae, gendarmes identified the chemical as nitric acid.  Scientists and senior members of the Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie discovered the nitric acid hidden in a truck.  The driver of the vehicle claimed that the chemicals were “agricultural pesticides intended for a strawberry farm and produced in Mohammedia,” Al Massae reported. According to the Royal Gendarmerie, the quantity of nitric acid seized is “often used in the manufacturing of explosives.”   Upon further investigation, the Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie reports that the truck’s license plates were non-compliant and falsified. The driver also failed to produce proof of authorization for the handling of the chemicals.  The Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie has arrested the driver and placed him in custody.  Upon request from the gendarmerie, the National Office of the Agricultural Council and the National Office of Food Safety plans to write a report on the chemicals as the investigation continues.

Rabat – A Moroccan farmer has lost his genitals after confronting a hunter in the rural Houdererrane village 90 kilometers east of Rabat.  The elderly assailant is a member of a hunting association, according to the Arabic-language daily Assabah. He and several other members were hunting in the forests of Houderrane, in the Khemisset region. The farmer confronted the group and asked them to leave his land. A fight broke out, and the elderly hunter shot the farmer, injuring him in his genitals.  Local gendarmes arrived at the scene to arrest the hunter and transport the victim to the Khemisset provincial hospital. Casablanca media reported that the victim later moved to the Ibn Sina University Hospital in Rabat.  The Rabat Court of Appeals transferred the hunter to the regional director of the Royal Khemisset Gendarmerie for a thorough investigation, according to Le360.  The hunter denied having voluntarily shot the farmer. He claimed to have not seen the farmer at the time of the shooting. The victim, on the other hand, insists that the hunter tried to kill him.  The case will be brought before a judge in the coming days.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), dismantled a terrorist cell on Wednesday, December 4, in the province of Nador in northeast Morocco. As part of the operation, BCIJ agents arrested three suspects aged between 24 and 39 years old. According to the BCIJ statement, the operation, part of the joint security cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish security services, police arrested the three terrorists in the remote areas of Farkhana and Bani Nassar in Nador province.  One of the suspects is the brother of a fighter known to be operating the Syria-Iraq arena. The dismantling of the cell came in parallel with the arrest of the cell’s leader on the outskirts of the Spanish capital, Madrid. The statement added that preliminary investigations confirmed that the cell’s members were engaged in campaigns promoting and praising ISIS’ extremist ideology as well as threatening retaliation attacks after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  According to the BCIJ, the terrorists had been holding meetings to track the current situation in the Syria-Iraq arena, as well as planning to carry out terrorist operations in response to the repeated calls of ISIS leaders to target certain countries. The operation resulted in the seizure of electronic equipment, mobile phones, masks, books, and manuscripts full of extremist ideology. The joint security operation comes amid the escalating terrorist threats in Morocco and Spain, added the statement. The statement pointed out that ISIS followers are strengthening their activities outside the hotbeds of tension by launching incitement campaigns directed to ISIS followers in various countries.  The statement concluded that the suspects will be brought to justice immediately after the completion of the investigation process.  Morocco and Spain are strong allies in combatting terrorism. The two countries share intelligence on cross-border terrorist activities. In September 2018, then Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said that Morocco-Spain cooperation “is an example to follow for other countries,” as the globe struggles to confront terrorist movements at home and abroad. In addition to Spain, Morocco also cooperates with the US and France on counterterrorism.

Rabat – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has delayed and cut in half his trip to Morocco. In an earlier press statement, the State Department announced that Pompeo would be in Morocco December 4-6 to meet King Mohammed VI. Instead, the secretary has shortened his trip to one day, Thursday, December 5. Pompeo has been attending the NATO Leaders Meeting with President Donald Trump in London. Instead of traveling on to Morocco, he moved forward a day of meetings in Portugal to Wednesday, December 4, and delayed his Morocco trip by one day. In Portugal, Pompeo is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  A former American ambassador, Gerald Feierstein, highlighted the relationship between Morocco and the US in an interview with state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press ahead of Pompeo’s trip. “The U.S. clearly continues to look to Morocco to help advance important regional objectives, including combating violent extremism and promoting a just and sustainable resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.” During a telephone press briefing last week, a senior state department official alleged that Morocco “has these quiet ties and relationship with Israel as well, as we all know,” a statement the Moroccan public may not receive well. Morocco frequently issues statements of support to the Palestinian people and sends aid. The State Department says that during his visit, Pompeo will meet with “a range of government officials to review our countries’ strong economic and security partnership.” In the telephone briefing, the official also commented that the Western Sahara conflict would likely come up in Pompeo’s talks with Moroccan leaders. The diplomat had high praise for Morocco as “across the board a leader in [countering violent extremism] and bringing back foreign terrorist fighters.” Feierstein also remarked that Morocco’s work in deradicalization and training of imams is signigicant in the global confrontation with terrorism.

Rabat – The Global Firepower Index, a military strength ranking, put the Moroccan military in the 61st position out of 137 countries worldwide. The ranking also placed Morocco at sixth in Africa. However, the kingdom lost six positions compared to the 2018 rankings when it ranked 55th. The ranking compares the potential war capability of nations based on more than 50 factors, including resources; manpower; finances; geography; and the country’s naval, land, and air forces. Morocco earned a score of 0.8244. The closer the score is to zero, the stronger the army. In Africa, Morocco ranked sixth, behind Egypt (12th globally), Algeria (27th), South Africa (32nd), Nigeria (44th), Ethiopia (47th), and Angola (58th). On the global scale, the United States has the strongest military, followed by Russia, China, India, France, and Japan. Morocco had the best score for its airpower. According to the index, Morocco has the 35th strongest air arsenal in the world. In terms of military spending, Morocco ranked 51st in the world and 8th in the MENA region, with $3.4 billion spent in 2019. Saudi Arabia is the country that spends the most on its military in the Arab world, and the third globally, followed by the UAE (16th globally) and Algeria (21st). The index also states that 50% of the Moroccan population falls within the age range for military service. Today, the Moroccan army has 346,000 soldiers, 196,000 on active service and 150,000 in reserve.

Rabat – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is set to open their third Moroccan office in the city of Agadir on Monday, December 9. The Agadir office is set to cover the regions of Sous-Massa and Marrakech-Safi, two key economic areas in Morocco. Sous Massa’s economy relies on small and medium enterprises as well as a thriving fishing industry. The Marrakech-Safi region, meanwhile, relies on its agriculture and tourism. According to the bank, the two regions’ combined annual revenue represents 16.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).  With the opening of their new office, EBRD say they aim to “support a broad range of opportunities for development partnerships” while integrating their “know-how” and “best practices” into the regions’ economies.  The new office in Agadir will be pivotal in “boosting the creation of high-quality private-sector jobs and developing a resilient economy,” say EBRD. In addition to opening offices in Tangier and Casablanca, EBRD Vice President, Alain Pilloux states: “Our new office in Agadir confirms our commitment to developing the economy in Morocco by strengthening our activities and promoting regional integration. These steps will play the role of a catalyst for job creation.” EBRD also emphasizes the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Beginning in 2012, EBRD has funded 58 support projects, totalling almost €2 billion. One of their most recent projects includes investment in BMCE bank bonds with the expectation BMCE will increase their loan profile to Moroccan SMEs. Another project includes provisions to the Moroccan General Society of Banks (SGMB).  EBRD funds more than 600 support projects, both private and public, through accessible technical and financial consultancy services and expertise in all economic sectors of Morocco.

Rabat – Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has once again lashed out at the El Othmani-led government, especially calling out the current head of government for his poor choice of ministers during the recent ministerial reshuffle. A traditional government critic since he left his head of government post in November 2017, the erratic and feisty Benkirane, a veteran member and proclaimed “spiritual guide” of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) has not been out of the political limelight for months. Since his much-reported feud with El Othmani on the recently adopted education bill, Benkirane had stayed out of political sight, only sporadically and rather uncontroversially commenting on the future of the PJD. Breaking the months-long relative silence over the weekend, however, the former PJD chief told a group of PJD youth at his home in Rabat that he has had a hard time understanding some of El Othmani’s choices when appointing ministers. “I have failed to find a reasonable explanation” for the sacking of some ministers, he insisted, emphasizing the “handiwork” and dedication of some outgoing ministers, especially from the PJD, whom he believes were doing “very good” work. He then named Mustapha El Khalfi, the former government spokesperson (and, of course, an influential PJD member), as the perfect illustration of ministers who should have not been replaced. “People are not happy with El Khalfi’s departure,” he said. He went on to explain that while El Khalfi is surely “not a genius, he is a hard worker and good researcher.” The comment may come across as a veiled criticism of Hassan Abyaba, the newly appointed minister for culture, sports, and youth as well as government spokesperson. Abyaba’s first press conferences have been below the standard El Khalfi set when summarizing the talking points of government meetings or explaining the government’s positions on sensitive topics. At the same time, however, while many have also criticized the government reshuffle, Benkirane’s praise of outgoing PJD ministers may raise questions about his partisan rhetoric. Following the government reshuffle, most critics, rather than complain about the departure of some members, expressed doubts about the new government’s ability to actually deliver the changes that have been promised. Critics of the government reshuffle were mostly concerned about the triumph of continuity over rupture, as promised by the King. But Benkirane’s message appears to suggest that he is concerned that there was insufficient continuity in the ministerial appointments. As if to respond to that prospective rebuttal of his conservative and PJD-embracing criticism of the new government, however, Benkirane said that he is mostly concerned about “what can be done to change the country, rather than returning, going back to the 1970s.” But whether his defense—that he wants change rather than a return to old values—works remains to be seen. In most of his latest tirades against the El Othmani-led government, Benkirane has decried what he saw as El Othmani’s tendency to pander to Moroccan progressives. The most striking example is a 26-minute video in which, fuming at the draft law on the adoption of French as the language of instruction for science in Moroccan schools, Benkirane lampooned El Othmani and other PJD ministers and MPs who were supportive of the legislative move. He labeled them “cowards” and “traitors” who have forgotten and “betrayed” the cultural and religious tenets of the Moroccan society, emphatically calling El Othmani out for apparently siding with progressive Moroccans and calling the law a “betrayal of the principles of the party and the [Moroccan] Constitution and its vision.”

Rabat – Morocco’s House of Representatives, or lower house, reiterated its unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people on Tuesday, December 3.  The lower house affirmed that it stands with the Palestinian people in their legitimate resistance against Israel to recover their national rights, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Such rights include an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.  The announcement of support follows the 42nd observance of the annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, November 29.  November 29 marks the anniversary of Resolution 181, or the partition of Palestine. In 1947, the UN General Assembly divided Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the city of Jerusalem governed by a separate entity. Palestine’s Jewish community took Resolution 181 as a legal basis for the establishment of Israel, while the Arab community rejected the resolution. Violence erupted almost immediately.   In 1977, the UN General Assembly called for the annual observance of November 29 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  In affirming its solidarity with the Palestinian cause, Morocco’s House of Representatives also recalled Land Day, observed every year on March 30. The commemoration remembers the general strike and marches that took place in Israel in March 1976.  The lower house recalled the sacrifices the Palestinian people made to recover their occupied territories.  The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People calls upon the international public, the UN, and policymakers to renew their commitment to the just cause of Palestine and to work towards a fair solution to the conflict in the Middle East, according to the lower house’s statement.  “Such a solution will have to comply with the resolutions of international legality and put an end to Israeli arrogance as well as to efforts to liquidate the Palestinian issue, including the inadmissible recognition of [Jerusalem] as the capital of Israel by the US [government] and its attempts to legitimize colonization policies,” the statement continues.  The lower house praised King Mohammed VI’s November 29 statement, when the sovereign reiterated Morocco’s steadfast position in favor of Palestine and the legitimate rights of its people. The King addressed the message to the chairman of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Cheikh Niang. Just days earlier on November 25, Morocco renewed its steadfast support for Palestine through its Moroccan ambassador to Cairo, Ahmed Tazi. “We stand with our Palestinian brothers in their distress and support all their rights, especially the right to establish an independent and viable state of Palestine,” Tazi said in a meeting of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers.  November saw one of the most deadly escalations in the region in recent years, with hundreds of Palestinians injured and dozens killed.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has renewed his country’s commitment to mitigating the global climate crisis, citing Morocco’s domestic “ambitions” and international “solidarity.” Increasingly assertive on both global and regional platforms, Morocco misses no opportunity to brand itself as a rule-abiding player in world affairs and a pertinent voice on a wide range of issues of regional and worldwide significance. El Othmani said as much as he headed an important Moroccan delegation at COP25, the two-week climate summit that officially kicked off Monday, December 2, in Spain. The Madrid meeting is taking place in a global climate of environmental urgency and anxiety, especially given the dire warnings from the scientific community. Just last month, 10 Moroccan scientists joined a large community of 11,000 scientists from 153 countries in urging for global and immediate action to tackle what they described as a “climate emergency.” Central to the growing worry over the practical significance of events such as COP25 is the fact that few countries have actually implemented sustainable policies, in spite of the recent series of “global dialogues” and discussions on the issue. In most instances, countries are seen as eager to participate in global, emergency-themed events, where on-paper commitments are made and a series of documents signed. But when it comes to actually implementing the policies that their “global commitments” entail, most governments are dragging their feet, leading many critics and activists to question the sincerity and effectiveness of commitments made at international conferences like COP25. El Othmani’s speech in Madrid on Monday, December 2, while not a decisive rebuttal to critics’ and activists’ doubts, was a reassurance that Morocco is at least among the still insignificant number of governments doing their best to integrate environmental concerns in their policy choices. Conscious of the “worrying impact” of environmental degradation, Morocco, El Othmani argued, has espoused an “ambitious and solidarity-driven” attitude to tackling the global climate emergency. In the Moroccan head of government’s reckoning, while Rabat has grown distinctly “ambitious” in how it deals with climate and environment-related policies—from sustainable agriculture to renewable energy and the Zero-Mika ambition—the fact remains that “global solidarity” is required to successfully come to terms with an issue of global reach and ramifications. As El Othmani sees it, Morocco is already on track, “shouldering its regional responsibilities.” But, he stressed, for the sake of efficiency and more palpable impact, Rabat is ready to engage further by embracing and implementing all global decisions and commitments on mitigating the devastating impact of the human-caused climate crisis. It all boils down to “responsibility” and “ambition” at the domestic level and “solidarity” on the global front. “Under the leadership and the personal involvement of King Mohammed VI, Morocco has opted for an ambitious and solidarity-driven approach in its actions and interventions at the national, regional, and worldwide levels,” he said. The Moroccan head of government’s statements come at a time when the North African country has been lauded by international observers for its “ambitious” environment-friendly policies and its commitment to regional and multilateral platforms on the issue. “Electricity demand has doubled since 2010 and by 2030 we want Morocco to be one of the first countries in the world for renewable to exceed share of fossil energy,” Yassir Badih, senior project manager at the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), told CNN for a report the American outlet did in early 2019. While the ambition to achieve worldwide leadership on renewable energy is bold and still far away, recent reports suggests that Morocco is on track, that its sustainability policies are effective and encouraging. A recent ranking showed Morocco comes 13th for energy efficiency, suggesting the country is among the world leaders—and by far Africa’s leader—on sustainability and renewable energy.

Rabat – UNESCO sent a letter to the Moroccan government expressing their “great regret” at not receiving details about the ongoing urban development projects in Rabat in July 2019, reported Spanish news agency EFE this week. In 2012, UNESCO designated Rabat as a World Heritage Site for its historic features and the remnants of different civilizations in the city. UNESCO’s acknowledgment, however, requires local authorities to communicate in advance any large urban projects that could modify the city’s architecture. The Spanish outlet explains that the Moroccan government did not send any correspondence to the UN organization before launching construction work on the projects. UNESCO also warned the Moroccan government that they have until February 2020 to carry out an “impact study” on the projects, with an emphasis on the visual and landscape changes that will come with them. For UNESCO, the two most problematic projects are the Mohammed VI Tower and the extension of the Rabat Ville train station. The Mohammed VI Tower, expected to open in 2022, will be the highest tower in Africa, sitting at 250 meters with 45 floors. It will rise in the estuary of the Bouregreg River, where the tallest buildings only have three floors. UNESCO objects to the “potentially negative visual impact that the tower project could have” on the Bouregreg valley. The contractor undertaking the building of the tower has already started construction. The tower foundations are already in place and the entire base is finished; its rise is only a matter of months, according to one of its architects, Rafael de la Hoz. Moroccan authorities may defend their case by confirming that the tower will rise outside of the protected heritage zone, marked by the Bouregreg River. The second project that attracted UNESCO’s negative remarks is the building of a commercial center on top of the almost-one-century-old Rabat Ville train station. French colonizers built the station in 1923. Rabat Ville is known for being small and discreet, with tracks going underground. Both the station and its neighboring avenues have maintained the same building style since the early 1900s. However, the ongoing renovation and extension projects include a large commercial center made of glass and steel on top of the historical station, near the Almohad wall that was built in the 12th century. UNESCO expressed its “regret that [the government] has not been able to make minor modifications in the project of the station to mitigate its impact on the city walls.”

Rabat – The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) placed Morocco 75th out of 79 countries that participated in an international assessment that evaluates 15-year-old students’ abilities in reading, mathematics, and science.  Chinese students dominated the top of the ranking in every domain of study, beating Singapore—the country that occupied the top spot in 2015. China did not place in the top five on the 2015 rankings. Around 600,000 students from across 79 countries sat for the two-hour computer-based assessment. Morocco placed ahead of the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Lebanon, and Kosovo.  This is Morocco’s first participation in the international assessment that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been conducting since 2000. Morocco is the only African country assessed alongside five Arab countries: Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the UAE. Conducted every three years, the study took place in April 2018 on a sample of 6,814 Moroccan students from 179 secondary schools.   In every domain of study, Moroccan students scored below the PISA’s average score. For reading, Moroccan students achieved a score of 359 points, far below PISA’s international average of 487.  Morocco’s national average score in mathematics is 368 points, over 100 points below the international average of 489. In science, Moroccan students attained a score of 377 points, compared to an international average of 590 points. The Ministry of Education pointed out that social background is not a factor since 13% of students tested came from vulnerable populations but were able to obtain the national average. The PISA report is one of a number of education-related reports that have ranked Morocco in low spots. In November 2018, the World Bank published a report outlining deficiencies in Morocco’s educational system. The report, “Expectations and Aspirations: A new framework for education,” suggests that Moroccan curricula depend heavily on rote learning, a memorization technique based on repetition. The World Bank noted that the learning method is not effective and makes students unable to exhibit a basic understanding of day-to-day knowledge application.

Rabat – Seven-year-old Yassir El Khoukhi, a Moroccan boy who aspires to become a police officer, fulfilled his dream on Saturday, November 30, with a trip to the Police Prefecture of Casablanca. A video of the “little policeman” went viral on Moroccan social media networks a few months ago. In the video, the boy is wearing a police uniform and brandishing a handheld radio transceiver, or walkie-talkie.   The boy described his dreams of becoming a police officer to the person recording the video.  Yassir cited Abdellatif Hammouchi, head of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), and Abdelhak El Khiame, head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), as his main role models.  Yassir also explained that he had learned the articles of Morocco’s penal code by heart.  The DGSN invited Yassir to visit the various facilities used by security services in Casablanca, according to the news outlet 2M. The boy received a guided tour of the Police Prefecture of Casablanca along with detailed explanations of the various types of police work.  Abdellah El Wardi, the chief officer at the Casablanca prefecture, gifted Yassir with a uniform and a badge.  Last June, Morocco’s DGSN received another young boy at the police headquarters in Rabat. Saad, a young cancer patient, also dreams of becoming a police officer. La #DGSN exauce le rêve de Saad. Un jeune qui lutte avec courage contre le cancer et qui rêvait de devenir policier. Une visite lui a été spécialement organisée à la préfecture de police de Rabat.

Rabat – In response to the ongoing public debate about abortion, Morocco’s Higher Council of the Ulema (Islamic scholars) has affirmed that any amendments to abortion laws in Morocco’s penal code will be based on “ijtihad.” Ijtihad is a technical term of Islamic law. It describes the process of making a new legal decision or amending an existing one through an independent interpretation of religious texts that is up-to-date with present social contexts. The council explained that the chapter criminalizing abortion in the penal code was drafted after a lot of hard work and consultation between several institutions. As an institution with consultative roles in law drafting, the council reaffirmed its position on the debate. They explained that the mechanism with which they participate in public debates is “known,” referring to its role as a body of religious experts. International human rights lawyer Stephanie Willman Bordat told Morocco World News that the council’s announcement could be a way to lay the ground for upcoming amendments to the penal code without deviating from religious laws. The role of the Higher Council of the Ulema in the lawmaking process is purely consultative. In the end, it is for the government and Parliament to approve of any amendments. Articles 449 to 458 of the Moroccan penal code criminalize abortion, with the exception of cases where the mother’s health is endangered. A number of Moroccan NGOs continued a public debate on the penalization of abortion after police arrested Hajar Raissouni on abortion and extra-marital sex charges. The NGOs expressed their demands for the decriminalization of abortion and other individual freedoms. The debate sparked in August 2019 after journalist Raissouni and her then fiance’s arrest for undergoing and participating in illegal abortion. The couple received a one-year prison sentence from a Rabat court. In October, King Mohammed VI granted a royal pardon to Raissouni and her now husband. The pardon also included the doctor and medical staff arrested for performing the alleged abortion. As Morocco’s sovereign, King Mohammed VI chairs the Higher Council of the Ulema.

Caley Koch  Rabat – The National Union of Public Health has called for a “neutral inquiry” into medical negligence at Princess Lalla Meryam hospital in Larache, northern Morocco, after an initial inquiry found that a mother and her newborn baby died due to medical negligence, Le Site Info reports.  The young mother and child died in a local Larache hospital on September 22. The public prosecutor’s office ordered the arrest of the doctor and the two midwives and charged them with negligence to assist, endangerment of a pregnant woman, manslaughter by negligence, discrimination, corruption, as well as physical and psychological violence.  However, the National Union of Public Health is arguing that the initial investigation was not impartial, and are calling for a new investigation to be opened into the case. While members of the public are demanding a “fair trial,” the National Union of Public Health promises to monitor the developments of the ongoing case.  The prosecutor’s office released the first midwife after she paid $1,041 of bail, says Le 360. The attorney representing the doctor and remaining midwife argued for their release, but the court rejected the request due to the seriousness of the charges against them.  On October 2, the doctor spoke in front of the prosecutor and claimed that he was unaware of the victim’s medical state; however, the second midwife claimed that she had informed him of the urgency of the situation.  The midwife, who is currently on bail, also claimed that she was preoccupied with caring for other maternal patients and took no action in addressing the victim’s urgent condition herself. Medical malpractice is a growing issue in Morocco, mainly due to lack of materials such as surgical instruments and ambulances, a shortage of qualified doctors, inadequate training, lack of communication, and overcrowded hospitals.  The medical state in Morocco is demonstrated in Casablanca. According to local optician Dr. Sbioui, there is only one doctor per day for every 250 patients in Casablanca. However, the doctor acknowledged there are efforts being made as a Casablanca medical school can now receive up to 240 students, almost twice as many as it could before.  Khaled Ait Taleb, the minister of health, recently stated that the ministry’s budget was not large enough to provide adequate resources to resolve the numerous and growing health issues in Morocco but ensured that the resources at hand would be put to “optimal use.”

Caley Koch Rabat – Lil Wayne performed at the sold-out Diriyah Music Festival on Saturday, November 30, alongside Tyga and Future as part of Saudia Arabia’s Ad Diriyah season in the capital Riyadh.  However, the rapper found himself facing strict laws concerning drug use.  In an angry tweet, Lil Wayne stated that he is “never going to Riyadh again.”  There was no further elaboration, yet commentators and spectators suspect that he was sent back to the US for the use of marijuana. Drug use of any kind is illegal in Saudia Arabia, with police arresting users. Saudi Arabia also punishes drug dealing with the death penalty.  Saudi Arabians did not take the rapper’s tweet lightly. In response to the US rapper’s tweet, many Saudia Arabian Twitter users criticized him for not considering Saudi law before traveling to the country.  Drugs are not allowed in Saudia Arabia and I am sure that our guys informed you before, and you thought that we are kidding,so shut up and go back to your home . — GASSAN (@gassan_z) December 1, 2019  With all due respect, when you receive an invitation from a foreign country, before accepting that invitation, would you please read about the country and its regulations first? Not allowing weed in Saudi doesnt make us bad. FYI, even in US, some states still prohibiting weed — تركي البقعاوي 🇸🇦 (@TS_Observer) December 1, 2019  Im sure they have informed you, drugs are not allowed here. But you though we are in desert, who will know !! — نواف العصيمي (@NawafOsaimi) December 1, 2019  Lil Wayne has since deleted his tweet. This is not the first time that performers have run into trouble with Saudi Arabian laws against drug use.  In 2017, a local singer was arrested for performing “the dab,” a popular dance move that originated from Atlanta rapper Skippa da Flippa’s viral video “How Fast Can You Count It.”  Saudi Arabia’s National Committee for Combating Drugs has grown more concerned with the popularity of the dance move as they associate it with sniffing drugs.  Even though Saudi Arabia has attracted many internationally established performers such as K-Pop stars, BTS, and 50 Cent, many artists decline invitations to perform in the country due to “human rights abuses,” says the New Arab. For example, Nicki Minaj refused to perform at the Jeddah festival to demonstrate her “support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.”

Rabat – Morocco’s chief rabbi, Yoshiyahu Pinto, praised the relationship between the Moroccan monarchy and the kingdom’s Jewish community during celebrations that drew thousands of Jews from the US, Europe, and Israel to the Muslim North African nation.   Yeshiva World News, an Orthodox Jewish online news publication, reported that the festivities began in Essaouira, Morocco, on Thursday, November 28.  Jewish pilgrims came to Morocco to celebrate Rabbi Haim Pinto, the leading rabbi of Essaouira in the early 1800s.  After praying at Rabbi Haim Pinto’s tomb, the pilgrims then held a special celebration called “Hachnasas Sefer Torah.” Following the celebration, they enjoyed a festive meal called “seudas mitzvah.” On Friday, November 29, the group moved to Casablanca. They set up a large tent next to the Grand Mogador Hotel where they held prayer and enjoyed meals for the sabbath, Judaism’s day of rest.  During the celebrations, Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto repeatedly spoke of the special relationship between King Mohammed VI and Morocco’s Jewish community.  “We respect the Kingdom, which is a kingdom of grace,” he said, according to Yeshiva World News.  Morocco’s chief rabbi added that the relationship between the Moroccan monarchy and the Jewish community has been special throughout the ages.  ‘Ex-con celebrity rabbi’ Yoshiyahu Pinto moved to Morocco in early 2017 after spending a year in prison in Israel.  An Israeli court sentenced Pinto for bribing a senior police official. After the official reported Pinto to his superior, Pinto’s followers carried out a defamation campaign against the official, according to Times of Israel. The official committed suicide in 2015 before Pinto began his prison sentence. Israeli authorities also suspected Pinto of embezzling funds from his charitable organizations but never laid charges against him. Additionally, the FBI has launched a number of investigations into Pinto’s finances since 2011. In 2012, Globes business journal named him as one of the ten wealthiest rabbis in Israel. After Pinto had lived in Morocco for two years, King Mohammed VI approved Pinto’s appointment as the country’s chief rabbi in April 2019.  Rabat: Photo, In an elaborate ceremony, Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto was crowned last tonight by representatives of the King of Morocco to become the Chief Rabbi of the Muslim State, Jewish and Muslim leaders jointly celebrated appointment pic.twitter.com/5pHwZdxgTg — Yiddish News (@YiddishNews) April 14, 2019

Rabat – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be touching down in Morocco on Wednesday, December 4, on a two-day trip that will include a visit with the King, according to a US official. In a press briefing by telephone, an official identified only as a “senior state department official” discussed Pompeo’s upcoming visit, repeatedly touting Morocco as a “critical [countering terrorism] partner.” Pompeo will arrive in Morocco on Wednesday from London, where he and President Trump are attending the NATO Leaders’ Meeting.  The secretary will meet with “a range of government officials” in Morocco on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, December 6, Pompeo will fly out of Morocco and head to Lisbon. In the November 27 telephone press briefing, the senior official previewed Pompeo’s trip with high praise for Morocco. The diplomat described Morocco as “a leader on the African continent, an important voice for peace in the broader Middle East, and a source of stability in the Mediterranean.” The official noted Morocco as a bastion of tolerance in the region. However, he also alleged that Morocco “has these quiet ties and relationship with Israel as well, as we all know,” a statement that may not be well-received by the Moroccan public. While the press statement on the visit’s objective was stereotypically vague, saying meetings would focus on the US and Morocco’s “strong economic and security partnership,” the official commented that the Western Sahara conflict would likely also be discussed as it is a priority for Morocco. The US’s policy, the official said, continues to be “that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is serious, realistic, and credible.” On resolving the conflict, the official commented that the UN-led political process is “a work in progress” and “in terms of negotiation, there is still a lot of ground to cover.” Recognizing Morocco’s efforts against terrorism, the official praised Morocco as “across the board a leader in [countering violent extremism] and bringing back foreign terrorist fighters. Just a great partner.” The official also reminded the press of Morocco being the first country to recognize the US’s independence.

Rabat – The judicial police brigade of Nador, northern Morocco, arrested a 23-year-old individual with multiple criminal records on Monday, December 2, for his alleged involvement in a case of kidnapping and rape under the threat of violence. On November 21, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) received a complaint from a 30-year-old woman accusing an unidentified person of kidnapping and rape under threat of violence. After launching an investigation, the police identified the suspect and issued a national-scale search warrant against him, said DGSN in a statement. The DGSN added that the suspect fled after committing the criminal acts. Investigations determined that the suspect was hiding in the village Jemaa Ben Tayeb in the province of Driouch, 55 kilometers southwest of Nador.  Arresting officers handed the suspect over to the Sefrou judicial police brigade for the purposes of the ongoing investigation, under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office.

Rabat – The Global Connectivity Index (GCI) for 2019 published by technology company Huawei has ranked Morocco third in Africa for 4G coverage, behind South Africa and Egypt. Despite ranking high continentally, Morocco ranked 61st globally on a list that included 79 countries. The kingdom maintained the same position as on the 2018 ranking. The index is based on 40 different indicators, including IT infrastructure, digital transformation and competitiveness, and potential growth. Morocco earned a score of 36 out of 120 points, scoring below the global average of 51.08 points. “Morocco has improved its score for 4G investment over the last year, despite its overall ranking below the global average. Along with South Africa, Morocco has some of the best 4G coverage in Africa, with 60% of the country area covered by LTE mobile technology,” says the report. “Mobile broadband subscriptions saw a 2-point improvement, as did smartphone penetration, despite broadband becoming less affordable this year. Internet usage also expanded over last year,” according to the index. The document also suggests that Morocco continues “to grow its digital infrastructure, increase online content, expand citizens’ access to broadband with an emphasis on developing digital skills, and support local service providers in developing the local IT market and building potential.” The report adds that, despite Morocco being an African leader in 4G mobile broadband with increasing numbers of subscribers able to access 4G networks, the country will not get 5G until 2022. Through its “Digital Plan 2020,” the kingdom aims to become one of the three most competitive countries in the MENA region for its IT infrastructure and business environment by 2020. The report states that South Africa has the best 4G connectivity in Africa and the 52nd globally. Egypt ranked second in the continent (58th globally), followed by Morocco and Algeria (68th). The last 10 spots of the rankings include eight other African countries. In the MENA region, Gulf countries ranked better than North African nations, with the UAE ranking 23rd globally, followed by Bahrain (40th), Oman (42nd), Saudi Arabia (43rd), and Kuwait (46th). On the global scale, the report ranks the United States first, followed by Switzerland, Sweden, Singapore, and Denmark.

Rabat – The South African minister of international relations and cooperation, Naledi Pandor, gave a speech directly questioning Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. The minister gave the public statement during a memorial event at the Algerian embassy in the South African executive capital, Pretoria, on Monday, December 2. Pandor was at the Algerian embassy for the memorial of Sghaiar Bachir, the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic’s (SADR) ambassador to Pretoria, who died last week. In her speech, Pandor attacked Morocco and its claims of territorial integrity. “In this 21st century, when many countries have gained their independence from oppressive colonialism, we still have a whole nation living in Tindouf camps, Algeria, and unable to enjoy their territorial rights,” said Pandor to a large audience. A number of diplomats, politicians, journalists, and activists attended the event. The South African official’s speech turned the meeting from a memorial into a political debate on Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. The statement from the South African foreign minister is an illustration of the volatile relations between Pretoria and Rabat. South Africa is known for its opposition to Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict, supporting the Polisario Front’s independence claims. Bilateral relations have fluctuated since 2004, when Morocco recalled its ambassador to South Africa due to Pretoria’s decision to recognize the self-proclaimed SADR. In October 2019, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa received the first Moroccan ambassador to South Africa in 15 years, Youssef Amrani. Amrani shared with Morocco World News his ambition to work on instilling Morocco’s “desire to reinforce bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.” However, based on Pandor’s speech, his mission to convince South Africa to shift its position on the Western Sahara conflict may be challenging.

Rabat – Algeria is sounding alarm bells about security risks, mostly including the kidnapping of foreign nationals, in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria. Citing a statement the Algerian government addressed to MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, Algerian news outlet TAS reported earlier today that Algiers has warned of insecurity and kidnappings risks in Tindouf. The statement from the Algerian government, TAS added, also “provided a number of measures with the aim of protecting” the UN mission in the concerned areas. Algeria is understood to have informed the MINURSO leadership that it received “information regarding preparations to kidnap foreign nationals in the refugee camps and in areas east of the [Morocco’s defense] wall.” The statement emphasized that Spanish nationals are among the primary targets of the kidnappings, confirming earlier warnings by Spain. Last week, Spain, citing “heightened instability in Northern Mali and an increase in terrorist activities in the Sahel region,” urged its citizens already in the camps to be more vigilant, while warning those who were preparing for trips to the camps during the Christmas period against travelling to the region. “This is about a real threat, confirmed by foreign secret services working in the region,” Margarita Robles, Spain’s Defense Minister—and as of last week acting Foreign Affairs Minister— said last week in a radio interview . “The risk of terror striker is imminent in these camps and we are very preoccupied by this alarming situation.” However, Polisario, the breakaway movement seeking independence in Western Sahara and running the Tindouf refugee camps, fumed at Spain for what it saw as a politically motivated move and a peddling of pro-Morocco sticking points—pointing to collusion between the Polisario and terrorist groups in the increasingly fragile Sahel region—to tarnish the group’s reputation. “Once again, the Spanish government unfortunately seeks to create ambiguity and confusion, and even paint a fabricated picture of fear and imminent danger in the Sahrawi refugee camps. It is the same government that had previously sought to compel humanitarian organizations to cease their activities in the camps and to reduce the humanitarian support provided to the refugees in consonance with the campaign led by Morocco and France,” read Polisario’s response to Spain’s security warnings. But with similar warnings coming from Algeria, known for being the most outspoken supporter of Polisario’s cause and for providing the breakaway group with military and logistical support, it remains to be seen how the Polisario leadership will respond this time around.

Rabat – Morocco has tightened restrictions on the Ceuta and Melilla border crossings by announcing their permanent closure, a move that will damage the livelihoods of the surrounding populations. Smuggling activities in the Ceuta border (Tarajal II) have been suspended since October 9, while Melilla crossing-border was closed 17 months ago. The opening of the borders was agreed upon in the Hispanic-Moroccan treaty of Fez, in 1866. It was ratified shortly after Morocco’s independence in 1956. The two enclaves form an income source for many Moroccans living in the northern cities of Tetouan, Fnideq, Nador, and the adjacent regions. Many people living in the areas surrounding the borders depend on them for carrying goods in and out of the Spanish enclave to sell. Reports suggest that the unilateral decision is final and was taken without consulting the Spanish customs office at the Morocco-Melilla border, reported Spanish E-newspaper El Confidencial. The Spanish news outlet added that the high volume of porters crossing the Tarajal II, creating blockades for hours and resulting in injuries and deaths among smugglers, prompted Rabat to prolong the border closure until the decision becomes final and irreversible. For Morocco, the illegal import of goods from Ceuta and Melilla hinders the Moroccan economy by losing large amounts of money that could be generated through paying taxation fees. In February 2019, the director-general of the Moroccan Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxation, Nabyl Lakhdar, estimated the value of the products entering Morocco through the Ceuta border between MAD 6 billion and MAD 8 billion per year (between €550 million and €730 million). The figures are ten times more than Ceuta’s legal exports to Morocco, estimated at €47 million. In terms of taxes, this is the equivalent of a loss of MAD 2 and 3 billion (between €180 and €270 million).  Lakhdar, who supports a “radical” solution to “permanently” put an end to contraband border crossings with Melilla and Ceuta, announced the figures while speaking at the Moroccan House of Representatives. He said that the prohibition of the entry of smuggled products into Morocco could be done gradually over the next 5 or 10 years. “These are amounts that the State treasury loses, and if we add Melilla’s case, the figure is doubled,” he added. Rabat’s decision will be damaging to the population’s livelihood and will increase unemployment in the economically weak northern Moroccan cities. An estimated number of 78,000 inhabitants of Fnideq in addition to 380,000 in Tetouan live through trafficking goods. On Tuesday, many people, most of them women, protested the closure of the border with Ceuta in Tetouan. Since then, internet users have been calling for a demonstration against the suspension of the portage and “the poor economic conditions in the city.” The sit-in was scheduled for Sunday morning, December 1, at the Moulay El Mehdi square. Local authorities in Tetouan banned the sit-in arguing that the protesters did not submit a request to hold the sit-in. Authorities said that the event would block the circulation in the city and disturb the public order.

 Rabat – In an act of solidarity, a large number of people from Taza, 120 kilometers east of Fez, rallied in front of the local Ibn Baja Hospital on the night of Sunday, December 1. The Tazis offered blood donations for the victims of the bus crash that killed 17 people and injured 42 on Sunday. The bus, relaying the city of Berkane, northeast Morocco, to Fez, crashed in Taza’s Bab Marzouka neighborhood. It overturned after hitting a vehicle and then flipped into a ravine. Local social media pages in Taza launched a call for blood donation because the emergency blood stocks were insufficient in Ibn Baja Hospital. The call received immediate responses from locals. Despite the cold and heavy rains, Taza inhabitants made for the hospital’s emergency department as soon as the tragic accident occurred.

Rabat – Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni and her fiance, Sudanese activist Rifaat Al Amine, officially celebrated their wedding on the evening of Saturday, November 30.  The newlyweds tied the knot in the presence of family, friends, and Morocco’s former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane. Benkirane served as prime minister of Morocco from November 2011 to March 2017. The wedding comes just weeks after Raissouni and her now-husband received a royal pardon from King Mohammed VI.  Moroccan police arrested Raissouni and Al Amine in August at the entrance of a clinic monitored for practicing illegal abortion. The Moroccan law criminalizes abortion when is not practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health. Sex outside of marriage is also a crime in Morocco, according to Article 16 of the Family Code. Both Raissouni and her fiance denied abortion claims, but the Al Akhbar al Yaoum journalist received a one-year prison sentence from the Rabat court for undergoing an illegal abortion and sex outside marriage. Her fiance received the same sentence.  King Mohammed VI granted a royal pardon to Raissouni and her fiance on October 16. The royal pardon also included the doctor and medical staff arrested for performing the alleged abortion.

Rabat – The southeastern Spanish region of Murcia may get a direct flight to Morocco if government officials are successful in convincing an airline to take up the route. The Moroccan consul-general in the region, Abdelaziz Jatim, announced that one airline “is very interested,” reported local news outlet La Opinion de Murcia. Jatim met the Spanish government delegate for the Murcia region, Francisco Jimenez, last week and thanked him for his efforts to open up a flight to Morocco.  Nearly 100,000 Moroccans live in Murcia, Jimenez said. The significant Moroccan population could be primary customers of the new flight.  Jatim said he met with officials at the Murcia Region International Airport to discuss “many possibilities” of direct routes to Morocco. The consul hinted that one company in particular was interested, saying the airline had studied the flight’s feasibility. The region’s airport, also called Corvera Airport, only opened in January 2019. All of the seven airlines using the airport are low-cost carriers, including Ryanair and TUI. Currently, the airport has flights to 20 European cities, mostly in the UK and Norway, but none to Africa. Any flight from Murcia’s Corvera airport to Morocco would have to compete for customers from existing direct flights connecting other southeastern Spanish cities to Morocco. Royal Air Maroc has direct flights from Malaga and Valencia to Casablanca, 250 and 400 kilometers away from the Murcia airport, respectively. Murcia also has more trade with Morocco than any other foreign country. Jimenez said exports to Morocco increased by over 50% from the first half of 2018 to the first half of 2019.

Rabat – The Paris Assize Court sentenced Moroccan Jihane Makhzoumi to 14 years in prison on charges of terrorism and kidnapping on Friday, November 29.  Makhzoumi appeared shocked at the terms of her sentencing, according to French news outlet Le Parisien. Her lawyers, Clemence Witt and Florian Lastelle, intend to appeal her sentence, citing a lack of psychiatric examination.  Terrorism, kidnapping, and child abandonment In August 2014, the 38-year-old Moroccan woman traveled from France to Syria with her husband, Eddy Leroux, to support the ISIS cause. The radicalized couple, who had been living in France, took a total of four children with them to join ISIS in the city of Raqqa. Only one child—the youngest of the group—was born to Makhzoumi and Leroux. Two children were born of Makhzoumi’s first marriage, and another child was born of Leroux’s first marriage.  Neither Makhzoumi or Leroux informed their former spouses of the decision to take the children to Syria. Leroux told his ex-wife that he was taking their daughter to Morocco.   Leroux, a French convert to Islam, was presumed dead in 2015. Of the four children that the couple took to Syria, only three returned to France with Makhzoumi in October 2016.  Still in Syria is an 8-year-old girl named Jana, the daughter of Leroux and his first wife, Ilham Tarbouni.  Jana’s mother firmly believes that Makhzoumi knows where the girl is and that she intentionally left Jana in Syria. In June 2015, Makhzoumi told her ex-husband through WhatsApp that she had helped someone in Syria take a child who was not hers. Investigators believe she is referring to Jana in this message.  In September 2016, shortly before she returned to France, Makhzoumi sent her ex-husband a WhatsApp message stating that “her father (Leroux) wanted her (Jana) to stay. It is the will of her father.” In her final statement at court on Friday, Makhzoumi apologized to Jana’s family, her ex-husband, and her family.  Tarbouni has been continuously appealing to the French government to take action to recover her daughter, who has been missing for three years.  In March 2019, Tarbouni’s brother traveled to Qamichli in northern Syria to search for Jana.

Rabat – COP25 has officially kicked off in Madrid, with Morocco joining more than 190 countries in the Spanish capital amid a growing sense of urgency and alarm over the human impact on the climate. In addition to government representatives, some 29,000 attendees are expected to take part in the two-week event. In a climate of rising alarm and fear as scientists make bleak predictions about the implications of human-induced climate change, the event seeks to address global and multilateral platforms to face the global climate crisis. While there is scant global action and no binding multilateral treaties to tackle the “global climate emergency,” there is robust, even overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that human impact on climate has been enormous in recent years and that “we may have crossed tipping points.” Last month, Oxford Dictionaries declared “climate emergency” the word of the year, reflecting the prominence of the global climate crisis in discussions about the future of the planet. “In 2018, climate did not feature in the top words typically used to modify emergency, instead the top types of emergencies people wrote about were health, hospital, and family emergencies,” said the selection committee of the Oxford Dictionaries. “But with climate emergency, we see something new, an extension of emergency to the global level.” Since hosting the COP22 meeting in Marrakech in 2016, Morocco has emerged as one of the few countries making “commendable” steps in adopting environmentally friendly policies. On the African continent, the North African country has repeatedly cast itself as a leader on sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. Ahead of the COP25 meeting, a coalition of 35 African countries met at Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Benguerir, north of Marrakech, to discuss “smart climate” and sustainable agriculture. Led by Morocco, the coalition spoke of its efforts as part of the broader scheme to tackle the global climate emergency. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, energy and mining minister Aziz Rabbah, Delegate Minister for Moroccans Residing Abroad Nezha El Ouafi, and Morocco’s Ambassador to Spain Karima Benyaich are representing Morocco at a COP25 summit the UN Secretary-General says should serve as a platform to devise a global response to a global issue. Speaking ahead of the Madrid meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need to make national governments more committed to climate-friendly policies. “In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments—particularly from the main emitters—to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050,” said Guterres. “We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions.” Meanwhile, for all the considerable sustainability-friendly efforts from a tiny number of governments, including Morocco, the two-week Madrid summit comes as doubts continue about the concrete significance of big political events and on-paper commitments from world governments. For critics and climate activists, it is not enough to organize huge conferences in “chic venues” to discuss ways of mitigating the global crisis or increasing world governments’ commitment to cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. “Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options. We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold,” read a recent joint article by climate activists, including Sweden’s Greta Thunberg. “Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world’s governments—the same governments that allow fossil-fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit. “Politicians and fossil-fuel companies have known about climate change for decades. And yet the politicians let the profiteers continue to exploit our planet’s resources and destroy its ecosystems in a quest for quick cash that threatens our very existence.”

Rabat – HeidelbergCement has announced the sale of around 500,000 shares, representing 3.6% of its shares in its subsidiary Ciments du Maroc for an estimated MAD 777.5 million (€73 million).  The company sold the shares to a group of Moroccan institutional investors through a block trade. The investors include banks, credit unions, insurance companies, pensions, investment advisors, endowments, and mutual funds among others. Following the transaction, HeidelbergCement will retain a controlling stake of 51% in its material building company and continue to fully support the subsidiary as part of its umbrella company. “HeidelbergCement is fully committed to remaining the long-term majority shareholder of Ciments du Maroc, a key strategic asset within the Group’s portfolio,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, the chairman of the cement giant’s board.  “The further reduction in shareholding is part of our action plan to optimize our portfolio and generate cash in order to speed up deleveraging. We continue to be well on track to reach our target of €1.5 billion of disposal proceeds by the end of 2020,” Scheifele added. Ciment du Maroc is Morocco’s second-biggest cement producer and the leading operator in ready-mix concrete and aggregates. LafargeHolcim Maroc is the country’s largest cement producer. In the third quarter of 2019, the Moroccan leader in the production and marketing of cement and building materials, LafargeHolcim, achieved MAD 1.9 billion (€178.08 million) in revenue, a drop of 1% compared to the same period in 2018. Meanwhile, in the first quarter of 2019, Ciment du Maroc attained a turnover of MAD 2.04 billion (€191.2 million) compared to MAD 1.95 billion (€182.76 million) in the same period the year before The upward trend in revenue is linked to the growth in cement sales by volume of 0.9% and an increase in sales of clinker by 55.3%. The growth is owed in particular to an increase in exports, according to Ciment du Maroc’s financial reporting.

Rabat – Morocco’s Zakaria Labyad, playing football for Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, will not be able to resume training until mid-2020, at the earliest, due to a knee injury. Ajax’s coach, Erik Ten Hag, made the announcement on Sunday, December 1, following his team’s win 5-2 against Twente in the local league. “Labyad won’t play again neither in 2019 nor a large part of 2020,” said Ten Hag at a press conference. The 26-year-old Moroccan-Dutch player injured his right knee during his team’s game against French club Lille during the European Champions League group stage. The medical staff transported Labyad off the field in the 47th minute of the game. Ten Hag did not give more details on Labyad’s injury. Since the start of the season, Labyad has mostly played as a substitute. However, in recent weeks, Ajax’s coach decided to start giving him more opportunities in the starting squad. In two games when Labyad was a starting player, the Moroccan athlete scored one goal and gave one assist. However, the injury will put his development as a player on hold. Labyad was born and grew up in the Netherlands. While the attacking midfielder played for the U17 Dutch national team, he decided to switch his athletic allegiance to Morocco. Between 2011 and 2016, Labyad played 17 games for Morocco’s U23 national team, scoring seven goals. He also played six games with the Atlas Lions. The Moroccan player started his senior career with Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. He then played for Portuguese club Sporting Lisboa and English club Fulham, before coming back to the Netherlands to play for Utrecht and then Ajax.

Rabat – Moroccan police have arrested Moroccan YouTuber Mohammed Sekkaki, known as Moul Kaskita, for publishing a video on his channel that contains “insults to Moroccan citizens and public institutions,” according to the attorney general at Settat’s Court of First Instance. The arrest took place on Saturday, November 30, only one day after the YouTuber posted his video online. The charges include using degrading terms towards the Moroccan people and their dignity and expressing prejudice against public institutions. Moul Kaskita was also carrying a small quantity of drugs at the time of the arrest, according to the attorney general. While the video that led to Sekkaki’s arrest disappeared from his channel on Tuesday, December 2, there are many re-uploads on several online channels. In the 12-minute-long video, Sekkaki speaks to the camera criticizing Morocco, its people, government, and King. The segment that prompted the arrest is one where he calls Moroccan people “stupid,” according to the attorney general. “Moroccan people are stupid and uneducated. Moroccans only care about buttocks. Moroccans do not know how to vote because they are ignorant,” said the YouTuber. Sekkaki referenced certain YouTube videos about body enhancement trending in Morocco. The insults targeting Moroccan people came after Sekkaki criticized the government and accused its members of corruption. According to him, Moroccan people are culpable, too, because “they do not vote for qualified people to represent them.” While the YouTuber tackles issues that are already in the public eye, his language is considered derogatory. In other segments of the video, the YouTuber also criticized the King and his speeches, qualifying them as useless. He even parodied one of the King’s speeches, saying that the King does not even know what he is reading, as other people prepare the speeches for him. At the end of the video, Sekkaki predicts his arrest, stating that he is “not scared, because [he] is only telling facts.” This is not the first time that police have arrested Sekkaki. In January 2017, the YouTuber faced charges of scamming and “sextortion” and spent several months in prison. A few weeks after getting out of prison, in October 2018, police arrested the YouTuber again for charges including organizing an unauthorized demonstration, incitement to commit a misdemeanor, and insulting officials on duty. The “Moul Kaskita” channel counts more than 330,000 subscribers and has more than 64 million video views. It started in 2012 as a channel for comedy, satire, and entertainment. However, in recent months, the videos posted became podcasts addressing issues of public interest in Morocco and other viral topics. While social media is increasingly used across the world to address socio-economic issues and suggest solutions, many Moroccan “influencers” have, according to authorities, taken freedom of speech too far and offended others. On November 25, the Court of First Instance in Sale sentenced Moroccan rapper Mohamed Mounir, known as Gnawi, to one year in prison. The rapper insulted Moroccan security services in a social media video one month prior to his conviction.

Rabat – Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, the president of Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), has decried the lack of cooperation of a number of Moroccan ministers and other high-ranking public administration officials, condemning their unwillingness to share data on their respective departments’ performances. As the main provider of economic, demographic, and statistical data on Morocco, HCP prides itself on its independence and the fact all departments of Morocco’s public administration have the obligation to share their data with the institution. In statements reported by Moroccan newspaper Assabah on December 2, Alami lambasted a number of high-ranking public officials for “refusing to share information they have at their disposal” for a study HCP did recently. “This is completely unacceptable behavior, especially coming from government and administrative officials,” complained the HCP president. Among the reported non-cooperative officials is Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s minister for trade, industry, and new technologies. Elalamy’s ministry reportedly refused to share data on a report that a department at the ministry had done. In his tirade against allegedly uncooperative government officials, the HCP president is also said to have warned against mis-using or misquoting HCP studies or statistics. Alami was referring to recent instances when there was notable discrepancy between HCP’s statistical data on Morocco’s economic performance and the interpretation some public officials made of the figures. In most cases, when HCP’s figures showed a grim picture of a given sector, government interpretation would paint a much more encouraging, half decent picture of the same sector. One recent example involved what some observers called a “battle of figures” between HCP and the trade and investment ministry. In that particular case, HCP’s data on employment in Morocco, which offered a grim reading of the Moroccan labor market, was the exact opposite of the government’s “lofty” figures and its insistence on delivering a target number of employments HCP rightly predicted it could not attain. Alami argued that such practices—both withholding information from HCP and misquoting its data—would be “contrary to the royal will,” with King Mohammed VI having made it consistently clear that all government departments should cooperate with HCP in its mission of conceiving updated and accurate data on Morocco’s economic and political trajectories. Meanwhile, there have also been instances in recent months when HCP’s figures clashed with those of other respectable Moroccan and international institutions, including Morocco’s central bank (Bank Al-Maghrib), the Moroccan Ministry of Finance and Economy, the IMF, and the World Bank. In HCP’s defense, Lahlimi said that institutions like the IMF and the World Bank make “approximative predictions” on Morocco since their database is not regularly updated, whereas  HCP’s data is “constantly updated” and therefore “more accurate” and reflective of Morocco’s progress.

Rabat – Tangier’s cruise tourism development strategy has yielded positive results, with a 14.3% increase in cruise ship stopovers at the city’s port between 2018 and 2019. The Tangier City Port Management Company (SGPTV) predicts a 16% increase in 2020.  The strategy aims to present Tangier, Morocco as a flagship destination for cruise tourism on an international scale.  Since undertaking the strategy, the Tangier City Port has improved its reputation among shipowners who note the Moroccan port’s excellent hospitality and service during stopovers, according to SGPTV.  The Tangier City Port is committed to the cruise industry, the source added. The port shows its commitment through membership to the two main cruise ship associations, CLIA and MedCruise.  Cruise tourism is a consistently growing industry, with more than 30 million travelers selecting this vacation package in 2019.  The port authorities of Tangier, Morocco; Malaga, Spain; and Tenerife in the Canary Islands are set to sign an agreement today, December 2, that aims to develop cruise tourism in the region. The three port cities will work together to promote new cruise routes in the region and increase stopovers in their respective ports.  SGTPV added that the positive socio-economic impact that cruise tourism could bring to the Tangier and southern Spain regions is a driving force behind the commercial partnership.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Meteorological Directorate (DMN) has announced in a special weather report that the country will get snow and heavy rain worthy of an orange alert from December 2 to 4, Monday to Wednesday. The High Atlas Mountains and the Middle Atlas Mountains will receive heavy snowfall at locations with an altitude of 1,500 meters above sea level or higher. The DMN revised an earlier prediction in the state-owned news service Maghreb Arab Press that assessed the snow as falling only at an altitude of 1,700 meters and higher. Residents in Al Haouz, Azilal, Beni Mellal, Errachidia, Midelt, Boulemane, and Tinghir will get “orange alert” levels of snow on Monday and Tuesday. Ifrane, Sefrou, and Khenifra can expect snow on Tuesday. The snow could turn to rain in some regions, however, as the weather service also predicted Errachidia and Tinghir would get rain overnight Monday. The region surrounding the capital, Rabat, will receive heavy rainfall worthy of an orange alert from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday. The area around Tetouan in the north will also receive a deluge of rain from 12 noon on Monday until 3 a.m. Tuesday. Heavy rain will start again in much of the northern part of the country—Chefchaouen, Al Hoceima, Driouch, Nador, Rabat, Tetouan, Berkane, Guercif, Taourirt, Oujda, Jerada, Sefrou, and Larache—at 9 a.m. on Tuesday and continue until 3 a.m. Wednesday, December 4. Moroccans in the south will see cloudy skies, and those on the coast north of Tarfaya in Western Sahara may also get rain showers.  Along Morocco’s Atlantic coast, fishermen and sailors can expect rough seas. The Atlas reliefs will have the coldest temperature lows in the country at 0 to 5 degrees Celsius. The warmest highs will come in the southern provinces at 25 to 32 degrees Celsius.

Rabat – The Spanish child protection agency operating in the city of Ceuta has convinced 30 unaccompanied Moroccan minors to return to Morocco while placing 38 in the La Esperanza shelter. In a report sharing official data on the number of unaccompanied minors living on the streets of Ceuta, the city’s government has said that it has managed to save 30% of the 229 unaccompanied foreign minors (MENA) from the streets. The percentage represents 68 minors. The child protection operation took place over 15 months as part of a program launched in partnership with the University of Malaga, reported Spanish International news agency EFE on Friday, September 29. The Spanish child protection agency, the Department for Minors in the Autonomous City of Ceuta, presented for the first time a report on the number of unaccompanied foreign minors living on the streets of Ceuta.  According to calculations, Spanish officials pointed out that the number of foreign minors usually ranges between 45 and 50 in Ceuta’s port. The coordinator of the project, Elisa Garcia, a full professor of Criminal Law and Criminology at the University of Malaga has highlighted the need for “the child protection system to take to the streets.”  Garcia’s remark suggests that the agency needs to do more fieldwork to identify more unaccompanied foreign minors in order to save them from the streets.

Rabat – How did Morocco and Algeria, once tied together under the banner of Islam, develop so differently to the point that the two now consider themselves bitter rivals? Before the era of French colonialism, the Greater Maghreb was a consolidated cultural entity, with a shared dialect of Arabic, similar Arab-Amazigh (Berber) ethnic roots, and, obviously, a strong sense of cultural identity. However, the different states found today in the Maghreb could not differ more in terms of political structure. Consider the two powers in the region: Morocco and Algeria. Morocco is a parliamentary, constitutional monarchy that, despite continuous human rights abuses by the state, has in fact achieved a level of liberalization that is unparalleled in the Arab World—except maybe by Tunisia. Algeria, on the other hand, is a shambling husk of a state, exhausted from decades of violence, a dependency on oil, and the complete fracturing of society along neo-tribal lines. In addition, Moroccan-Algerian relations since the independence era can be characterized by tense, antagonistic exchanges broken only ever so often by all-out conflict, such as the Sand War of 1963, or during the Western Sahara War of 1975-1991.  How did the two countries, united within the Arab Muslim world due to their similar Amazigh roots and Darija dialect, develop in such different ways, even to the point where the two are now rivals in the contest for North African hegemony? This is, somehow, in large part due to the different styles of colonialism practiced in each country. This cannot explain away all of the differences, however, and to find the other piece of the puzzle, one must turn to some of the state-crafting techniques utilized by resistance movements in both countries during the struggle for independence and the post-independence period. Morocco’s state-crafting process was focused on unification—starting with the Tangier Speech of 1947—while Algeria’s process was characterized by different factions vying for power, something that has permeated the political culture of Algeria and still exists today. To discuss the process of state-crafting in Morocco, it is important to understand a major advantage Morocco possessed over Algeria in terms of stability during the transitional period. France’s “protectorate” approach to colonialism in Morocco essentially kept Moroccan society intact. Instead of removing the monarch from power completely, which could possibly cause massive revolts, the French instead kept the monarchy alive. This means that during the independence and post-independence eras, there was no question as to who was going to take the reins of the newly free state. Power was simply to return to the monarch. Additionally, the protectorate system also preserved the Moroccan identity, to a certain extent. While Morocco would have to consider its future relationships with Europe and what role the French language would play in Morocco, there was still an underlying consensus of what being “Moroccan” meant. Compare this with Algeria, where a period of brutal colonialism and subjugation had left the people unsure about the Algerian identity altogether. These two characteristics—an idea of what it meant to be Moroccan, known locally as “tamaghrabit,” plus a clear-cut ruler to lead Morocco into the age of independence—contributed to the stability of Morocco. The absence of these characteristics in Algeria also explain why the converse is true of the Algerian state right now. But to assume that the Moroccan monarch always held such sway over the Moroccan populace is blatantly incorrect. In fact, several accounts of public perception of the Moroccan King from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were overwhelmingly negative. Cities, upon hearing of the arrival of the King, often “fled to other regions; and the Sultan often passed through a deserted country, except that the Governor and tribal representative had to be there to pour the little wealth of the countryside into the royal coffers,” wrote Walter Harris in his 1921 book “Morocco That Was.” Another interesting point against the unity of the Moroccan people under the banner of the monarchy is the existence of the Rif Republic, from 1921-1925. The existence of Abd Al-Karim’s localized republic provides strong evidence that support for the King was not necessarily widespread until at least after the 1920s. It was not until 1947, when King Mohammed V gave the Tangier Speech that he cemented the position of the monarch as an important symbol of Moroccan unity and as the proprietor of a unified push for nationalism. Using truly amazing rhetoric, Mohammed V united his people with incendiary words, such as, “We have become alienated from our sacred rights due to our ignorance, and the unity of our country is torn apart because of the mistakes we have made in this regard.” He also referenced the Islamic traditions that define Morocco. By affirming his own rule through the common Islamic root that all Moroccans share, he not only drew the people together under the banner of one religion but also drew attention back to the source of his own legitimacy: The Alaouite bloodline. Not only did the Tangier Speech bring together Moroccans under the banner of Islam, it united the different nationalist causes through Islamic motivation—not being Arab, not Moroccan nationality, but Islam as the one true underlying connection all Moroccans share. He thus brought them together in support of a monarch that drew his legitimacy from the bloodline of the prophet, as Abdelhai Azarkan noted in his article “Statecraft and sovereignty in Mohammed V of Morocco’s Tangiers Speech (1947).” The French retaliated by promptly exiling the King, which only strengthened the dedication and loyalty of the Moroccan people to the deposed monarch. The Tangier Speech marks the beginning of what would become a successful independence movement with overwhelming support from every sector of Moroccan society and should be considered the most important act of statecraft during the independence movement in Morocco. In the aftermath of the colonial era, Algeria did not have the same monarchical legacy Morocco had from which she could build a nation with a legitimate form of sovereignty. Additionally, the various Algerian independence movements had not consolidated themselves under one concept other than opposition to the French as a whole. Where the King in Morocco had successfully rallied both Islamists and nationalists alike by positioning himself as an Islamic ruler who stood for all of Morocco, Algeria quickly fell into a period of political infighting that was almost comparable with the era of colonialism itself. The leaders of the revolution bickered amongst themselves in attempts to hold onto power, and Ben Bella established himself not as a leader with the intent of growing Algeria into a functioning nation but rather as a dictator. In response to escalating political threats surrounding him, Ben Bella tried more and more fervently to retain his slipping grasp on the country. The idea of legitimated political violence that had helped Algeria fight the war of independence had quickly been adapted into the political landscape and was used more in practice than actual pluralism. The National Liberation Front (FLN) party believed that as the harbingers of the revolution, it was their right and their right alone to control the future of Algeria, John Reudy explained in his book “Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation.” As if these two terrible additions to the Algerian political status quo were not debilitating enough, another fatal flaw came from the socialist policies of the 1960s and 1970s. In order to pacify the people, the government began to subsidize nearly everything. While this did in fact kept the masses at bay, it also had two profound impacts on the economy of Algeria. First, farmers stopped working the fields, because the socialist government handed out paychecks incongruent to the levels of production. Algeria, for the first time ever, had to begin importing food to feed its own people, Ray Takeyh wrote in his paper on Islamism in Algeria. Secondly, and more sociologically, it made the people unaccustomed to the idea of working and crippled any future efforts to wean the system away from oil profits. During Bendjedid’s presidency, as oil prices dropped, Bendjedid worked to liberalize the economy of Algeria. Suddenly, people found themselves less provided for by the government than in years past, only adding to the continuously worsening state of affairs in Algeria. Another nail in the metaphorical coffin of Algeria’s post-independence state of affairs was their complete dedication to non-alignment. While Algeria did open up in some way to the USSR, for the most part, they viewed any interaction with the outside world (or rather, with the West, from where most economic opportunities would have come) as a revitalized colonialism, and so they cut off their economic ties. Without foreign investment, Algeria essentially cut itself off from all of the luxury goods they had seen during the period of French colonialism, pushing the people even further into disenfranchisement. The path to liberalization that lies before Morocco is a long one indeed. Yet, when we compare the state of Morocco to the state of Algeria, we see just how critical the authority of the monarchy has been to the development of civil societies and the general liberalization of political affairs in Morocco. Without a strong authority figure, it’s not inconceivable that Morocco would be where Algeria is today. Although Algeria and Morocco had opposed trajectories since independence, the people of the two countries have always been bound by a strong feeling of togetherness and brotherhood. Realizing the strength of this feeling, the late Algerian President Boumedienne (1965-1978), after throwing his support behind the Polisario Front that is fighting for the independence and self-determination of the Western Sahara, called for the establishment of the “Maghreb of the People” which from the start looked like a vacuous political initiative to offset the enmity created by the Western Sahara issue. However, in spite of these political hurdles, the Algerian people continued to visit Morocco in thousands to buy Western consumer goods and enjoy creature comforts not available in their beleaguered socialist country in spite of the undeclared reprehension of their government. However, following a terrorist attack in a hotel in Marrakech in 1994, masterminded by Franco-Algerian terrorists, Morocco temporarily imposed visa restrictions on Algerian citizens. The Algerian government, in reprisal, closed off the land border with Morocco to stem mass Algerian tourism. The border is still sealed off today to disallow the Moroccan treasury from making up to $3 billion in tourist revenues, according to Algerian sources. Since February 16, 2019, the Algerian masses have taken to the streets to force the military to relinquish power and go back to their barracks. This peaceful uprising known as the Smile Revolution, or Hirak, is yet another manifestation of the Arab Spring of 2011 whereby the people want real democracy and political self-determination after decades of military dictatorship. The uprising has gained momentum over the months and pushed the army to make several concessions but not to give up power. Nevertheless, the popular revolution will ultimately achieve its aims, in the long run, because the government is on the verge of economic and political bankruptcy: The sovereign fund is depleted, and the government is resorting to massive printing of paper money to pay functionaries. The subsidies have been abolished and if people cannot have free bread, they will want a promising democracy. In the long run this Hirak will change the face of Algeria, have positive implications on Morocco, and allow the realization of the Great Maghreb and make of it an economic powerhouse in this part of the African continent that is aspiring for real change and positive prospects. Consequently, Algeria will achieve democracy and the rule of law and open its doors for investors and regional and world capital. The change of heart of Algeria will greatly benefit Morocco economically by allowing Moroccan businesses to enter the lucrative market of 40 million avid consumers and politically by rubbing off the sentiment of democracy on stable Morocco to trigger, once and for all, incremental democracy that will lead to full democracy and real constitutional monarchy. Real democracy in Algeria will undoubtedly benefit, also, the limping democracy in Tunisia and cause the political tribes of Libya to reunite and re-establish a civilian state based on power-sharing and political responsibility. The Algerian Hirak might also unite the people of the Maghreb and make it truly great to become an important partner of Europe and America and a viable actor in the Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East, not to forget, of course, Black Africa, replete with economic opportunities. A unified Great Maghreb can become a force of stability in Africa and the Mediterranean by stopping irregular immigration, a source of problems for Europe and the West and by fighting, in unison, violent religious extremism thriving in the great expanses of the Sahara and inspiring such deadly movements as Boko Haram in Black Africa. A democratic Maghreb can also stem at home such painful headaches as corruption, nepotism, embezzlement, abuse of power, gender inequality, and money laundering. Hopefully, the Algerian uprising will activate full democracy and economic development in the region but also equity and equality by recognizing fully all ethnic and religious groups of the region be they Arab, Amazigh, Jewish, African, Christian or other minorities whatever they might be. Algeria and Morocco, long opposed by ideology will, God willing, become responsible partners in democracy that will pull the Great Maghreb out of the actual quagmire into an era of wellbeing and togetherness. Is this possible and feasible? Only time will show…. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – Today, December 1, marks the World AIDS Day, an international day dedicated to raising awareness about the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by the spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In Morocco, around 21,000 adults are living with HIV, according to 2018 statistics from the UN Programme for HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS). However, around 30% of Moroccans infected by HIV do not even know their HIV positive status. While the number of Moroccans living with HIV represents only 0.08% of the general population, the disease is prevalent in key populations such as people who inject drugs, with a prevalence of 7.9%; gay men (5.7%), sex workers (1.3%), and prisoners (0.5%). In 2018, the Moroccan Association for the Fight against AIDS (ALCS) recorded 900 new HIV infections and 350 deaths among Moroccans. The organization recorded around 67% of the new cases of HIV infection in the key populations where AIDS is prevalent, while 70% of women among the new cases received the infection through their husbands. The regions of Souss-Massa, Marrakech-Safi, and Casablanca-Settat host 65% of Moroccans living with HIV. The cities where the disease is most prevalent are Nador, with a prevalence of 13.2%, Casablanca (9%), Tetouan (7.1%), and Marrakech (5.7%). The number of new AIDS cases in Morocco is declining every year. Since 2010, new HIV infections have decreased by 2% and AIDS-related deaths have decreased by 42%. Morocco is undertaking a national plan to increase awareness of AIDS and prevent new infections. In 2012, HIV testing became integrated into health centres across the country, and treatment became more accessible. “Morocco is a model for other countries and will reach the 90-90-90 targets by 2020. It is important to be optimistic; I am an incorrigible optimist,” commented UNAIDS Executive Director, Michel Sidibe, hinting at Morocco’s progress in the fight against AIDS. The 90-90-90 targets are an HIV awareness-raising platform set by UNAIDS. Its goal is to have, by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV know their HIV positive status and receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. Meanwhile, 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will be administered viral suppression. Civil society is also an important actor in raising awareness about AIDS in Morocco. ALCS’ president Hakima Kimmich said that civil society is “on track and must not relax efforts in prevention and access to treatment to, why not, succeed in ending the epidemic in [Morocco] by 2030.”

Rabat – Morocco has signed a memorandum with Germany for the setting up of a “reform partnership,” in the form of a contribution from Germany within the framework of the G20 Initiative “Compact with Africa.”  The Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, and German Development Minister Gerd Müller signed the memorandum on Friday, November 30. The reform partnership is in line with plans announced at the G20 Investment Summit in Berlin. The German-African Business Association and the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of German Business (SAFRI) organized the conference. The Compact with Africa (CWA) was initiated under the German G20 Presidency to promote private investment in Africa. Its primary objective is to increase the attractiveness of private investment. Germany supports African countries that have improved their general environment, in terms of good governance, development of tax authorities and supreme audit institutions, legal certainty, anti-corruption, and democracy. Under the partnership, Germany will provide €571 million over the period of 2020-2022 to support the implementation of the reforms that Morocco has undertaken.  The reforms involve improving the country’s business and investment climate and financial sector, as well as strengthening advanced regionalization. They aim to further develop the potential of the private sector and promote sustainable economic growth. The program focuses in particular on facilitating access to financing and improving the framework conditions for the support and development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, in order to turn them into a real lever for economic and social inclusion, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – The 2019-2020 national plan for the fight against cold waves will cover more than 736,000 Moroccans living in 1,753 remote villages, dispersed over 27 different provinces. Morocco’s Minister of Interior, Abdelouafi Laftit, presented the numbers in front of the Moroccan Parliament’s House of Councillors on Wednesday, November 27. The Ministry of Interior established the plan in 2007 to assist populations affected by cold waves. The plan includes supplying the target villages with commodities, heating, and livestock feed, as well as linking them to telecommunication systems. The plan also ensures the intervention of Royal Gendarmerie’s rescue helicopters to help people in cases of emergency, such as women giving birth. The aim of these emergency interventions is to provide health care, especially in areas where no health facilities are available, Laftit explained. Also included in the vision, according to the minister, is the deployment of medical units of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces in the towns of Azilal and Midelt, a mobile hospital in the town of Imilchil (central Morocco), as well as medical caravans and field visits to all the target villages. Pregnant women, elderly people, and people suffering from chronic diseases living in remote villages will receive medical monitoring thanks to the plan, added the minister. So far, authorities, in collaboration with civil society, have distributed food and blankets to shelters, students dormitories, boarding schools, hospitals, health centres, and orphanages in a number of the target villages. The plan comes as Morocco expects a wave of mild and heavy snowfall in a number of provinces in the coming weeks. On November 30, Morocco’s National Meteorological Directorate predicted a wave of cold weather and mild snowfall in several provinces around the country on December 2-3. Morocco has a mixed experience with snowfall and the ensuing strong weather. While cold waves increase tourism in snowy provinces such as Ifrane, remote villages in mountainous areas suffer from the lack of infrastructures, as roads can remain blocked by the snow for several weeks. In line with this year’s national plan to mitigate the negative effects of the cold wave, local authorities in remote villages have also arranged landing pads for helicopters in case of emergencies, added Laftit. The plan is an inter-ministerial effort, with the High Commission for Water and Forests distributing firewood, the Ministry of Agriculture subsidizing livestock feed, and the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics mobilizing snow removal equipment to open regional and provincial roads.

Chebakia is a mouthwatering Moroccan pastry made from strips of spiced dough, deep fried, and then dipped in honey and covered in toasted sesame seeds. If you have never tasted it before, make today the day that you do. I promise, it is worth it.  Chebakia’s chewy, crunchy texture makes it a favorite throughout the year but it is most often enjoyed during Ramadan. No Moroccan iftaar (meal to break the fast) table is complete without a tray of honey-soaked chebakia, harira, and dates. In winter months many families enjoy chebakia in the evening with a warming bowl of harira. It is also popular as an accompaniment to Moroccan mint tea as an afternoon snack or when welcoming guests.  Because of its rich ingredients and sweet taste, Chebakia provides enough energy for people who have spent the whole day from dawn to sunset fasting. It is one of the basic honeyed cookies on the daily Ramadan tables, as well as Harira, dates and bread.   Once you’ve tasted chebakia there is no going back. It is as addictive as it is delicious. Today I will show you how can feed your new found addiction in any country, from any kitchen. It is quite a lengthy process, but well worth the effort. Here is what you will need: 1kg of white flour 125 grams of ground toasted sesame seeds 125 grams of ground almonds 1 tablespoon of ground anise seeds 1 tablespoon of ground fennel seeds 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon 1 of teaspoon sugar A pinch of salt 1 teaspoon of baking powder ¼ teaspoon of baking yeast Some saffron threads 1 egg yolk 180ml of oil (half of vegetable oil and half of olive oil) 180ml of melted butter (about 125 grams) 80ml of white vinegar. 200ml of orange blossom Some gum arabica pebbles (ground with some sugar) Oil for frying (about two liters) For garnish: 2kg of honey ½ cup of toasted sesame seeds Now it is time to start cooking: First, sift all the dry ingredients (flour, almonds, sesame, fennel, and anis seeds) into a large bowl and mix well. In a pan, mix in the orange blossom, vinegar, and saffron and heat the mixture to warm gently, do not boil. Add the melted butter, oil, egg yolk, and the mixture of orange blossom and vinegar to the dry ingredients. Mix with your hands until all the ingredients are combined well, add some water if needed, the dough should be soft and cohesive. It is not necessary to knead the dough. Divide the dough into 5 equal portions. Cover the portions with a plastic wrap so that the dough will be softer and easier to roll. On a working surface, flatten a portion of the dough with a rolling pin into a thin layer. Cut into medium squares using a cutter. (A special mold is available in Moroccan stores that can make this work easier). Cut i4 parallel lines into each square, leaving the edges intact.  Lift three alternate strips up and leave the other two down, then try to join the two opposing angles to succeed to form a flower. Repeat the process until you have used all the dough. Heat the oil in a deep pan on a medium heat, then lower the heat to make sure you do not burn the chebakia. Fry the Chebakia in very hot oil until it becomes golden brown. While the chebakia is cooking heat honey in a pan and add two tablespoons of orange blossom. Soak the chebakia in the honey, leave it for a while to make sure the honey soaks in well. Remove the excess honey by letting it drip off the chebakia in a strainer and sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the sticky cookies. Keep the chebakia in a plastic container in a cool and dry place, or in the fridge. Enjoy at any time of day and try to share!

Rabat – An Israeli man died after two buses crushed him in Casablanca on Friday, November 29, reported Israeli media. According to reports, the man was crossing a street in front of the hotel where he stayed when a bus suddenly accelerated and hit him. The victim was identified as 41-year-old David Levy. Levy, who served as a rabbi, had come to Casablanca with a group of Israelis for a memorial ceremony. The incident injured a second Israeli man, but emergency services intervened quickly and carried him to a hospital. Israeli media speculated that the tragic incident may have been due to anti-semitic feelings. “People shouted that it was a terrorist attack. It was a big panic, and it didn’t look like a car accident,” an Israeli bystander told Israeli Channel 12. Police arrested two bus drivers for investigation and haven’t determined the nature of the incident yet. The driver, however, explained that he hit the gas pedal by mistake and that it was an “unfortunate accident.” Moroccan authorities are yet to comment on the incident and address speculations.

Rabat – Sellou is an unbaked authentic Moroccan dish. Also known as zmita and seffouf, it is a combination of luxurious and flavorful ingredients including nuts, toasted sesame, sugar and roasted flour as the main ingredients. Like many traditional recipes, the ingredients vary from region to region. While sellou is a traditional element of the Moroccan iftaar (meal to break the fast) during Ramadan, families serve it throughout the year at celebrations and ceremonies. Sellou is also a treat served at Moroccan birth celebrations.  Made mostly from dry ingredients, sellou lasts for a long time if kept covered. We eat sellou with a spoon from a shared dish accompanied by hot tea or a cup of coffee.  Today I will show you how to make a small batch of sellou to enjoy at home or share with friends and family.  1kg of white flour 500 grams of sesame seeds 500 grams of  almonds 500 grams of peanuts 2 tablespoons of anise seeds 2 tablespoons of fennel seeds 1 tablespoon cinnamon 200 grams of icing sugar  125 grams of butter 1 liter of vegetable oil ½ cup of honey ½ teaspoon of salt ½ teaspoon of ground gum arabica(optional) Spread the flour over a large baking sheet and place it in a preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the flour is a light golden brown color. Keep checking and stirring to prevent the flour from burning. When the flour is cool sift it to remove any balls and put it aside. Next, toast the sesame seeds in the oven for 10 min or on the stove over medium heat. Take a half cup of sesame and put it aside, then grind finely the rest in a blender. Now, boil almonds for 2 minutes, drain and peel them. Once peeled, dry fry the almonds in a pan over low heat until they are golden brown.  Take a half cup of fried almonds and put it aside. Now finely grind the rest of almonds. Roast the peanuts in the oven for 15 minutes until its color becomes light golden, then finely grind them. Toast the anise and fennel seeds and grind them well, then sift get a smooth powder. Melt the butter over low heat in a pot until the milk solids separate to the bottom of the pot. Place the pot in the refrigerator for an hour or more. The butter will be hard, and the milk solids can be poured off.  Heat the oil and let it cool for a while. In large bowl put the sifted brown flour, ground sesame, ground almonds, ground peanuts, anise and fennel seeds, cinnamon,gum arabica, salt and sifted icing sugar then mix well. Add the melted butter and the heated oil slowly and mix using your hands or a spatula then add honey and mix again for a while. Knead the sellou for a few minutes to ensure everything is mixed thoroughly.  Finally, before transferring to a plastic container leave the sellou in the large bowl overnight. Now serve the sellou with tea or coffee and try not to eat it all yourself!
