Rabat – Moulay Hicham shared a statement on Twitter in which he criticized the sentence given by Casablanca’s Court of Appeal on Friday night. Bouachrine received a sentence of 12 years in prison. “We are deeply saddened about the absence of a fair trial in the case of journalist Taoufik Bouachrine,” the prince said. He added that the lack of a “fair trial “missed an opportunity to establish truth in a judicial case that was mainly intended to protect Moroccan women.”
 Bouachrine was arrested in February after several women journalists filed complaints against him for “sexual harassment, assault, human trafficking, attempted rape, and  rape.”
 Prince Moulay Hicham said that the absence of a fair trial in this case and the lack of “testimony [by] national and international human rights organizations, which are known for their credibility, lead automatically to the conclusion that there are national and Arab political motives behind the prosecution of a journalist, who was a nuisance because of his writings.”
 The prince also questioned press freedom in the country, saying that the target, in this case, is “freedom of expression and independent press.” For  Moulay Hicham, Bouachrine’s case is “a new episode of an ongoing series” wherein we witness the “targeting [of] news outlets and journalists.” He added that some of those journalists who were jailed or exiled include Abou Baker El Jamii, Ali El Merabet, Ali Anzoula, Hamid El Mahdaoui, and others. Moulay Hicham also criticized Morocco’s development model. He said that the recent cases come against the backdrop of the state’s admission that its development model has “failed.” “with the state acknowledgment of its failed development model.”

Rabat – Yet, again, without its massive intervention during WWII with men, armor and funds Germany would have conquered Europe. American generosity and humanity put forward the Marshall Plan in 1948 (Foreign Assistance Act of 1948) and without it  Europe would not be what it is today, a power to reckon with.  But when the billionaire businessman Trump went on the presidential elections campaign trail, he surely invoked making America great again, but it was already great with its political ideals, its technological advance, and human solidarity. For Trump “making America great” again was only a pretext for his “making America first” whereby “first,” here, rhymes with “selfish” and if one is selfish, he can, in no way, be a role model for the rest of the world. A leader by definition is a tolerant, generous, loving and brave individual. Someone who thinks about the others more than he does about himself. This was America until Trump came to power through the democratic process, of course. Trump, a successful businessman, wants to turn America into America Inc. A country that makes money left and right and shuns anything that does not bring green bucks. He wants to turn his country into a big company, but what if this company does not make money will it go bust and disappear? A country is a land, people, languages, culture, feeling, ideals that are not money-making concepts, but a supreme philosophy. He does not want immigration because as a good WASP that he is, he is scared, to death, that the white race loses its supremacy in the near future, but America was always multi-colored and that is what makes its strength and greatness.  At the entrance of the New York harbor there is a proud lady holding a torch of American greatness, welcoming migrants, wayfarers of all colors creeds and idioms, but since Trump arrived to the White House she is wandering what, on earth, is she doing there? When the white Europeans came to America in the 15th century, the Native Americans did not chase them; on the contrary, they gave them food and welcomed them. But, as more whites came in and moved west, they grabbed the territories of the Indians and pushed them into reserves when they did not massacre them or made them addicted to alcohol, on purpose. Trump wants to build a massive wall to keep Mexicans from migrating into America, but the strong American economy needs the cheap Mexican labor and the Mexicans need the little money they make in the US to feed their families back home. Trump in his business drive does not like free-riders. Indeed, right after his election he travelled to the Gulf States and made them pay for American protection billions of dollars. He, also, made a very undiplomatic move, recently, when he said publicly that the Al-Saud household, in power in Saudi Arabia, will not last two weeks without American protection. Did he say that to put pressure on the Saudis to increase their oil output on the eve of the American oil sanctions on Iran, or to show American power? He, also, wants Europeans to pay for the American nuclear umbrella and when, recently, Macron and Merkel spoke of creating a European army he did not like the idea, in the least. So, in many ways Trump seems to want his cake and to eat, too, as the saying goes. Destroying America’s greatness Is Trump’s erratic diplomacy destroying the greatness of America just to make a buck? This question seems to have been answered by a big YES during the midterm elections. Indeed, the American people gave the House of Representatives to the Democrats to counterbalance the massive power of Trump. This result leads the American public, at large, to two possible options: Option 1: This is a prelude to booting out Trump out of office in the next presidential elections in 2020. Option 2: This is a stern message to Trump to review and change his politics and course, to stay in power. Whatever the result of the next presidential elections will be? “America is first” does not, in anyway, come first before “America is great”, for the following reasons: America is a country where anyone can come to power by democratic means but will, also, be reminded by democratic means that he has gone too far.

Rabat – New Moroccan judges from “Group 43” have taken courses in Tamazight (Berber) for the first time in the country, in line with the Justice Ministry’s preparations of an official Tamazight alphabet. In addition to Tamazight, the judges have received professional digitization training to prepare them for online courtrooms in the near future, such as accessing and participating in hearings remotely via video. At the ceremony, justice minister Mohamed Aujjar stated that the new judges are “fortunate” to be part of an independent judicial force in the current technology age to pave the way for the integration and success of digital justice by 2022 in Morocco’s judicial system. The president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, pointed out that the profession of a judge is a “dangerous” one and “not for anyone” because judges must maintain high ethics, confidence, and keep an eye on the latest legal updates and developments. The ceremony, which took place at the higher institute of the magistracy, was attended by the first president of the Court of Cassation, Mustapha Fares, who said that the aspirations of the Moroccan society rest on the shoulders of the new generation of judges. The new graduates will enter the next stage of practical training on Monday before assuming their roles officially. For Tamazight’s better integration into Morocco’s education system, the government presented draft laws 26.16 and 04.16. The first law relates to the integration of Tamazight into national education and administrative institutions and the second to the National Council for the Languages and Culture of Morocco to protect and develop both Arabic and Tamazight. The number of primary school children studying Tamazight in the current academic year has increased to 600,000, according to the secretary of state at the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education, and Scientific Research, Khalid Samadi. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has repeatedly stressed on the use of Tamazight alongside Arabic as the two official languages of the country, in essential documents such as contracts, ID cards, passports, drivers’ licenses, and banknotes. El Othmani repeatedly asserted the need to use only Arabic and Tamazight in official documents instead of foreign languages, such as French, but noted the administrations’ “lack of consideration” of the government’s calls.

Rabat – An international team of archaeologist found “stone tools and cut animal bones” that indicate the earliest pre-humans could have originated there.  The artifacts were found in the Ain Boucherit excavation site near Setif, a town 300 kilometers east of Algiers. Scientists found two distinct groups of artifacts from the site: one group dates back to  about 1.9 million years ago, and the other group can be traced to 2.4 million years ago, according to Science News. The experts analyzing the artifacts believe the area was a prehistoric spot that hunters used to butcher the meat from their kills.  The archaeologists found several “Oldowans,” prehistoric knife-like rocks academics previously thought only existed in East Africa. They also found several cut bones that belonged to the prehistoric ancestors of the modern elephant, crocodile, hippopotamus, and horse.   The Setif team was led by Dr. Mohamed Sahnouni, an Algerian-American archaeologist for the Stone Age Institute at Indiana University.  According to Dr. Sahnouni’s team, their work “show[s] that the North African savanna corridor and the East African one were [once] connected,” and offer a chance for scientists to reexamine earlier findings.  Currently, the oldest found archaeological piece is a 3.3 million year old tool located in Kenya, according to BBC. But earlier this year, scientists also found both the oldest bone knife, as well as the oldest nuclear DNA in Africa, in Morocco. Scientists also discovered a small site in Saudi Arabia that is one of the oldest in the world. This proves that Arabia and North Africa had a much more important role in the development of early pre-human hominids than scientists and historians previously thought.

Rabat – A 23-year-old Moroccan prisoner escaped on Thursday during a doctor’s visit in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, reported the Swiss daily Blick.  Local police confirmed that the prisoner, who is currently in the open, is not a danger for the population because he was not imprisoned for a “violent crime.”  The police are still trying to track down the prisoner, who escaped with handcuffs on, with the use of scent hounds. A similar incident occurred on Wednesday, when a 22-year-old Algerian escaped while at a doctor’s appointment in the Swiss Gommiswald municipality. On the same day, the police found and arrested the Algerian detainee who had been in custody for over a month on a charge of burglary.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy has arrested 32 Moroccan migrants on board three boats for undocumented migrants off Al Hoceima. Spain’s EFE news agency reported that the Moroccan navy arrested the migrants in multiple operations in northeast Morocco. Quoting an anonymous source, EFE said that a Royal Navy boat transported the migrants, most of whom live nearby, to the Al Hoceima port. The agency added that the navy previously arrested 103 migrants on Tuesday, November 27. The news outlet reported the majority of the migrants were from Morocco. The migrants were attempting to cross the Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea on small boats.  On November 28, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) shared that Morocco has disrupted 76,000 undocumented migration attempts in 2018. Minister Delegate to the Minister of Interior Noureddine Boutayeb said that Morocco’s efforts to fight undocumented migration helped to thwart 30 “violent attempts” of undocumented migration into the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. The official also recalled that since 2002, Morocco has dismantled more than 3,400 criminal networks and organized more than 2,000 voluntary returns to home countries for irregular migrants. Boutayeb also discussed Morocco’s immigration policy, saying that the strategy regularized the administrative status of 50,000 immigrants. He added that the strategy launched a series of sectoral programs that have allowed migrants and their families to benefit from all the services provided to Moroccan citizens.

By Trista Youssef Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message to the chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Cheikh Niang, on Thursday.  The King reiterated Morocco’s support for Palestine, describing Moroccan and Palestinian ties as an “emotional relationship which is deeply rooted in the imagination of Moroccans, as individuals and as a nation” in his speech.  King Mohammed VI also referred to his aid program to Gaza in June, which included 113 tons of aid to the Palestinian people. Morocco also provided medical assistance to Palestinians suffering from the May 14 violence when Israeli forces killed 62 Palestinians and injured hundreds following Palestinian protests against the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  “The Palestinian struggle for freedom and independence and for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, has lasted all these years due to the lack of justice, to widespread frustration and to the suffering caused by occupation and injustice,” stated King Mohammed VI. The King’s speech honors Palestine’s 40th International Solidarity Day. The UN General Assembly has recognized November 29 since 1978, as the day marks the UN General Assembly’s adoption of the Partition Plan for Palestine on November 29, 1947. Palestinian government spokesperson Yousef al-Mahmoud called on the international community to support Palestinians in ending Israeli occupation.  “International silence on the occupation and its crimes only encourages Israel to continue violating international resolutions and laws,” said al-Mahmoud on Thursday. Palestinian UN ambassador Riyad Mansour also stated on Thursday’s anniversary, “The international community cannot continue to decry the violation of Palestinian rights and destruction of the two-state solution without acting to end this unlawful situation.”

Rabat – The French Parliament’s lower house has passed a bill banning “corporal punishment or humiliation” during a session Friday morning, according to France 24. French MPs voted nearly unanimously for the bill, 51-1. The bill makes France the 55th country in the world to ban spanking children. Mental health experts are increasingly critical of the practice of physically punishing children, claiming it does not actually discipline the child and can be counterproductive. Sweden made history in 1979 when it became the first country in the world to make spanking children illegal. The UN also condemned corporal punishment in its Convention on the Rights of the Child, ordering states to take “all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse” while in the care of adults. However, spanking is still widespread throughout the world. In the EU, only six other countries besides France allow parents to use corporal punishment. In a report submitted to the UN, the French government admitted most parents in the country believed corporal punishment was a “harmless” way to correct bad behavior. But statistics from organizations like the American Psychological Association indicate that physically punishing children “can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behavior … and mental health problems.” Although banning corporal punishment has become more common in developed countries, in most developing nations spanking children is not questioned. In 2013 in Morocco, the Ministry of Education estimated 90 percent of children suffered corporal punishment in school, which could take the form of “blows with iron rulers, tying children’s legs together with a rope, [and] blows to the hands and fingertips,” among other methods.  The bill in France still has to travel through the Senate before it is formally ratified. Previous administrations in France tried to pass bills against corporate punishment, but conservative MPs previously blocked all attempts at legislation. With the centrist leadership of President Macron, child advocates in France are hoping they have the chance to gain ground in their fight to end spanking.

Rabat – Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq has called on Moroccan philanthropists to help renovate old mosques instead of building new ones. Toufiq said Tuesday  that about 1,000 mosques need to be renovated while speaking at a religious ceremony organized by the ministry on Morocco’s Day of Mosques. Renovating all the mosques will cost MAD 1 billion. He added that renovating a mosque is the moral equivalent of building a new one, and it is better to renovate two or three mosques for the cost of building one mosque. Toufiq called on philanthropists to respect the architectural design of the mosques and not to change them.  He also invited donors to coordinate with the ministry during the construction process, explaining that if they modify the design of the mosque, they will not get permission to open the mosque after construction is completed. Toufiq asserted that Moroccans still frequently donate towards building mosques, especially small and medium-sized mosques. However, the minister revealed that 185 mosques were built across Morocco in 2018, 160 of which were built by single donors.

Rabat – In a press conference on Thursday, the spokesperson said, “I have been asked earlier today about recent press reports regarding the relations between Algeria and Morocco.” He noted that the UN always has been “very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco, whose relationship is very important to the region.” It is the second time the United Nations has supported Morocco’s dialogue initiative offered to Algeria by King Mohammed VI on November 6. In his speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI said that the abnormal diplomatic ties should be resolved through a frank and direct dialogue with Algeria. “I should like to stress that Morocco is willing to consider the proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations,” said the King. Following the King’s speech, Dujarric said that the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, “has always been very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco.” Guterres also welcomed King Mohammed VI’s support for the UN-led political process in Western Sahara. Guterres also expressed hope for the Geneva roundtable, which will convene all parties to the conflict December 5-6  for talks. The UN Security Council also highly welcomed the roundtable.

Rabat- The US Department of State announced today that Trump’s administration is “grateful for Morocco’s leadership” in hosting the Bilateral Proliferation Security Initiative Workshop. The US and Morocco held the workshop November 27-29 in Rabat. According to the US State Department, the symposium served as a platform for the two countries to discuss “authorities and capabilities to indirect suspected transfers of weapons of mass destructions, their delivery sisters and related materials.” The workshop also included maritime and land-based discussions that “provided both governments the opportunity to share national experiences, expertise and best practises to interdict illicit shipments of weapons of mass destruction.” Morocco and the US maintain solid diplomatic ties as both countries are satisfied with their partnership, including military deals. The department announced yesterday that Morocco has requested to purchase hundreds of machine guns and other military equipment from the US. Morocco and the US also have a security collaboration as the North African country provides security assistance in combating terror threats globally. In September, the US State Department said that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” In April, Morocco hosted the US military’s annual African Lion exercise, marking the presence of senior US armed forces members, and partners from 15 countries, representing Africa, Europe, and North America.

Rabat – CNN fired Marc Lamont Hill on Thursday after he gave a speech in the United Nations in which he called for “a free Palestine from the river to the sea.” In his speech on Wednesday, Hill, a professor of media studies at Temple University, expressed his support for Palestinians and invited countries to boycott Israel. Hill’s speech for the UN’s International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People received sharp criticism and Israeli groups considered it a call for the annihilation of Israel.   Israeli officials and Jewish organizations condemned the speech, called CNN to stop inviting Hill to its studios, pressuring the network to dismiss him. The Anti Defamation League (ADL) said, “Those calling for ‘from the river to the sea’ are calling for an end to the State of Israel.”  The ADL added that the phrase “the river to the sea” is used by Hamas and anti-Israel groups. The ADL’s senior vice president for international affairs, Sharon Nazarian, said in a statement that the annual event at the UN “promotes divisiveness and hate.” The CNN contributor took to his Twitter account to defend himself and reply to critics. “My reference to ‘river to the sea’ was not a call to destroy anything or anyone,” he tweeted. “It was a call for justice, both in Israel and in the West Bank/Gaza. My reference to “river to the sea” was not a call to destroy anything or anyone. It was a call for justice, both in Israel and in the West Bank/Gaza. The speech very clearly and specifically said those things. No amount of debate will change what I actually said or what I meant. — Marc Lamont Hill (@marclamonthill) 29 novembre 2018

By Trista Youssef The world’s 20 most economically powerful states will discuss the global economy, climate, and energy reforms today in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has been under an international spotlight since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. The Khashoggi killing was a turning point for many of Saudi Arabia’s allies, with the exception of the United States, which has ruled out suspending arms sales to the Gulf state. The Saudi coalition in Yemen, which the US supports, is also widely opposed by members of the G20. The international summit is speculated to open dialogue among world leaders on the humanitarian crisis. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to address MBS at the conference to discuss Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Yemen and Khashoggi’s murder. In a news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron stated, “I’ve always been very clear about the issue of Saudi Arabia and I will inevitably have the opportunity to discuss it with the Saudi crown prince on the sidelines of the G20.” Mohammed bin Salman’s presence at the international summit comes at a time where world leaders are faced with the dilemma of either alienating strategic and economic interests with Saudi Arabia or neglecting international human rights standards by maintaining close relations with the crown prince. On his way to the G20 Summit, MBS made a regional tour of the Middle East and North Africa. Tunisian protesters met MBS angrily in Tunis, but after King Mohammed VI refused to meet MBS in Rabat, the crown prince chose not to visit Morocco.

Rabat – Mohamed Cheikh Biadillah, co-president of the EU-Morocco Friendship Group, has reiterated Morocco’s position that it cannot sign an agreement with the EU if it excludes the Sahara provinces. Biadillah, who also previously served as the minister of health, discussed the EU-Morocco partnership in an interview with Euro News. When asked about the EU Court of Justice’s ruling that the EU-Morocco agreement does not apply to the waters off Western Sahara, Biadillah said: “For us, they are Moroccan waters.” He then repeated Morocco’s position on the fisheries deal, saying Morocco “cannot sign an agreement that excludes the Sahrawi provinces. It is impossible.” Biadillah also discussed Morocco’s expectations for the UN talks on Western Sahara, which will be held December 5-6. The president of the group said that Morocco is putting “a lot of hope in this December meeting, mainly because Algeria will participate as an actor.” He added that Morocco is going to the meeting with “transparency, respect and responsibility.” He said Algeria needs to come to meeting with “the same political will, in order to find a solution that preserves the interests of the whole world, and for us the Moroccan territorial integrity with its Sahara, obviously.” The parties and neighboring countries to the conflict were invited to the talk by UNSG Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Horst Kohler. The UN Security Council supported Kohler’s decision to convene Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario around a table for discussion that might lead to future negotiations on the conflict. Through Resolution 2440, the Security Council also called on all four parties to “work constructively” with Kohler to ensure the success of the UN-led political process. When the interviewer asked about Morocco’s position on a referendum in Western Sahara, Biadillah said, “They always ask me about the referendum, but the [Sahrawi] electorate has not been able to be defined by the United Nations.” He also recalled the position of former Dutch UNSG Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Peter Van Walsum, who told the Security Council in 2008 that “independence” for Western Sahara was “unrealistic.” Biadillah said that the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps in Algeria “has never been registered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and they do not have a refugee card.” He added that the Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps “have never been asked if they wanted to return.” Biadillah said that Sahrawi people in the Tindouf represent only 20 percent of the population, while those who are in Morocco’s southern provinces represent 80 percent. He also denied repression of Sahrawis in southern provinces, saying allegations are false and people who “visited the region know it very well.”

Rabat – The secretary-general of Algeria’s Workers Party Louisa Hanoune has said that she does not understand why her country remains silent on Morocco’s dialogue offer. Quoted by TSA, Hanoune said, “the King of Morocco has issued an invitation for a dialogue without conditions or taboos with the Algerian authorities.” “We did not understand, up to now, the silence of the Algerian diplomatic corps,” she said. While acknowledging that it was a different subject, she approved of Algeria’s request for an emergency meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union(AMU) foreign affairs ministers, saying it “is good.”Hanoune said the AMU meeting would be about “only the AMU, but about opening a dialogue between the leaders of the two countries.” She added that the Algerian diplomatic corps has made everyone in Algeria “accustomed” to “respond, with force, to all situations in the past.” It has been nearly one month since King Mohammed VI announced Morocco’s dialogue offer to Algeria on Green March Day, November 6, inviting Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue to normalize diplomatic bonds with its neighbor. Up to this point, Algeria has not officially responded to Rabat’s offer. Morocco’s eastern neighbour only issued the statement requesting a meeting of the AMU’s foreign affairs ministers. Rabat said that Algeria’s indirect response was unrelated to the royal initiative, saying that Morocco wants to get an official response from Algeria. In response to Algeria’s AMU invitation, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the state of “lethargy that the AMU has known for years, is mainly due to the abnormal nature of Moroccan-Algerian relations, which can be treated only in the framework of a bilateral dialogue, direct and without intermediaries.” The ministry said that Morocco is for the meeting of the AMU, but the government still wants to receive a more official response from Algeria.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has reportedly stripped the hosting rights of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) from Cameroon because it was struggling to finish building the football venues. Moroccan sports television channel Arriyadia said that CAF has “officially” stripped Cameroon of the rights. The decision was made in a meeting in Accra today after the latest reports from CAF’s inspection missions revealed that Cameroon was not ready to host the tournament. CAN, also called AFCON, will take place June 15 to July 13, 2019. CAF will now launch a new bidding process to appoint another host for the African tournament. Local and international news outlets have repeatedly speculated this year that Morocco might replace Cameroon. South Africa might also try to clinch the hosting rights. Earlier this year, Morocco’s sports officials denied that Morocco wanted to replace Cameroon and repeatedly said that Morocco supports Cameroon’s bid. But after Cameroon’s failure to get ready in time, Morocco could be a possible option.  In August, CAF Chairman Ahmad Ahmad cast doubt over Cameroon’s readiness to host Africa’s biggest football event. “I am not sure Cameroon is ready to host the AFCON,”  Ahmad told KweseESPN. CAN 2019 will boast the participation of 24 national teams, up from the usual 16.  After playing qualifier games against Cameroon, Malawi, and the Comoros and scoring a satisfying 2-0 win against Cameroon, Morocco has qualified for the next round of the competition.

Rabat – The French NGO “Vaincre L’autisme” and its international scientific committee have published a white paper on the autism spectrum to help families better understand the condition. The 30-page  report is available for free on the association’s website in both French and English and contains information about the spectrum condition, also called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), for the sake of global awareness. M’Hammed Sajidi, president of Vaincre L’autisme, stated: “This White Paper … collects all the current datas (sic) of medicine and science of autism..” Sahidi says that the paper is a “world premiere” publication and is easy to read, providing information about autism diagnosis, genetic causes, and treatments.  The paper is “aimed at all stakeholders, all societies, their government and their media,” and “will widely disseminate valuable knowledge for a coherent and rational public action,” states the website. As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), autism is “a range of conditions characterised by some degree of impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.” The WHO estimates that 1 in 160 children worldwide have autism. Morocco does not have relevant official data for autism numbers, and healthcare focused on autism is nearly non-existent in the country. The lack of research or medical training specialized in autism has caused misconceptions and lack of awareness about autism in the North African country. Parents of children with autism are left to handle the condition alone. Morocco’s educational system does not provide much scope for children to study freely. Children with autism sometimes find little space in classrooms in public or private schools.

Rabat – The US State Department announced on November 29 that it has approved a “possible foreign military sale to Morocco.” The department added that the deal is for the enhancement of 162 Abrams tanks with machine guns and rounds for an estimated $1.259 billion. The deal is pending approval of the Congress. The statement said that the tank enhancements Morocco requested will help the North African country to reach its goal “of updating its military capability while further enhancing interoperability with the United States and other allies.” The US State Department asserted that Morocco will have “no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.” The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified the US Congress of the possible military deal with Morocco on November 28. The statement added that the possible military deal includes 162 M2 Chrysler Mount Machine Guns; 324 M240 machine guns; 1,035 M865 training SABOT rounds; and 1,610 M831Al HEAT rounds.  The department said that the possible sale of the M1A1 tank enhancements would “contribute to the modernization of Morocco’s tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet current and future threats.” The sale followed another deal between Morocco and the US. On November 7, the US Department of Defense said that it contracted with DRS Network &amp; Imaging Systems for $129 million in foreign military sales for six countries, including Morocco, to prepare military software. Morocco also ordered 200 American M1AI Abrams tanks. By August, Morocco had received at least 127 of the Abrams tanks. Global Firepower ranked Morocco 55th among 136 countries in its 2018 military strength ranking. Algeria was ranked 23rd in the same ranking. Morocco has 1,276 combat tanks, 2,348 armored fighting vehicles (AFV), and more than 700 artilleries of three different types: 448 self-propelled artilleries, 192 towed artilleries, and 72 rocket projectors.  Pending approval, the possible purchase from Morocco’s largest military supplier will increase its military capacity. The sale would also include spare parts, support equipment, and training. Morocco spends more than any other country in Africa on military equipment, except for Algeria. Morocco spends $3.4 billion annually on defense and ranks 51st in military spending globally.

Rabat – NASA’s Planetary Studies Department head Kamal Oudrhiri said, “Landing on Mars is one of the most improbable scientific achievements in terms of global exploration.”  The Moroccan scientist, who contributed to the InSight Mars project, said that the success rate of the project was only 40 percent and his team speculated a 60 percent chance of failure. Oudrhiri said that the project’s 300-member team “carried out this project with mutual trust, diligence, patience and unflinching diligence.” The Moroccan scientist explained that the Mars project aims to analyze the internal composition of Mars, also known as the red planet. He added that the InSight spacecraft was equipped with a seismometer and a heat flow sensor. Oudrhiri said that while waiting to hear if InSight landed successfully, he was wearing a shirt with his father’s initials, M.O.,  sewed into it. “I wanted to pay homage to my father but also to the role and the sacrifices that parents make for the education and success of their children,” said Oudrhiri. Oudrhiri has worked for NASA for more than 20 years. From Fez, Oudrhiri completed his graduate studies in space communication in the US. The scientist joined NASA in 1996. The scientist has been recognized with several NASA achievement honor awards from the planetary scientific community. Besides InSight, the Moroccan scientist has contributed to several other NASA projects, including Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity and Rovers. Oudrhiri also oversees the Cold Atom Lab mission on behalf of NASA. The InSight lander touched down on Mars on Monday, November 26. “The whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,” said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

Rabat – Algeria has deployed nearly 6,000 kilometers of barbed wire on its border with Morocco, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. The barbed wire is nearly four times the length of the border. The fence also includes surveillance cameras. While Morocco has called for more dialogue and enhanced security cooperation between the two countries, Algeria has not directly responded but has tightening security at the closed border to “combat migration and terrorism.” Both Moroccan and Algerian news outlets, as well as the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reported about Algeria’s increased border protection. Citing anonymous Algerian sources, Al Massae reported that Algeria built hundreds of control towers along the new barbed wire fence with new generation radar operating day and night. Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994. Algeria made  the decision after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Tension between Morocco and Algeria dates back decades. In October 1963, they fought the Sand War over the border near Figuig in eastern Morocco. The war ended a year later when the US, the African Union, and the Arab League mediated the conflict. Since then, the border has only been opened between 1988 and 1994. After the decades-long conflict, Morocco extended its hand to break the stalemate by proposing a mechanism of dialogue and consultation at the initiative of King Mohammed VI. The King called on Algeria to propose any initiative that could normalize their diplomatic ties. The president of Algerian opposition party Rally of Culture and Democracy (RCD), Mohcine Belabbas, believes that “a consensus exists among Algerian political actors to reopen the Algerian-Moroccan borders.” For his part, the chairman of the MPS Algerian Islamist, Abderrazak Makri, called on both counties to reopen the border. He said the decision to close the borders must be “reviewed.”

Rabat – Moroccan and Belgian business actors signed 21 agreements and MoUs on Wednesday.  The agreements and MoUs cover different sectors including maritime, pharmacy, finance, agro-food, renewable energy, chemistry, construction, water resources protection, and metallurgy. With a common desire to share best practices and expertise between Morocco and Belgium, the signed agreements aim to improve services, generate new business opportunities and implement industrial development projects in Morocco. Some of the companies that signed partnership agreements include Morocco’s OCP Group, a leading exporter and producer of phosphate-based fertilizers, and Belgium’s Waterleau, a solutions provider to industry treatment of water, air, waste, and energy recovery. During a bilateral meeting on Tuesday, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Princess Astrid of Belgium recognized that there are opportunities to boost economic cooperation between Morocco and Belgium. Morocco, according to Flemish Minister-President Geert Bourgeois, is investing not only in conventional infrastructure, but also in many other sectors where Flemish companies excel, such as renewable energies and water purification. The Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Services of Casablanca-Settat and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Wallonia also signed joint agreement. The Moroccan Institute for Standardization (IMANOR) and the Walloon Agency for Export and Foreign Investment (AWEX) signed an agreement on the Halal certification of Walloon SME exporters to the African and European Francophone markets. The National Employment Promotion Agency (ANAPEC) and the Brussels Regional Office for Employment (ACTIRIS) also signed a partnership agreement with the aim to share successful experiences to integrate remote and weakened people in labor market The Belgian business actors came to Morocco as part of a large delegation  of 460 businessmen, entrepreneurs, and ministers, led by Princess Astrid. The delegation, consisting of some 400 economic operators representing more than 250 companies, is currently on a visit to Morocco from November 25 to30. The delegation involves representatives of many sectors, particularly chemistry, renewable energy, transport and logistics, and health.

Rabat – The 2018 Ernst &amp; Young Africa Attractiveness Survey showed that South Africa has maintained its position as the top foreign direct investment (FDI) destination in Africa. However, for the first time, South Africa now shares the top position with Morocco. “We are also seeing investment shifting between countries for the first time. South Africa, once the clear leader in attracting FDI, now shares the top rank with Morocco,” reads the survey’s summary. “This is the first time that South Africa has been challenged in terms of being the most preferred investment destination.”  According to the 2018 survey report, Morocco and South Africa attracted 96 FDI projects each in 2017.  While Morocco’s FDI projects in 2017 increased from 81 in 2016, South Africa’s projects dropped from 139 in 2016.  “Morocco’s position should serve as a wakeup call and motivator for South Africa,” Petrus de Kock, Brand South Africa’s general manager for research said.  “Morocco’s standing as FDI destination is solidifying and the country is on a trajectory to intensify its FDI credentials in the coming years,” de Kock added. Morocco also jumped 9 places since 2017 and ranked 60th out of 190 countries in the 2019 World Bank’s “Doing Business” ranking. Improving its 2017 global ranking of 69th by nine places and two points, Morocco owes its score of 71.02 out of 100 to several new entrepreneurship-friendly policies. The North African country scored 67.91 points last year. The survey stated that Africa received 718 FDI projects in 2017 compared to 676 projects in 2016, an increase of 6 percent. The top five FDI-attracting destinations, led by Morocco and South Africa, included Kenya with 67 projects, rising from 40 in 2016; Nigeria with 64 from 54 in 2016; and Ethiopia with 62 projects. “Ethiopia made a momentous improvement with an increase of 288 percent of foreign direct investment, from only 16 in 2016, to 62 projects in 2017,” the survey said. During a meeting with Princess Astrid of Belgium and several Belgian politicians, El Othmani spoke about Morocco’s achievements in improving its business climate and promoting investment.  Morocco aims to be among the top 50 countries in the Doing Business rankings by 2021, El Othmani stressed. Morocco’s efforts have positively impacted the flow of foreign direct investment, which has improved significantly, added El Othmani.

Rabat – In a post on his Facebook page, El Hannoudi announced that starting next Monday he will take the necessary procedures to sell his car and assist in improving school transport services in the region. To help relieve school children from the difficulty of finding transport, El Hannoudi promised that school transport services will be available for free to pick up students starting Monday, December 3. According to El Hannaoui, the regional committee had already approved his project. El Hannaoui also vowed to assist in facilitating transport by providing new school buses to reach more rural villages as of the coming weeks, in addition to organizing school trips as means of entertainment for students. The lack of financial resources and inconsistencies toward improving school transport is what prompted El Hannaoui to make the decision to sell his government vehicle and personally supervise the current initiative. El Hannaoui emphasized that there was an agreement on school transport services between the Lota locality and a local association that did not go smoothly, especially in terms of the delays to carry out the project. More than 240 students need transport to attend middle and high schools in the region, which further encouraged El Hannaoui to take the initiative. The municipality already has a total share of MAD 140,000 and will need MAD 360,000 to continue the project, according to El Hannaoui. The majority of students in rural regions walk kilometers to reach their school. Lack of transport services, namely school buses, makes it harder for many to pursue their education, especially girls.

Rabat – Morocco is now second-in-command of the African Council for Scientific Research and Innovation (ASRIC). Morocco’s delegation for the meeting consisted of academics recruited from the Hassan II Academy of Science and Technology in Rabat.  Morocco is joined by Zambia, Nigeria, and Cameroon, and they plan to work to “mobilize African research excellence and innovation,” according to the African Union’s website. The AU held the meeting in the Nigerian capital from November 27 29 at the Abuja Sheraton. Representatives from throughout the continent met to launch the newly-created ASRIC. The meeting included directors from different research councils, the AU’s leading scientists, investment agencies, elements of the private sector, and civil servants. The director of the Hassan II Academy also travelled to Abuja to represent his school. The ASRIC hopes to stimulate scientific work by forming a collaborative network of scientists from throughout Africa and sharing research and data. Morocco’s leadership position in this new organization is a sign of the increased involvement that the country is commiting to in the organization. Earlier this year, Morocco was also elected to the AU’s Peace and Security council. After exiting the AU for 33 years ago, Morocco recently rejoined the group in 2017;  since then, it has worked to steadily prove itself as a leader in politics, economics, and science on the continent. During a trip to Tanzania shortly after the reunion, King Mohammed VI said that “[i]t is a beautiful day when one returns home after too long of an absence,” a sign that the country will likely continue to mold an important place for itself in the organization in the years to come.

Rabat – In the past six years, the number of women who have lost their lives due to cervical cancer, which is often caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), has reached an alarming rate in Morocco and the rest of the MENA region. The statistics are from the latest report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The tragic results could be blamed on the lack of awareness about the disease and measures to prevent it. Alim El Gaddari, Director of the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition (ITPC-Mena) stated: “The tragedy is that we know how to prevent, detect and treat HPV-related diseases, lack of political will, stigma and misinformation are all obstacles to overcome to eliminate these cancers and save lives.”  Causes of HPV, which often leads to cervical cancer, are various. According to England’s National Health Service (NHS),  “HPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity – such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas or using sex toys – and is very common.”  Yet, HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer, and other risks may include smoking. HPV is a set of viruses rather than one virus.  There are more than 100 different types of HPV, says the NHS. Symptoms of cervical cancer include irregular, intermenstrual or abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse, fatigue, weight loss, back leg or pelvic pain, weight loss, and swollen legs, says the World Health Organization (WHO). HPV vaccination and early screening, the first preventive measures Vaccination against HPV infections is the main preventive measure to take against cervical cancer and other types of cancer such as anal or penile cancer, and should occur before the beginning of one’s sex life. The effectiveness of HPV vaccination is close to 100 percent and is available in more than 90 countries including Senegal, UAE, and Libya since 2006. The vaccine is currently offered as part of the National Immunization Program and is highly recommended by WHO since 2009, the report said. “It’s time to vaccinate our children against HPV. A vaccine made today will save lives tomorrow,” states Aicha Kharbache, obstetrician, Head of Unit at Avicenne University Hospital in Rabat, and Vice President of the Moroccan League for STD Control. In 2015, the Moroccan government finally introduced the anti-HPV vaccination to eliminate cervical cancer in line with Morocco’s 2025 health plan. Arguably, the Moroccan society is still not fully aware of the importance of taking preventive measures against the disease. For this reason, the Regional Coalition for HPV Elimination and the regional office of the ITPC are urging the North African country to give priority to raising awareness about HPV and introduce HPV vaccine into “the vaccination calendar for boys and girls aged between 9 and 13 years and to make available to all vulnerable populations under the age of 45.” Early screening is equally important and must be done every three years by age categories from 25 to 65 years old. The high cost of the vaccination, however, remains an issue, as equal access to treatment is very low. “coverage rates in Morocco do not exceed 10 percent.” The total cost of cervical cancer care for one year after diagnosis is $13,589, whereas the cost of HPV vaccine obtained by countries similar to Morocco is around $9.58 dollars per dose, the report concluded.

By Trista Youssef Rabat – Hundreds of protesters held demonstrations against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s arrival in Tunisia on Tuesday. The protests targeted MBS for his alleged involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  The demonstrations took place in the Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the famous site of Tunisian protests during the Arab Spring.  On Monday the Tunisian Journalists Syndicate released a statement referring to the crown prince as a “true enemy of freedom of expression.” The organization also announced plans to file a lawsuit against MBS for war crimes in Yemen.  A banner reading “No to the desecration of Tunisia, the land of the revolution,” hung from the Journalists Syndicate headquarters.  Members of the Tunisian Bar Association attempted to file a motion blocking MBS’s visit in symbolic protest.  Civil activist Emna Mizouni stated in an interview, “Everyone is against whitewashing oppression. Unfortunately, our Arab brothers could not organise similar protests.” Mizouni stated that Tunisians were demonstrating “in the name of all oppressed Arab people” who did not have the privileges of organized public protest.  The demonstrations included civil activists as well as artists and street performers, who mocked the Saudi crown prince’s war in Yemen through satirical performances.  Hamza Nasri, a mime artist portraying MBS in a street performance, stated, “Simply said, we came here today to say that the Tunisian people – who have exported the revolution to the rest of the Arab world and who fought for justice, dignity and human rights – cannot welcome a criminal like bin Salman.”

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – In Alicante, Spain, the Guardia Civil prevented the forced marriage of a 17-year-old girl to a 37-year-old man from Morocco. The Guardia Civil detained the girl’s father and brother, who worked together to orchestrate the forced marriage. According to the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, a source alerted authorities about the situation soon before the minor was sent to Morocco. While the minor was born and raised in Spain, her family is Moroccan. When authorities met with the minor, they learned the girl’s family had prohibited her from leaving the home freely or attending school. She also revealed to the police that her family abused and mistreated her throughout her adolescence.  In March, after her family had announced that she would be married to a man from a small town in Morocco, the teen attempted to commit suicide. After the suicide attempt, the family brought her to meet her future husband in Morocco and then returned to Spain, according to El Pais. Spanish authorities arrested the minor’s 29-year-old brother on charges of domestic abuse and coercion. The minor has been provided protection at a youth shelter in Spain and hopes to continue her studies. In August of 2018, a similar case unfolded when a 16-year-old from Malaga, Spain, reported to police that she was being forced into a marriage with a 28-year-old Moroccan man whom she had never met. The mother was detained and the minor transitioned to a youth shelter. The international campaign “16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence” is commemorated annually beginning on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25 until Human Rights Day on December 10. Around Morocco, women are sharing their stories and engaging in discussions to bring awareness to the gender-based discrimination and abuse they face. According to UNICEF, 15 million girls worldwide are forced into child marriages every year. Around the world, one in five girls are married before the age of 18, while in Africa, the rate is one in three. The practice of child marriage is rooted in economic motives, cultural beliefs and inequality between sexes.  In Morocco, around 16 percent of girls are married before the age of 18, estimates UNICEF. According to the advocacy group Girls Not Brides, child marriage is often seen in Morocco as a form of economic security, especially in rural areas. A lack of educational resources and economic opportunities for young girls is one source of the problem.  Morocco implemented Law 103-13 in September of 2018, criminalizing violence against women and restricting forced marriage. However, the law was criticized for its inability to clearly define forced marriage and for creating loopholes that would allow for child marriage.

Rabat – Thursday morning, popular French car maker Renault announced at its Moroccan office it is launching a branch of the Renault Foundation in Morocco. The mission of the foundation is to promote social welfare where Renault has a presence. According to Renault’s website, the foundation works to promote sustainable mobility and inclusion. It pursues the goals through supporting education and fighting social discrimination. Renault has opened foundations across the world in its quest to bring social change and has offices in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, France, and Romania. Portugal and Morocco are the newest locations that Renault expanded its foundation to, and the Renault Morocco team are already adamant of the success the foundation will bring.  Marc Nassif, CEO of Renault’s Morocco Group and president of the new Moroccan foundation, spoke at the foundation’s presentation ceremony, where he said, “Renault Morocco Foundation is a renewed promise for the future.” Nassif stressed, “In a global economy, the human must remain at the center of the concerns,” Le Matin reported.  In addition to promoting social equality, the foundation also works on campaigns fighting unsafe road conditions through a project called “Tkayes.” Through Renault’s expansion of global philanthropic efforts, the company is building its image as a benevolent corporation, but it is also making international connections that may translate into it being a more prominent international player as well.

Rabat – Côte d’Ivoire is planning to ask the government of France to return approximately 100 different pieces of art, according to a statement from Ivorian Communications Minister Sidi Toure. Historians and authorities from the Côte d’Ivoire compiled a list that will be sent to France and examined by experts, according to France 24. Côte d’Ivoire is one among a growing list of former African colonies demanding property back that Western nations took during the colonial age. Countries like Benin, Ethiopia, and Nigeria are already petitioning the governments of France and the UK to return hundreds of years of cultural items. Priceless artifacts like Benin’s “King Ghezo’s throne of Abomey” currently lie in museums across Europe. A majority of the museums are reluctant to hand them back to their home countries. Several museums proposed a “loan” system, returning the artifacts to Africa for a finite amount of time. In a report written for al Jazeera on the ethics of museums, journalist Rafia Zakaria stated, “Museums fight against having to reveal the provenance of objects.” She continued, “They know that many of the objects in their vast collections have illicit histories behind them.” According to Zakaria, museums know their artifacts have dubious origins, but they do not want to fix the problem. Saharan African nations made similar demands. Egypt asked for the return of the bust of Queen Nefertiti, which the Germans took in 1913. During his inauguration speech, President Macron promised he would “return African heritage to Africa.” But as the calls grow, Macron is dragging his feet. When questioned about his response to Côte d’Ivoire’s request, he said he would call “on other European countries to consider their position,” according to French news outlets.

Rabat – Spain’s Instituto Cervantes found that 1.7 million Moroccans have mastered Spanish. In a new 2018 report, the Spanish non-profit cultural institution ranks Morocco second only to the United States in the number of Spanish speakers for a non-Spanish speaking country.  The number includes Moroccans who received professional training in Spanish, those who learned Spanish in primary school, and others who pursued studies at Cervantes centers across Morocco.  More than 22,000 Moroccan Spanish speakers live in Morocco’s southern provinces, which Spain colonized from 1884 to 1975. The study emphasized that Spanish is the fourth most-spoken language in the world with 577 million Spanish speakers, including 480 million who speak it as their mother tongue. On a global scale, Spanish ranks only behind English, Mandarin Chinese, and French. Arabic is the fifth most spoken language. Instituto Cervantes asserted that it had spent two years gathering the data and noted the lack of attention that Moroccan universities pay to Spanish compared to other foreign languages used in the country such as French and English. In Morocco, French remains the dominant foreign language, owing to 44 years of French rule from 1912 to 1956. The two official languages in Morocco are Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). When it comes to the mastery of the English language, Morocco’s proficiency is considered “very low” according to Education First’s (EF) 2018 English Proficiency Index. Morocco ranked 60th out of 88 countries with a score of 48.10. Morocco’s score of 48.10 represents an incremental improvement from the EF’s 2017 report, which scored the country with 47.91. Women who were tested in Morocco scored 50.50 on average, whereas their male counterparts scored 46.44.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba has arrived in Rabat to recuperate after a stroke at the invitation of King Mohammed VI. The King persuaded Ondimba to choose Morocco instead of London. The president, who suffered the stroke in Saudi Arabia in October left Riyadh this morning, according to a Moroccan diplomatic source, AFP reported. On Tuesday, Ondimba’s wife announced that the president would leave Riyadh for Rabat to finish recovery. Bongo’s wife, Sylvia Bongo Ondimba said, “To pursue his recovery, the president, consulting his close family members, has made the decision to accept the proposal of his brother, His Majesty the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI … My husband will arrive tomorrow in Rabat, the capital.” AFP reported that the president’s recovery would take a few weeks. Gabon’s Vice-President Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou had already taken over official duties in Bongo’s absence. King Mohammed VI and the Gabonese president share strong friendship.  In 2017, Bongo shared a picture of himself and King Mohammed VI as teenagers, illustrating the long-standing friendship between them.

By Trista Youssef Rabat – On Wednesday, a 63-37 vote advanced a US Senate motion to limit Trump’s support for Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen by adopting a war powers resolution.  Trump has threatened to veto the resolution if it passes. If Trump vetoes, the Senate could only override him with 67 votes. The resolution honors a rarely activated clause from the 1973 War Powers Act, which gives Congress authority to override the president’s deployment of troops during wartime if Congress has not authorized the conflict. The resolution was prompted by Senate opposition to Saudi Arabia’s killing of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. The murder has increased global scrutiny of the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen. Trump’s decision to support Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite the CIA’s conclusion of the crown prince’s responsibility for Khashoggi murder, met large opposition from US politicians.  “We sent an important message today—that Congress will stand up to Saudi leadership when the Trump administration won’t, and that Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the murder of Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi as well as for the disastrous war in Yemen,” said Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.  The United Nations, international NGOs, and humanitarian organizations have widely condemned the Saudi-led coalition for attacking civilians and failing to compensate victims or provide sufficient aid.  Since the escalation of the Yemen war in early 2015, an estimated 14 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. It is also estimated that 85,000 children have died from hunger in the Saudi-Iranian proxy war.  The issue of US involvement is complex, as removing support for the Saudi-led coalition would interfere with the Trump administration’s strategy to contain Iran in the Middle East by keeping a close alliance with Saudi Arabia. US Senator James Lankford voiced concern that without American guidance, Saudi Arabia’s violent activity in Yemen would escalate. “If we pull out of helping what’s happening, civilian casualties increase in Yemen absolutely,” said Lankford.

Rabat – The European Council has decided that the scope of the fisheries deal between Morocco-EU “should be defined so as to include the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara” in southern Morocco. On November 27, the Brussels-based council shared a document to announce its decision on the fisheries deal.  The council also recalled that it had authorized the EU Commission to start “negotiations with the Kingdom of Morocco with a view to amending the Agreement agreeing on a new Implementation protocol.” The decision of the EU and its council brushed aside Polisario’s repeated claims that Morocco exploits the natural resources of Western Sahara. In July, the EU and Morocco agreed to renew their fisheries agreement, which expired on June 14. The council said that the agreement aims to enable the two partners “to work together more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy.” It also seeks to promote the fisheries sector and a blue economy. The council added that the fisheries deal should benefit the people concerned, “owing to the positive-economic impacts on those people, particularly in terms of employment and investment.” The council also decided that the agreement has a positive impact on the development of the fisheries sector and fish processing sector because the fishing activities are in line with the “best scientific advice and recommendations.” The council also said that “extensive consultations” took place in Western Sahara and in Morocco with the attendance of socio-economic and political actors who were “clearly in favor of concluding the Fisheries Agreement.” The council also reaffirmed its support for the UN-led political process in the face of claims by the Polisario that the EU is siding with Morocco’s position. The agreement added that “it should be possible for Union fleets to continue the fishing activities they had pursued since the entry into force of the Agreement.” It also stressed that the renewal of the agreement is “essential in order for that territory to continue to benefit from the sectoral support provided under the Agreement.” Morocco and the EU are also set to renew their agriculture agreement. On November 21, the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) adopted the Morocco-EU agriculture deal. For Morocco, the vote reflects the positive position of political groups that represent the commission and the EU Parliament.

Rabat – Greeted with fervor and enthusiasm in the UAE and Egypt, decried in Morocco and Tunisia, and denounced in most of the world, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s abrupt fall from grace in Arab and global politics bears the marks of a curious tale of political miscalculations and an insatiable thirst for self-aggrandizement. Putting behind weeks of tense international outcry over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince has since Thursday, November 22, embarked on a world tour. Featuring destinations such as the UAE, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania, the tour came as a prelude to the G20 summit scheduled this Friday in Argentina. Given the coincidence—perhaps calculated—critics have been quick to suggest a desire by the Saudi royal court to use visits in the region to prepare the increasingly isolated crown prince for the challenging reunion with global leaders. ‘Thank you my King’: Moroccans happy MBS did not visit Morocco Moroccans are glad that the Saudi prince did not include Rabat in his ongoing tour. Relishing the fact that King Mohammed VI snubbed the Saudi prince’s request for a royal audience, Moroccan social media writhed in denunciation of MBS. Some, reacting to the news of the King declining, albeit diplomatically, MBS’s request, heaped praise on King Mohammed VI. They said his move was commendable and thanked him for “standing tall,” upholding “Morocco’s dignity,” and “saying no to a murderer.” Others, while visibly “happy” about the possibility of Morocco snubbing MBS and Saudi Arabia, were still doubtful, reluctant. They questioned the veracity of the news. While Moroccans did not take to the streets—perhaps they did not have to—like their Tunisian “brothers,” their anger and frustration at Saudi Arabia was unmistakable, palpable. That MBS did not come to Morocco was good riddance, they said en masse. The King’s move, they elaborated, was a “good” and sensible step. “He deserves global isolation,” one said on Facebook. The commenter added that Morocco and Moroccans have no intention of collaborating with the Saudis. A ‘deliberate affront’ Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the Guardian that MBS’s tour was a deliberate affront to the international community. By daring to go on a first major diplomatic trip amid fresh global outcry over the Khashoggi case, MBS is brazenly telling the world that he is back in town, unaffected and in charge, Riedel explained. He said: “We have a crown prince for whom the Khashoggi thing is only one part of reckless and dangerous policies.” John Allerman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agreed. “This is a bold effort to force the issue of whether world leaders are willing to work with Saudi Arabia, saying if you’re going to do that, you’re going to have to work with Mohammed bin Salman,” he told the British paper. All the same, MBS was warmly welcomed in Abu Dhabi and Cairo, his first two destinations. Abu Dhabi threw him a party—and pledged unconditional brotherly support. In Cairo, President al-Sisi assured the prince that Egypt will remain a loyal and reliable ally. Boos in Tunisia After the UAE and Egypt’s fist bumps, however, the Saudi prince’s mood experienced a dramatic fall as many Tunisians protested his presence in their country. Prior to the prince’s visit on Tuesday, November 27, Tunisian activists and journalists wrote a damning petition to object to the princely trip. Pointing out the prince’s implication in Khashoggi’s death and his documented bleak record on human rights, they wrote that Tunisia was not ready to welcome a “murderer” and a “jailer” of human rights and feminist activists. But the boisterous protests and audacious petitioning deterred neither the Tunisian government from hosting their Saudi guest nor MBS himself from proceeding with his initial travel plans. Rallied at the iconic Habib Bourguiba Avenue in downtown Tunis, protesters raised their voice against “an appalling murderer.” Tunisians, in great numbers, took to social media to berate Saudi Arabia’s dubious reforms. In Tunis, the Saudi prince incurred the ire of a raucous and restless public opinion that wanted nothing but to denounce and decry a “war criminal.”
“We are here to underline our dignity, our national sovereignty and to say we are not for sale,” a prominent activist was quoted by local outlets as saying. A dramatic turn-around from the ‘bold reformer’ Just a few months ago, MBS came across as the Arab world’s torch bearer of progressive and democratic reforms. Praised for his youthful boldness and liberal-minded moves, MBS was, to many Western observers, the embodiment of 21st century Arab politics’ messianic figure. Portrayed as a “reformer” and a “moderate,” the young prince was granted the performative aura of the revolutionary that Saudi Arabia and the Muslim world needed—and had been waiting for. Editorials and opinion articles abounded to celebrate his reforms. Be it the Guardian, the Washington Post, the New York Times, or Le Monde, it is difficult to think of a major media outlet that did not bombard their audience with obsequious articles on the de facto Saudi leader. It did not matter that Saudi Arabia cracked down on dissidents or that prominent journalists sought safe haven outside the Saudi kingdom or that women were still denied the most basic rights. All that mattered, we were told, was that corruption was being crushed and cinema—apparently a marker of progress and political enlightenment—was coming back to Saudi Arabia after a 35-year ban. MBS then stood for some kind of Arab awakening, or “Arab Spring, Saudi style,” as the Times’ Pulitzer-winning journalist Thomas Friedman wrote in a particularly laudatory article. With his “moderate” and “balanced” Islam receptive of difference, the young prince, Friedman wrote, was “a fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country.” “The Saudi Revolution Begins,” the Economist headlined a June 2018 issue, jumping on the bandwagon of pro-MBS PR. “Mohammed bin Salman could transform the Arab and Islamic world for the better,” the British newspaper offered. As time went by, however, the prince’s reformist tempo tempered, leaving space for what the world had—perhaps deliberately—glossed over: Human rights abuses en masse and outright disdain for criticism. There was the utterly irrational feud with Canada. The powerful of the world watched but said nothing, emboldening MBS in his sweeping anti-criticism antics. After all, why speak about a dozen jailed activists, a sizable but apparently disposable number of exiled dissidents, and a diplomatic feud with a developed but minor geopolitical weight (Canada) when you can speak of the prince’s bold reforms? Then on October 2, what should not have happened happened. Saudi Arabia went too far, killing a well-connected Saudi citizen on foreign soil. What followed is perhaps the most dramatic scene in contemporary politics. “It was like a movie,” Turkey’s President Erdogan famously said of the Turkish intelligence-recorded tape of Jamal Khashoggi’s “heinous” murder. In a matter of weeks, as Saudi Arabia kept issuing shaky, shifting, and self-contradictory statements on Khashoggi’s disappearance, and later confessing to his murder, international air became suffocating for MBS. Turkey, of course, swiftly played its part in discrediting the powerful prince. In the eyes of many in the international community, gone was the moderate, balanced, reformist, and democracy-loving MBS. Once hailed and cherished, the Saudi now stood isolated and abandoned before Turkey’s incessant accusatory statements. He faced the melding voice of an irritated crowd shouting down a hated and hatable figure. “Mohammed bin Salman was never a reformer,” opined veteran Indian political commentator Dilip Hiro. All the hype about pro-women reforms and cinema and corruption-purging was merely a semblance of modernization meant to theatrically render a police state more palatable to the West, the Indian suggested. That has since been the dominant discourse about MBS as leaked evidence after leaked evidence linked him to the murder of Khashoggi. A shift or continuing trend in Rabat-Riyadh relations? In light of the Khashoggi murder, will the popular consensus on the need for Morocco to thoroughly revise its diplomatic stance with Riyadh succeed in convincing authorities in Rabat to initiate an unprecedented u-turn in how they relate to Saudi strategic interests? Although questioning King Mohammed VI’s move (declining to host MBS) carries some degree of legitimacy, especially given the somewhat purveyor-receiver dynamic between Saudi Arabia and Morocco, the recent incident is hardly the first time Rabat has stood up to Riyadh. Morocco has boycotted the Gulf Cooperation Council; refused to join the Saudi-led blockade against Qatar; repeatedly, but again diplomatically, declined to host the Arab League summit; and boycotted said summit. Add that to recent developments, and the suggestion is that Rabat and Riyadh are progressively drifting apart. When, how, and to what extent will a rift occur beyond the current lukewarm and half-hearted commitment? Or is it all some kind of temporary quarrel that will settle itself when the current shifting sands beneath Saudis’ feet clear out in months or years? It would be unwarranted, short-sighted, and pretentious to claim to have clear-cut answers to these questions. But if there is a certainty to the situation, it is this: Whatever happens next, Jamal Khashoggi’s murder will be part of how things unfold. Saudi Arabia’s brazen and miscalculated moves in planning and diverting from the Khashoggi affair have proven a game changer in regional politics.

Rabat – The Legatum Institute, an independent educational charity based in London, has ranked Morocco 103rd out of 149 countries on a global prosperity index. The country falls one place behind Tunisia and one above Tanzania.  Morocco ranks second highest in the Maghreb region after Tunisia, while ranking 9th in the Arab world. In Africa, Morocco falls behind Mauritius, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana, Rwanda, and Kenya.  Morocco dropped by 0.3 points out of 100 since last year to 55.4. Morocco dropped one place in the ranking and has steadily moved down the rankings by eight spots since the Prosperity Index began in 2006.  The index measures state performance on economic equality, business environment, governance, education, health, safety and security, personal freedom, social capital, and natural environment. Morocco scores highest in safety and security (81.66), ranking 45th globally. As for natural environment it scored 65.51 points, ranking 55th, while its lowest scores are in governance (38.7) and personal freedom (39.67). Morocco increased its score by 3 points in social capital since last year, while scoring 3 points lower in health. The five Maghreb countries have all ranked among the bottom 50 in the index, with Tunisia 102nd, Algeria 116th, Libya 133rd and Mauritania 142nd. The United Arab Emirates is the most prosperous country in the Arab world, according to the index.  Freedom House: Morocco is partially free In terms of internet freedom, the US-based Freedom House report touched upon several issues in Morocco,  such as freedom of the press and freedom on the net. The report noted the government’s crackdown on online news outlets and imprisoning of journalists and activists for their involvement in the Hirak protests in Al Hoceima. The report addressed the difficulty of creating a news website in Morocco, noting the partial freedom of the country.

Rabat – The Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI) conducted the study using data collected by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and published in Statistics Netherlands’ Annual Report on Integration 2018. The study also includes Dutch people of Turkish background. The study compares “first generation” Dutch people of Moroccan descent born in the 1980 to the “second generation” immigrants born in the 1990. One contrast between the two generations is that men and women in the older generation got married at a younger age, generally in their early 20s, whereas those born 10 years later are less likely to marry as young. The same applies for Turkish-Dutch people, as 31 percent of the first generation were married at 21. Among men and women of Turkish descent born in 1990, only 9 percent consider marrying young. The report noted a decline from 39 to 30 percent in the rate of Moroccans who married young. “Among 26-year-olds as well, the share of married people is still relatively low in the younger birth cohorts. A decline is seen among the Turkish second generation (from 55 to 38 percent) as well as the Moroccan second generation (from 39 to 30 percent),” stated CBS. Unlike their parents, Dutch-Moroccan young adults are less and less inclined towards marrying and having children at a young age. The same applies to their Dutch-Turkish peers. The report stated: “The share of 21-year-old mothers with native Dutch, Turkish or Moroccan background is significantly smaller among the cohort born in 1990 compared to those born in 1980.” Only 5 percent of Moroccan and Turkish women born in 1990 were already mothers at 21. Among Moroccan women born in 1980, 12 percent were married and had children at 21 while 16 percent of their Turkish peers had children at the same age. Second-generation Dutch people of Moroccan descent are more likely to marry someone from their same age group and from the Netherlands. The report notes that among second-generation Dutch-Moroccans married at 26, fewer had married Moroccans. The share of younger Dutch-Moroccans who married someone from Morocco declined from 70  to 29 percent compared to first-generation immigrants.

Rabat – Moroccan public sector doctors showed up to work on Wednesday wearing black to condemn working conditions in healthcare. After some doctors resigned en masse, and in response to a call by the Independent Union of Public Sector Doctors, Moroccan healthcare employees declared Wednesday a national day of mourning for the deplorable conditions in Moroccan healthcare. The doctors were also protesting the Ministry of Health’s lack of response to their concerns. Public health employees across Morocco—from Oujda, Tetouan, and Tangier in the north to Sale and Temara on the coast and Fez and Marrakech in the interior—put their usual white uniforms aside to protest an unsuitable working environment which they attribute to a lack of planning, poor governance, and insufficient funding. Zerhouni indicated that most health care facilities in Morocco lack the necessary equipment and infrastructure to meet the needs of Moroccan patients. In October, Moroccan doctors threatened to go overseas to seek better opportunities. The union issued a statement condemning the small percentage of the government’s budget dedicated to the health sector, the shutting down of many health centers,, the lack of infrastructure in many hospitals and health centers, and corruption and irregularities in many hospital centers across the country.

Rabat – The government is “intensifying efforts to become one of the 50 best economies in the world in terms of the quality of the business climate by 2021, by engaging in structural reforms of Moroccan business,” Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said Monday. El Othmani’s statements came in response to a question on “business climate reforms” during the monthly general policy session at the House of Representatives. Morocco jumped 9 places and ranked 60th out of 190 countries in the World Bank’s “Doing Business.” Improving its 2018 global ranking of 69th by nine places and two points, Morocco owes its score of 71.02 out of 100 to several new entrepreneurship-friendly policies. The North African country scored 67.91 points last year. Thanks to these reforms, Morocco ranked the second best country for doing business in the MENA region behind the United Arab Emirates and came third in Africa behind Mauritius and Rwanda. El Othmani explained that the state will promote international best practices in the business world, such as “simplification and digitization of administrative procedures, the modernization of the company’s legal and legislative frameworks, the universalization of the single portal as well as the improvement of benefits in their favor.” El Othmani also listed some important steps such as “reducing the cost of setting up a business through the exemption of registration fees; the facilitation of the transfer of ownership; the improvement of transparency in the land register and titling; simplification of export and import operations, and improvement of the infrastructure of Tangier-Med port.” To achieve Morocco’s strategic objective, the head of government affirmed that the national committee for business environment will implement the reforms programmed in the second part of the 2018-2021 action plan. In addition, El Othmani emphasized that an action plan will study all the indicators in the Doing Business report. According to the 2019 Doing Business report, released Wednesday, October 31, Morocco has made it easier to start a business by reducing registration fees, streamlining procedures to register property, and improving the system to resolve insolvency. “The achievements have allowed Morocco to occupy very advanced positions on a global scale concerning indicators related to granting building permits (18th), tax payment (25th), business creation (34th), connection to the electricity grid (59th), foreign trade (62nd), investor protection (64th), and ownership transfer (68th),” the head of government said.

Rabat – Daoudi made the remarks in a Parliament session Tuesday while comparing the number of jobs the current government has facilitated to those of previous governments.  He asserted, “El Othmani’s government managed to create 130,000 job opportunities within 3 years, while the government of Jettou created only 40,000 jobs.” He continued, “El Fassi’s government created 71,000 jobs, while the number jumped to 116,000 under Benkirane.” Daoudi optimistically responded to MPs’ questions that criticized the country’s situation, saying, “Morocco will overtake Italy in car production, because Morocco produces 400,000 cars, and in 2020 and 2021 the figure will jump to 700,000 which surpasses what this European country produces.” Morocco is striving to become an automotive hub. The efforts bore fruit when Morocco surpassed South Africa’s car production numbers in 2017. Morocco produced 345,000 passenger vehicles over South Africa’s 331,000.   According to the government’s figures, the automotive sector was the first exporting sector in the Moroccan economy to earn MAD 50 billion in revenue in 2017. The sector aims to double the figure by 2020. Daoudi also said he would set a limit on oil companies’ profits if they do not reduce prices.  “Oil prices are falling, and at the end of the month this should be reflected in Morocco. If prices do not fall, price regulation is the solution,” Daoudi responded to one MP’s question on Tuesday evening. Daoudi is expected to meet with fuel company executives today to discuss a legal framework for fuel prices. Concerning the inflation wave in Morocco, especially in vegetables and fruits, Daoudi said that purchasing power will improve when the economy grows. He pointed out that the government is trying to integrate Moroccans into the labor market. High fuel prices have significantly impacted the cost of living. Prices on some basic commodities jumped notably affecting the quality of life for the average Moroccan. Since the government deregulated fuel prices under Abdelilah Benkirane’s government in December 2015, which coincided with record lows in oil prices globally, Moroccans have continued to complain about the rise in cost of living. Moroccans have expressed their discontent in multiple ways. They protested in front of Parliament and boycotted three prominent companies selling fuel, bottled water, and dairy.  Recently, freight drivers went on a 10-day strike in more than 70 provinces across Morocco demanding the reduction of fuel prices and the raising of the legal tonnage threshold. Drivers were also upset that the government imposed a training requirement costing MAD 4,000-8,000 earlier this year. Although fuel prices have dropped by a few centimes, the price of a barrel of oil (158.98 liters) has dropped to $52 from a high of $81. Some attribute the high fuel prices to the government’s fuel taxes.

Rabat – The 23-year-old was prosecuted for carrying out five armed robberies near Turnhout, Belgium, on December 31, 2017, New Year’s Eve, and on January 6, 2018. H’Maidat and his accomplice stole cash from betting shops, a supermarket, and a gas station. He must  serve at least 20 months before he is eligible for parole. On March 13,  police arrested him through tracing CCTV footage, license plate recognition, and a search of phone records. H’Maidat begin his senior football career with Anderlecht in 2014 before heading to Italy to sign with Brescia the following year and then with Roma in 2016. Since this time, he was transferred  to two Italian clubs while on loan before joining Portuguese club Olhanense. The footballer has been a notorious  troublemaker. His latest club, Westerlo, fired him in January 2018 for outrageous behavior off the pitch. The midfielder reportedly earns £9,000 a month, and was transferred to Roma for £3.5 million in 2016. H’Maidat made his first international appearance with Morocco’s national football team in 2016, with a friendly 4-0 win over Canada in October of the same year.

Rabat – After the 2019 Finance Bill stipulated an increase in the domestic consumption tax on certain cigarette brands, the SMT said it assented the state move. On Wednesday, daily newspaper Aujourd’hui le Maroc quoted  company officials as saying: “The SMT fully adheres to the administration’s desire to improve tax revenues, through a relevant and studied reform of provisions relating to the domestic consumption tax related to this product.” The tobacco companies in Morocco reportedly doubted the seriousness of the  2019 Finance Bill analysis, which, according to them, will aid in creating a market for  the smuggled tobacco. The SMT officials emphasized the importance of protecting the country’s producers in developing the tax system, similar to many countries around the world. The tax increase will affect the most widely-consumed cigarettes on the market: Marlboro and Marquise. Marlboro packs will be sold for MAD 40 instead of MAD 33, and Marquise for MAD 21 instead of MAD 19. According to Article 5 of the 2019 Finance Bill, the minimum tax rate will increase from MAD 567 to MAD 630 per 1,000 cigarettes, while the minimum tax burden will increase from 53.6 percent to 58 percent. Morocco received MAD 10.48 billion from the domestic consumption tax in 2017, up from MAD 9.86 billion in 2016, according to customs administration. In October, Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun stated that the bill’s increase of taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue, estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019. The 2019 Finance Bill also included raising domestic consumption taxes on shisha tobacco from MAD 350 to MAD 450 per kilogram. On November 11, the finance committee voted on the first part of the 2019 finance draft bill by adopting 56 amendments, including raising domestic consumption taxes by 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks with high sugar levels.

Washington D.C – When a Saudi press release announced MBS, the Saudi crown prince, would embark on a world tour of North African countries, many wondered why Morocco was not on the list. Rumors had it that MBS was snubbing Morocco for not supporting Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Qatar.  A few days later, a number of news outlets, such as Al Quds and Lakome, suggested that it was King Mohammed VI who refused to receive the Saudi crown prince. The news was confirmed to MWN by a government source familiar with the subject.  King Mohammed VI’s decision to abstain from receiving MBS is a step in the right direction. With this decision and the decision to remain neutral in the Gulf crisis, Morocco is moving progressively towards adopting a foreign policy that is far removed from the strategic calculations—or rather miscalculations—of the Saudi crown prince. The time when Rabat used to say that what harms the Saudis harms Moroccans may have become history. It was both striking and heartening to see that Morocco was among the few Arab countries that issued no statement of support for MBS after the backlash caused by his apparent involvement in the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Morocco is not a vassal state, and it should not accept being used in Mohamed bin Salman’s attempt to regain international recognition and legitimacy after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  One does not just decide to make an official visit to a sovereign state overnight or on a whim. It usually takes several weeks and months to organize a high level visit of this kind and define the agenda and the agreements, if any, to be signed. The international context of the visit and its short notice indicate that Mohammed bin Salman is simply seeking to rehabilitate himself on the global stage, regain some sort of legitimacy and assure his supporters that he is still able to carry out his economic and political agenda.  Such a visit would not bring any benefit to Morocco. The Saudis must understand that Morocco has its own strategic interests to take into account, and Morocco should not offer blanket support for any foreign policy decision the Saudis take.   Despite the silence of the two countries and the publication from time to time of communiques from both capitals in which they stress the strong traditional ties that bind them, there is no doubt that their relations are going through their worst period in the past six decades. MBS’ rapid ascension to power and his impulsiveness seem to have upended the traditional understanding and cordial relations between the capitals. The Saudi crown prince, known for his recklessness and total lack of experience, simply expects Morocco to blindly follow every foreign policy decision he makes, even if it runs contrary to Rabat’s strategic interests.  Saudi Arabia’s brazen decision to support the US-led World Cup 2026 bid and its behind-the-scenes efforts to convince other Arab and Asian countries to vote against Morocco was a clear reminder that it was no longer business as usual with Saudi Arabia. The understanding and mutual respect that used to govern their bilateral relations have waned. Saudi Arabia would be misguided to think that because it grants Morocco financial aid—less than $300 million annually—Morocco should be beholden to it and support all its foreign policy decisions. Saudi Arabia has so far failed to fulfill to its commitment to grant Morocco $1.25 billion as part of the financial package that Gulf countries decided to provide Morocco between 2012 and 2016. While Qatar and Kuwait fulfilled their pledges, Saudi Arabia has, as of August 2018, disbursed only $868 million.  The inconsequential financial aid Saudi Arabia provides comes in exchange for the continuous military and diplomatic support Rabat has provided over the years. For instance, Morocco moved to sever its diplomatic ties with Iran in 2009 and expressed solidarity with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia after Tehran questioned the Sunni rule in Manama.  Morocco was also at the forefront of countries that provided their support for the Saudi-led coalition to oust the Houthi rebels from Yemen and restore the authority of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. In the first months of the conflict, Moroccans mourned the death of a Moroccan pilot, Yassine Bahti, who died while fighting alongside the Saudis. The Yemen war and the crimes that the Saudi military has been committing against the Yemeni people have left a stain on Morocco’s reputation at the global level. The UN named Morocco in a report released in October 2017 which blacklisted the Saudi-led coalition for killing and injuring 683 Yemeni children and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals in 2016.  Morocco should build on the experience of Egypt. While it has received $25 billion in financial aid from the Saudis since 2014, Egypt has not necessarily espoused all the foreign policy decisions dictated by the Saudis. In Yemen, the Egyptians have refused to provide troops, and in Syria, Egypt supported President Bashar Al-Assad although Saudi Arabia had turned the toppling of the Syrian president into the core of its foreign policy in Syria since 2011.  Moving forward, every overture towards Saudi Arabia should be based on what Morocco will receive in exchange for it. The Saudis should no longer take Morocco for granted nor see it as their backyard. Morocco is a sovereign state that has its own interests and agenda. The bilateral relations between the two countries should be based on a win-win partnership, mutual respect and support. Morocco should make clear, now more than ever, that its foreign policy decisions are based on its own calculations and strategic interests and that it cannot be expected to continue providing blanket support for another state’s foreign policy decisions.

Rabat – Emirati Ambassador in Rabat Salem Al Kaabi conveyed a message from the UAE president during the symposium on “Sheikh Zayed and his role in building relations between the United Arab Emirates and Morocco,” which opened on Tuesday in Rabat. In his message, Al-Nahyan said that his country rejects “any attack on the security, stability of Morocco.” He added that the UAE backs all measures taken by Morocco to face the challenges that threaten its integrity. The president said the UAE is determined to consolidate the distinguished relations between the two countries. He noted that the two countries maintain “fraternal and solid” ties founded by King Hassan II and the late Sheikh Zayed. “Thanks to their patriotic conscience and their strong will, the [late leaders], peace to their souls, have managed to lay the foundations of a fruitful cooperation and a strategic partnership, one that is exemplary and privileged relations, which drew from their strength of spiritual rapprochement and a convergence of positions and interests as well as an unshakeable faith in the community of language, religion, civilization and destiny,” he said. The UAE president echoed a similar message addressed by King Mohammed VI to the participants of the symposium. In his message, the King said that the symposium aims to celebrate the “longstanding relationship” between the two countries. He also recalled Morocco’s pride over the relations uniting the two royal families. The UAE has long supported Morocco’s territorial integrity. In October, the Gulf country reiterated support for Morocco’s cause at the 4th Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The country also supports Morocco’s autonomy plan, which it deems as serious and credible to move towards an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – Speaking at Tuesday’s parliamentary session, Morocco’s Minister Delegate to the Minister of the Interior Noureddine Boutayeb said that a parliamentary meeting in October set a series of measures to help Moroccans cope with the season’s temperature drops. Increasing the number of people benefitting from the Riaya plan in more rural and mountainous areas hit by heavy snowfall was at the heart of the meeting. The meeting added Khemisset, El Hajeb, Oujda, and Jerada—, near the border with Algeria, to the national plan. The aid includes blankets, firewood, and foodstuffs for the 27 provinces. At the request of King Mohammed VI, the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) will set up field hospitals in Ouaouizerth, a small rural town in Azilal Province, and the village of Anfgou in the Midelt Province. The Riaya plan will also provide shelter and care for homeless people, and supply blankets for orphanages, boarding schools, and hospitals. It will plow snow off the roads in collaboration with the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics. The early snowfalls beginning late in October in the Atlas Mountains towns and cities of Azrou, Midelt, Boulemane, Taza, El Hajeb, Imouzzer, and Ifrane took the country by surprise, especially because the annual cold weather plan had not yet been fully implemented. Despite the early snow, roads blocked with snow were no surprise. Increasing complaints about the lack of snow removal equipment followed the death of a shepherd who went missing in heavy snow in Taza in the Atlas Mountains. The shepherd had been missing for a week and was found frozen under layers of snow.  Early in November, King Mohammed VI gave instructions to the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity to mobilize in order to face the significant temperature drops forecasted across Morocco. The foundation carried out a medical campaign in the town of Boumia, located in the Midelt Province in the Draa-Tafilalet region. The campaign offers medical services, including general medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, maternal health, dentistry, ophthalmology, biology, radiology, and screening for physical disability in order to manufacture the appropriate equipment, according to the statement.

Rabat – The conference aims to discuss issues included in the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” including economic and social development, environmental sustainability, and water conservation.  Mouhcine Jazouli, Moroccan minister delegate for African integration, and Peter Munya, Kenyan minister of industry, trade, and cooperatives met Tuesday to discuss bilateral trade relations.  “With an ambitious and forward-looking Royal Vision for Africa, Morocco has launched an unprecedented momentum on the continent that has earned it the position of Africa’s second largest investor on the continent, with over 60% of its [foreign investments directed] to Africa, and allowed a presence of Moroccan companies in 40 of the 54 African countries,” said Jazouli during the meeting.  Peter Munya expressed willingness to strengthen economic relations with Morocco by promoting bilateral exchanges and trade.  According to data from the Moroccan Exchange Office, the 2017 trade balance between Morocco and Kenya was approximately MAD 262.82 million. Morocco exported MAD 157.02 million worth of resources to Kenya, while its Kenyan imports amounted to MAD 99.04 million at the end of 2017. Agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and engineering and construction are Morocco’s largest exports to Kenya.

Rabat – Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs Khemaies Jhinaoui said in an interview with Tunisian news outlet Assabah News that his country is continuing “efforts with the leaders of neighboring [countries] Morocco and Algeria to turn the page of Arab and regional bilateral differences, including the Moroccan-Algerian conflict.” He added that his country “suggested specified dates” for closed meetings to convene the foreign ministers of the Maghreb countries. The Tunisian official welcomed King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer to Algeria. He also appreciated Algeria’s proposal which called on an Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) meeting of foreign ministers. The two initiatives, according to the Tunisian official, “may contribute to the operationalization” of Maghreb relations at the bilateral and regional collective levels, “in order to turn the old page” of conflicts between Morocco and Algeria. Mauritania also expressed its intention to host the meeting of the AMU’s foreign ministers. Nouakchott also said that it is open to all “initiatives that contribute to the revitalization of the institutions of the Arab Maghreb” to meet the expectations of its people. On November 6, King Mohammed VI condemned the “division” and lack of cooperation between the countries of the Maghreb, including the absent diplomatic ties between Morocco and Algeria. The King also said that Morocco is open to any initiative to break the stalemate between the two countries. He added that such regional conflicts hamper the process of Maghreb construction and unity. The monarch also called for a “mechanism of dialogue and consultation” based on frank and direct dialogue between the two countries.

Rabat – On Friday, November 23, Tunisia made history when it became the first government in the Arab world to approve equality in inheritance law, allowing men and women the same share in terms of inheritance. But not everyone in the Arab world is happy with Tunisia’s move. In response to what he called “a controversial decision,” Egypt’s grand mufti, Dr. Shawki Allam, issued a statement on Monday, November 26, that harshly condemned the Tunisian government’s stance. Dr. Allam explained that equality in inheritance for both genders is contrary to the Qur’an’s prescriptions on the matter. Sharia, the Islamic law deriving from both the Qur’an and the hadith (prophetic tradition), should not be subject to personal interpretation or reasoning (ijtihad), the Egyptian mufti said.  Sensitive topics in Islam, including inheritance, have been clearly dealt with in the Qur’an and the Islamic tradition (sunnah), the statement said. In addition to upending the Islamic tradition, pushing for equality for genders also disrupts the “transmitted consensus of scholars.” “The call for equality in inheritance between genders contradicts both the definitive rulings of Shariah Law and the successively transmitted consensus of scholars…. Therefore, they are not subject to ijtihad (interpretation) or change due to cultural contexts.” “In Shari’ah,” the mufti’s statement added, “males are entitled to inherit double the females’ shares only in four cases. Both genders, on the other hand, inherit equally in more than 30 cases.” The Egyptian mufti is not the only one angered by the Tunisian government’s move. The mufti’s admonishment falls in line with complaints within Tunisia’s conservative circles. Following conservative lines, Ennahda, Tunisia’s largest party in Parliament, has been particularly critical of the government’s sweeping reforms in gender equality.  Prior to the equal inheritance law, Tunisia passed a bill in September 2017 that granted Tunisian women the right to marry non-Muslim men.  Like the Egyptian mufti, Ennahda and its Tunisian supporters have argued against changing “the obligations that God has revealed in his holy book.” Meanwhile, supportive voices in Tunisia, the Arab world, and globally have welcomed the current Tunisian regime’s boldly progressive reforms since it ascended to power. They argue that, like with the Arab Spring which erupted in Tunisia and spread to many countries in the region, Tunisia may inspire other countries to follow suit with more rights-based and religion-free laws. While approved by the government and endorsed by President Beji Caid Essebsi, the equal inheritance proposal will have to pass through committee and plenary session debates in the Tunisian Parliament before taking effect.

Rabat – Afghanistan is not seeing gains in its war, an armed conflict that has raged for the past 17 years. The violence continued Friday, when an explosive killed nine at a mosque in an Afghan army base in Khost province. The attack is part of a trend with the Taliban beginning to intensify combat against coalition forces. Since the Afghan army assumed control of the war in 2015, approximately 20 Afghan soldiers have been killed each day, said President Ashraf Ghani.  Lack of control by the federal government is also affecting the Afghan army’s ability to find willing recruits. The Special Inspector General for the Reconstruction (SIGAR) of Afghanistan released a report showing the number of police and military personnel fell by 9,000 compared to last year. Afghans are showing signs of fatigue from the two-decade war, and as the US begins pulling out from the area, more territory is falling back into Taliban control. Taliban forces are reportedly better equipped than any point during the American intervention in Afghanistan. A report revealed that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, the force planning to take control after the US exit, is marked by widespread corruption, desertion, and extremely low morale. According to the Washington Post, in a fight earlier in the year, many Afghan troops cut deals with the Taliban, abandoning their posts before combat started.  The Taliban’s success is highlighting flaws in the US’s policy in Afghanistan. The failure to adapt to Taliban strategies continues into the Trump administration. The US adopted a strategy of placing coalition forces mostly in the urban areas of Afghanistan. The strategy gives control over the major population centers, but it enables the Taliban to rule unchecked in the country, with statistics from SIGAR estimating the Taliban control about 56% of Afghan districts. The Taliban appear to be winning the current waiting game they are playing with the Afghan government and the US. The group realizes they cannot win against a US-supported coalition, but with US troops being focused elsewhere, and an underprepared Afghan replacement, the Taliban are likely to begin upping the ante to gain influence in the country as the coalition pulls out.

Rabat – While in Saudi Arabia for a conference on October 24, Bongo suffered a stroke and spent nearly a month at King Faisal Hospital in Riyadh.   In a Facebook post, Bongo’s wife, Sylvia Bongo Ondimba, announced that the president’s health has improved and expressed gratitude to the Saudi authorities and medical staff at the hospital. She wrote: “To pursue his recovery, the president, consulting his close family members, has made the decision to accept the proposal of his brother, His Majesty the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI … My husband will arrive tomorrow in Rabat, the capital.” International media previously reported that King Mohammed VI “managed to convince” Bongo’s family to transfer him to Morocco instead of London. According to his wife, Bongo has also asked his advisers to join him in Rabat to discuss his country’s affairs in line with his extended absence. Gabon’s Vice-President Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou had already taken over in Bongo’s absence to handle Gabon’s affairs. The Constitutional Court had resolved to authorize Moussavou to chair the Council of Ministers and handle urgent matters and “ensure the continuity of the State and the public service, as well as the regular functioning of the government,” Africanews reported. Bongo has visited Morocco several times. King Mohammed VI and the Gabonese president share a good relationship.  In 2017, Bongo shared a picture of himself and King Mohammed VI as teenagers, demonstrating the long-standing friendship between them.

By Trista Youssef In a video released on Sunday, Professor He Jiankui claimed responsibility for the birth of genetically modified twins resistant to HIV. The video sparked an investigation from Chinese health authorities.  Gene editing is illegal in most countries because its effects are largely unpredictable. DNA alterations can potentially harm future generations, causing mutations and disease. If He’s claims are true, his human experiment poses a scientific and ethical controversy.  Although gene editing has recently been used to treat adults with fatal diseases, gene editing on embryos has more potential to be dangerous. DNA alterations in adults are confined to that one person, while genetic modification of embryos can be inherited by future generations, having unpredictable effects for the entire gene pool.  Professor Julian Savulescu, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, called He’s experiment “monstrous.”  “Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,” said Savulescu.  In a joint statement, more than 120 Chinese scientists criticised the experient as “madness,” calling on authorities to ban the activity and enforce ethical guidelines. Chinese lawyers and HIV researchers have also publicly denounced He’s research.  Professor He defended his work, stating that the participants in his experiment “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.” The goal of He’s gene alteration was to make HIV-resistant DNA for babies with parents suffering from the disease.  “I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If the DNA editing has harmful effects in the future, He said, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”

Rabat – Police arrested the 29-year-old man in July 2017 for abusing his former partner. A judge sought a second arrest warrant following an investigation when his name was found in the black list of foreign ISIS fighters.  Italian police said Benhamir had received “the call” to action and was awaiting instructions on how to carry out terror acts for ISIS. At sentencing yesterday, the ISIS-linked suspect did not appear in person but was connected by video conference. Benhamir is believed to be an ISIS member who returned to Italy from Syria to train other ISIS members to make explosives, reported Italian outlet Giustizia News24.   Italian news outlets reported that the police investigation found instructions for how to ignite explosives with old cell phones, one of which was in the man’s possession when he was arrested. Europol, the FBI, and the Dutch police cooperated in the investigation.

Rabat – Morocco imposed a permanent anti-dumping duty of 11 percent on the Turkish hot-rolled coils in August 2014. Turkey contested the duty in October 2016.

A WTO panel issued its ruling in late October. The ruling noted that the Moroccan government had violated the trade body’s regulations when it established dumping margins on the Turkish steel mills of Colakoglu Metalurji and Erdemir. Morocco, like Turkey, had 60 days to appeal the organization’s decision. The WTO said Friday, November 23, that Morocco had appealed. The dispute between Rabat and Ankara arose in 2013 when the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy took some anti-dumping measures against hot-rolled coils imported from Turkey.

Rabat – An official on Princess Astrid of Belgium’s trade delegation has said Morocco’s position as gateway to Africa could benefit Antwerp and Zeebrugge. Princess Astrid and several Belgian politicians met, as part of their diplomatic mission, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and foreign minister Nasser Bourita in Rabat on Tuesday. El Othmani and Princess Astrid recognized that there are opportunities to boost economic cooperation between Morocco and Belgium. During the meeting, El Othmani emphasized “the particular interest that Morocco grants” to its partners by opening up its economy to the outside, according to a statement from his department. “We want to strengthen cultural, human and economic ties with Belgium,” Othmani said after the meeting. “We have the ambition to strengthen relations, not only between Belgium and Morocco, but also (to go) a step further, in an African context.” Belgian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Didier Reynders said, “We have extensive cultural and historical ties, but the economic potential is much greater than what is achieved today,” he said. He noted that a community of more than 500,000 people of Moroccan origin live in Belgium, Belgian magazine Le Vif reported. Moroccan-Belgian trade still limited Flemish Minister-President Geert Bourgeois stated, “Trade relations with Morocco are still too limited.” He noted that Flanders accounts for 86-87 percent of Belgian exports to the North African country. “But we are only talking about 771 million euros,” he said. “But we both have more to offer,” he said. in the first six months of 2018, Belgium exported €439.3 million worth of goods to Morocco, representing a 2 percent increase over the same period of 2017. Imports of Moroccan products to Belgium dropped to €172 million, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Morocco is Belgium’s 44th biggest export destination and its 61st import supplier, according to the Belgian Agency for Foreign Trade. The agency estimated exports of Belgian companies to Morocco at €889.7 million and imports at €332.8 million in 2017. Morocco, according to Bourgeois, is investing not only in conventional infrastructure but also in many other sectors where Flemish companies excel, such as renewable energies and water purification.  Bourgeois went to Kenitra, north of Rabat, where the Waterleau company built a wastewater treatment plant. The Belgian delegation also attended the presentation of a wind turbine project of the Belgian-Dutch company WindVision. Bourgeois said that Morocco is increasingly presenting itself as a gateway to Africa, an evolution that could benefit the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge. El Othmani boasts of Morocco’s improving business climate  During the meeting, El Othmani spoke about Morocco’s achievements in improving its business climate and investment promotion.  Morocco jumped 9 places and ranked 60th in the World Bank’s “Doing Business” 2019 report out of 190 countries. Morocco aims to be among the top 50 countries in the Doing Business rankings by 2021, El Othmani stressed. Morocco’s efforts have positively impacted the flow of foreign direct investment, which has improved significantly, added the prime minister. Reynders stressed the reforms that Morocco is undertaking and which should lead to stability. “I am very happy to see Morocco evolve,” and that Belgians could contribute to Morocco’s stability, he said. The Belgian foreign minister cited the example of the consortium of the Belgian group Besix and the Moroccan construction company of Casablanca (TGCC), which were assigned last month to design and construct what is to be Africa’s tallest tower, Mohammed VI Tower, in Rabat. Princess Astrid is currently on a business visit to Morocco at the head of a large Belgian delegation of 460 businessmen, entrepreneurs, and ministers. El Othmani noted that the Belgian delegation involves representatives of many sectors, particularly chemistry, renewable energy, transport and logistics, and health. The delegation members will hold meetings with Moroccan businessmen to establish “fruitful partnerships,” he added. The official trip, which will continue until November 30, aims to boost trade between the two countries. The delegation will conclude the visit with a signing ceremony for a series of agreements and memoranda of understanding.

Rabat – in an statement to Morocco World News, the Moroccan ambassador confirmed that Algeria did not invite Morocco’s embassy to take part in the event, contradicting Algeria’s story. Yesterday, Algerian news outlet Al Hiwar reported that Algerian Minister of Environment Fatima Zahrae Zerouati said that Morocco’s choice to be absent “has nothing to do with diplomatic issues” between the two countries. Although the original article which quoted the minister is no longer accessible, the statement of the Algerian official was quoted by Al3omk.ma. Zerouati also claimed that the absence was a “protocol” move. The ambassador told MWN that the embassy never received an invitation. “You cannot attend a meeting without being invited,” he added. The Algerian state-owned news agency APS reported that “Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia held a meeting in Algiers Tuesday … to prepare for accidental marine pollution in the south-west Mediterranean and to prepare for this type of major pollution.” Several other Algerian news outlets also reported that the Moroccan ambassador attended the meeting. Lies or ignorance? The Algerian minister may have explained Morocco’s absence from the meeting without being aware that the Moroccan embassy did not receive an invitation in the first place. At a time when Morocco has extended a hand to Algeria for more cooperation, it would be odd to refuse to attend the meeting. The government and Moroccan political parties have been calling their Algerian counterparts to engage in direct dialogue to restore diplomatic ties between the two countries for the interests of the two peoples. The parties’ offers were in line with King Mohammed VI’s offer in his speech on the anniversary of the Green March on November 6. Requesting more talks with Algeria, the King said that the diplomatic issues between the two countries require a “joint political mechanism of dialogue and consultation.” Despite the traditional congratulatory messages that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and King Mohammed VI exchange on holidays, Morocco and Algeria have cold diplomatic bonds. The King acknowledged the unhealthy relations between the two countries which do not help the Maghreb unity project. Despite the firm determination of the royal dialogue initiative, Algeria did not officially react to the proposal. In response, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated the King’s offer and called on Bouteflika’s government to respond to the Moroccan dialogue initiative. In an indirect response, Algeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement last week, calling for an urgent meeting of the foreign ministers at the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU). However, Morocco said that the statement was “unrelated” to the Moroccan dialogue initiative.

The 46-year-old woman flew from Sao Paulo, Brazil, to Casablanca, and police took her into custody shortly after she landed, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN).  Authorities immediately took the Angolan woman to Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center for further medical examination, both to monitor her well-being and to recover any further amounts of cocaine she possessed. Sometimes, those carrying drugs, called “mules,” ingest the drugs in tiny capsules to avoid detection, posing a significant health risk to the drug mule if the capsules rupture.  Morocco is attempting to fight an increasing flow of cocaine originating from South America. Earlier this year, the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced that it seized a 541 kilogram shipment originating from Brazil and bound for Casablanca, according to Maghreb Arab Press. Police in Rabat made history by seizing 2.4 metric tons in 2017, the largest amount of cocaine ever confiscated in Morocco’s history.  As a result of more stringent drug interdiction efforts in the US, Latin American drug cartels like the Sinaloa and Los Zetas are beginning to move drugs through Africa and Europe instead. The drugs usually arrive in coastal port cities in North and West Africa and are then transported across the Mediterranean to Europe. The traffickers view this route as much safer than attempting to transport the drugs across the heavily-watched US-Mexico border.  Morocco, in particular, is an attractive target and geographical location for drug traffickers. The short trip across the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain allows drug dealers to quickly access European markets. Often, mules are economically disadvantaged people from developing nations in Africa, making it hard for investigators to eliminate the top figures in drug operations. In this year alone, Moroccan police arrested a Lithuanian man with about 8.5 kilograms of cocaine, a Frenchman with 3 kilograms, and a woman from Sierra Leone with 1.5 kilograms, all at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport.

Rabat – He spoke in a message to the participants of the symposium “Sheikh Zayed and his role in building relations between the United Arab Emirates and Morocco,” which opened on Tuesday in Rabat. In his message, the King touted the special bonds uniting the two countries. The King said that “the two sister nations – the Kingdom of Morocco and the United Arab Emirates – have every reason to celebrate this event.” The symposium, held at the initiative of the King, aimed to celebrate the “longstanding relationship” founded by King Hassan II and the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The sovereign recalled his father’s pride in the bonds, saying that the two nations “were like twins, separated only by geography.” The King is also satisfied with the UAE’s royal family and their loyalty towards the bonds “uniting them to my family as well as to the Kingdom of Morocco.” Speaking about the roles of both late leaders, the Moroccan monarch recalled his father’s commitment and aim to build “the Maghreb Union because it was a strategic choice and a popular demand.” He added that King Hassan II’s strategy was to “achieve comprehensive development, integration and complementary.” The strategy of King Hassan II was reiterated in King Mohammed VI’s speech on November 6 for the Green March anniversary. In his speech, the King expressed concerns about the “division” and lack of cooperation between Maghreb countries due to regional conflicts. To ensure more unity, the King extended his hand to Algeria with a dialogue offer to normalize diplomatic ties and help unite the Arab Maghreb. The UAE was among the countries that backed Morocco’s dialogue initiative. The Gulf country also supports Morocco’s territorial integrity. In May, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita met his counterpart Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan in Abu Dhabi and said that Morocco and the UAE have unique and strong ties. The UAE is also Morocco’s second largest trading partner in the Gulf region, and Morocco’s third largest investor. Emirati investment projects include oil, telecommunications, renewable energy, and phosphates, he said. An estimated 5,000 Moroccans live in the UAE, half of whom have settled in the country over the last four years as a result of increased employment opportunities in Abu Dhabi, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Satisfied with the diplomatic ties, King Mohammed VI concluded his message, saying that Morocco and the UAE will continue their joint action to “promote these exemplary relations in the best way to show loyalty to the special relationship that existed between Sheikh Zayed and Hassan II—may God bless their souls.”

By Shaquile Goff The new Casablanca hotel is slated to be built near the Casa Port Train Station. It will also be located near the Art Deco and business districts of the city. The world-renowned Jaime Bernstein designed the hotel’s interior. Radisson plans to cater to the varying groups of people traveling through the diverse city with a 456 square meter executive meeting space, a spa center, bar, lounge, and a signature restaurant. Ramsay Rankoussi, Radisson’s vice president of development in the Middle East and North Africa, released a statement saying, “Morocco is a key market for us as the number one tourism destination in Africa, in terms of foreign arrivals, and Casablanca represents not only the heart of the Moroccan economy but also the continent as it was recently announced as the number one financial hub in Africa.” The announcement comes as Morocco sees a continued increase in tourism, and businesses begin to see the potential for profit. Morocco’s tourism rate reportedly jumped about 8 percent in the first three-quarters of 2018 from the same period last year. Tourists from around the world visit Morocco, and several well-known European and American hospitality chains are beginning to show more interest in opening hotels in the country.  With other famous luxury hotel names like Four Seasons, Hyatt, and Sofitel already present in the city, Radisson hopes to take advantage of an emerging market and add “Radisson” to the growing list of Western hotels dominating the Casablanca skyline. Radisson announced the plans during the Africa Hotel Investment Forum last month in Nairobi, Kenya. The forum is an annual event that promotes connections between global investors and entrepreneurs to develop more hospitality businesses on the continent.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasna, King Mohammed VI’s sister, as chairwoman of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection, received the sustainable development doctorate.  In a ceremony at the university campus in Kyoto, the princess expressed pride in the honorary degree granted for her efforts for the environment and sustainable development.

Rabat – The CEO made his remarks while speaking to French outlet France 24 on Friday, November 23. The businessman argued that decision-making in the most crucial sectors for Algerian socio-economic life now lies with a circle close to the ailing president. “An invisible hand is ruling Algeria,” Rebrab said, explaining that “the president is not even aware” of the most “worrying developments” the country has been experiencing of late. “An invisible hand is governing Algeria… The invisible hand astonishes everyone and is the source of all the obstructions facing investments in the country. I don’t think President Bouteflika knows about this obstruction.” For the Algerian businessman, a circle of old-school politicians, technocrats, and billionaires have taken grip of the country’s political power and economic resources. While the ruling elite wishes to maintain its dominance on Algerian political life, the country’s economic situation worsens daily. The North African country is going through a dire crisis that heralds more serious and worse social, political, and economic issues if current leadership succeeds in keeping political momentum. “The economic situation is untenable,” he said. While Algeria’s economy essentially depends on oil, the fluctuating and unstable global market for oil means that “Algeria must diversify its economy.” Economic diversification would require a change in leadership priorities. Rather than buy public support and voters’ sympathy by distributing oil revenue, Algerian authorities should invest more in making room for “profound, urgent, and radical reforms needed to uplift the country from its worrying situation.” But who is governing Algeria? And why is Bouteflika keen to run for another term if he is no longer the one in charge? And, perhaps more importantly, what would it take to diversify Algeria’s oil-dependent economy and embrace the new economic model which Algeria observers and analysts have been proposing? The hidden hand, Rebrab explained, boils down to a circle of technocrats and billionaires who are doing everything in their power to contain and prevent change. “Ninety-95 percent of Algerians want things to change. Only the remaining 5-10 percent wants things to remain as they are because they take huge benefits off the rentier system.” Rebrab’s remarks come after the publication on November 19 of a detailed study on Algeria’s current economic situation. Like Rebrab, the study spoke of Algeria in ominous terms. Politically paralyzed and economically unstable, Algeria is on the verge of deep crises should reforms not be made, the study predicted.

Rabat – Baibanou announced her determination to climb the mountain, which is the last summit of the “Seven Summit” challenge at a press conference. It will take the Moroccan mountaineer ten days to reach her destination, as the massive mountain is  21 kilometer long and 13 kilometer wide. The mountain lies within the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains. During the press conference, Baibanou stated  that her message is “to prove that dreams can come true [if you] just believe in it and have the will.” She added: “With a lot of perseverance [and] determination, I am pursuing my dream to climb Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica, and to be the first in Morocco to realize the ‘Seven Summits’ challenge.”  Baibanou also succeed to reach the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest, in 2017. Like Baibanou, several other Moroccan women are passionate about hiking mountains. Last year in May,  Ghizlane Aakar waved the Moroccan flag from Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.  In an interview with Outdoor Women Alliance, the 47-year-old mountaineer said after her Everest achievement, “people [in Morocco] accept women doing adventure sports. It wasn’t like before. Women can do everything now. I feel lucky to be a Moroccan woman.”

The world has criticized the government in western China’s so-called “re-education camps” targeting the Uighur ethnicity that mostly live in Xinjiang province, sometimes referred to as Chinese Turkestan. The mass detention of Uighur Muslims, and bans on certain Islamic rites and clothing, in the name of re-education and “de-extremification” of the Muslim minorities have made international headlines. To the community, the case remains somewhat forgotten by journalists from Muslim countries. “Muslim countries have economic and political interests, that is why official news outlets pay no mind to this case. That is why scholars and organizations must at least deliver this message to all muslims,” a man representing the community said in the video. The speaker emphasized that the case of Uighur Muslims is that of “right and justice.”  He stated: “[W]e, Muslims, in a short period, have become vulnerable to cruelty, persecution, murder, and a ban on Islamic religious practices.” In recent days, China has even issued a statement saying that any Muslims who think alcohol, cigarettes, or dancing are “haram” (forbidden) need to turn themselves in. The speaker in the video also stated: “When we tell Muslim people that China prohibits Muslim in eastern Turkestan from praying, fasting, going to Hajj pilgrimage, giving Zakat mandatory charity, and from following the Sharia dress code for women and long beards for men, many of them do not believe us and say that we have trouble with the government.” The man suggested that Muslims outside China, organizations, scholars, or activists send a delegation to investigate the condition of Muslims in the region if they did not believe in the persecution practised against them. The son of an elderly scholar who shed tears in the video was allegedly killed, and 40 of the scholar’s children and grandchildren have been detained.  “It’s been more than two years and we still do not know what happened to our families,  whether they are alive or dead, because they have prohibited us from contacting them,” the speaker said. More than one million Uighurs are currently being held in “re-education camps,” with allegedly no contact with their families, according to a United Nations report. Sending a plea for the Muslim world, the man stated that if none could help Uighur Muslims “directly,” they could “at least pray” for their Muslim brothers. The Chinese government has defended the use of camps by stating that the prisoners are also able to take occupational classes on topics such as hairdressing or commerce. Their purpose is mainly to remove possibilities of extremism and terrorism in the country. Many media outlets and activists around the world claim that the camps are in fact a means to strip the Uighur Muslims of their identity.

Rabat – HRW said that it filed its request with Ariel Lijo, a  federal judge in Argentina, on Monday. The request might lead MbS to change his plans regarding attending the G20 summit, which started on Friday, November 23 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Later this week, world leaders, including the Saudi crown prince, are expected to convene at the international summit. The request also aims to investigate bin Salman’s alleged involvement in the torture and murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. “We submitted this info to Argentine prosecutors with the hopes they will investigate MbS’ complicity and responsibility for possible war crimes in Yemen, as well as the torture of civilians, including Jamal Khashoggi,” said HRW’s Middle East and North Africa director Sahara Leah Whiston. She told Al Jazeera that “there’s an extremely strong basis for Argentina to closely examine a very broad record of documentation and facts.” Argentina has not issued any official comment on HRW’s request. The Saudi crown prince is also facing pressure from different countries that Riyadh announced as part of bin Salman’s world tour. In Tunisia, activists protested in the capital on Monday to protest against MbS’ intention to visit the African country. Bin Salman is expected to arrive in Tunisia this afternoon. He also visited Egypt on Monday, where he held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi In their protests, activists presented banners saying that the crown prince is not welcome in their country. The same anti-MbS sentiments were shared by Algerian politicians.  On November 24, the President of Algerian Islamist party Society for Peace (MSP), Abderrazak Makri, said that MbS is seeking to “hide his role”  in Khashoggi’s murder.

By Majid Morceli San Francisco – The Algerians expected that the speech would be more of the same thing, in which the King reviews the accomplishments in Morocco’s southern provinces and how Morocco fought the enemies of its territorial integrity.  To this day, the Algerians have been unable to respond to the King’s offer. The Algerian decision makers—and nobody knows who they might be—are aided by their media, including their “independent” media. The media want the world to believe that Algeria’s call for a meeting of the Maghreb Union foreign ministers is the answer to the King’s offer. The Algerian regime prides itself on being brave and independent of any outside pressure, and they have succeeded in selling this myth to the Algerian masses, unfortunately for them. Hiding behind the Maghreb Union to indirectly respond to Morocco’s offer is not courageous. Morocco should not entertain Algeria’s outdated tactics. The people of the Maghreb are tired of the perpetual fighting when other countries can move on. No one wants Algeria to have another “Black Decade” reminiscent of the 1990s civil war, but Algerians should not keep the memories of the past from holding them back. The Algerians need to start asking themselves what President Bouteflika and his cronies have accomplished in the last 20 years even when their oil was selling for $120 per barrel. The Algerians especially need to ask themselves if the millions spent on Polisario is worth their misery. Several countries lauded the King’s call on Algeria to turn the page and start a new beginning without any pre-conditions. Not a single country, even from the Maghreb, congratulated Algeria on calling for its scam meeting. Maghreb countries are sending a clear message to the Algerians that they no longer want to play its outdated games. Algeria’s excuse is that Morocco wants to make the Western Sahara issue a bilateral one, and Algeria can only cooperate with Morocco within the Maghreb Union. Who is Algeria fooling? Is Polisario worth anything without Algeria? Is Algeria’s cowering behind Libya, Tunisia, and Mauritania the answer? Is this all the Algerian officials can come up with?  It would be a big mistake for Morocco to fall for Algeria’s tactics. The reason is simple: They are ill thought-out tactics born out of confusion from the King’s offer. The Algerian regime will simply have to do better. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

Rabat – The InSight lander touched down on Mars on Monday, November 26, 8:52 p.m. Moroccan time. “The whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,” said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). A few minutes after touchdown, the InSight lander deployed its two 2.13-meter-long solar arrays which recharge the spacecraft batteries. The whole process took about 32 minutes. To reach the red planet, InSight travelled 458 million kilometers at a speed of 19,800 kilometers per hour in space. “Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. .@NASAInSight team members rejoice @NASAJPL after getting confirmation of a successful landing on Mars. #MarsLanding Images: https://t.co/D7himWuuOX pic.twitter.com/rzw7QRnVYq — NASA HQ PHOTO (@nasahqphoto) 26 novembre 2018  InSight’s mission “will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed,” NASA said in a statement on Monday. InSight, according to Bridenstine, “will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars.” The Moroccan head of NASA’s Planetary Studies Department, Kamal Oudrhiri, told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that “landing on Mars is one of the most improbable scientific achievements in terms of global exploration, as the success rate is only 40 percent.” A failure rate of 60 percent “obviously makes things complicated but also exciting if they succeed,” he added. Oudrhiri, who worked on the Mars InSight project, said Sunday that the new scientific mission will study the internal composition of the red planet and that InSight has been equipped with seismometers and a heat flow sensor. Having worked for NASA for more than 20 years, Oudrhiri contributed to several key missions, including missions related to Mars exploration craft: Curiosity, Rovers, Spirit, and Opportunity. Two days after touchdown, the InSight spacecraft will start deploying its 1.8-meter long robotic arm to photograph the landscape. Aaah…soaking up the Sun with my solar panels. 🌞 After a long flight, and thrilling #MarsLanding, it feels great to get a good stretch and recharge my batteries. (Like, literally.) It’s just what I’ll need to really start getting in tune with #Mars. https://t.co/yse3VEst3G pic.twitter.com/LpsiI0KNNz — NASAInSight (@NASAInSight) 27 novembre 2018 Starting this week, the two-year mission will begin collecting data. However, the engineering team will have two to three months to place the lander’s instruments into Mars ground. “Landing was thrilling, but I’m looking forward to the drilling,” said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. “When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments.” Many European partners, including France’s National Center for Space Studies (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) supported the InSight mission.

By Shaquile Goff The Egyptian film industry is the apex of cinema in the Middle East, and at the 40th FIFC festival the best film directors in the Arab world gathered to compete for the coveted “Golden Pyramid” award. Hicham Lasri, a native of Casablanca, submitted his film “Al Jahiliya” at the festival on Sunday. The title of the film translates to “ignorance” and refers to pre-Islamic Arabia. The film tells the story of six characters experiencing a historic 1996 event, according to IMDB. The film stars Aziz Hettab, Nisrine Radi, Mustafa Houari, and Zoubida Akif, among other actors from around Morocco and the Arab world. Hettab and Houari also previously co-starred in the 2010 Moroccan drama “Majid,” a movie screened at several film festivals around Morocco and the Middle East, and lauded by film critics. Lasri previously also screened Al Jahiliya at the 71st Cannes Film Festival in France.  The FIFC was founded in 1976 and is one of only 15 film festivals in the world given an “A” ranking by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations. FIFC is also the oldest and only internationally recognized film festival in the Middle East and Africa, according to the festival’s website.  The festival has taken place every year since 1976, except for 2011 and 2013, due to issues with budgeting and political instability. Lasri has already received several commendations this year for “Al Jahiliya,” notably from feminist organizations who commend his inclusion of gender issues in the Arab world in the movie. Critics say it is a stark departure from his previous filmmaking style.  The director is usually known for making surrealist-style films, however with Al Jahiliya, he revealed that he was not limited to just one genre or filmmaking style.  In addition to Lasri, Moroccan director Mohcine Basri is also scheduled to compete in Cairo with his film “Laaziza.” The festival, held November 20-29, is located in the historic Cairo Opera House.

By Carolina McCabe On Saturday, over 106,000 protesters who are part of “gilets jaunes” or “yellow vests” took to the streets in France. Outcry grew after President Emmanuel Macron introduced a new hydrocarbon tax to promote alternative energy. The tax raised prices 23 percent in a year, to an average of €1.51 per liter of diesel. The last time fuel prices in France reached that level was in the early 2000s, AFP said. However, anger also stems from distrust and disappointment in Macron and the French government. Since the protests began, 2 people have died in traffic related incidents and over 500 people have been injured. Protests became violent and destructive, damaging shops on the Champs-Elysees with smashed windows and graffiti. Clean up operations are now underway, with over 200 workers repairing what officials estimate could be up to €1.5 million in damage. Police responded to protesters on Saturday with water cannons and tear gas. Paris Police Chief Michel Delpuech stated that police forces used 5,000 teargas canisters, and fire services put out about 100 fires. Police arrested 103 people. Officials worry about the perception the protests will have around the world. During a news briefing, Government Spokesman Benjamin Griveaux stated, “We shouldn’t underestimate the impact of these images of the Champs-Élysées … with battle scenes that were broadcast by the media in France and abroad.”  Ministers and public officials have been steadfast in their decisions and said the environment-friendly tax increases will remain in place. Macron is expected to release measures that will make the transition more conscious of its impact on members of the lower and middle-class. The yellow vest protests also symbolize division between urban elites and the rural citizens of France. The movement, which developed over social media, illustrates dissatisfaction with Macron, mirroring his approval rating, which has fallen to 26 percent, according to Politico.  Macron condemned the protests through a tweet, stating, “Shame on those who have abused other citizens and journalists. Shame on those who have tried to intimidate elected officials. No room for this violence in the Republic.”  Merci à nos forces de l’ordre pour leur courage et leur professionnalisme. Honte à ceux qui les ont agressées. Honte à ceux qui ont violenté d’autres citoyens et des journalistes. Honte à ceux qui ont tenté d’intimider des élus. Pas de place pour ces violences dans la République. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 24, 2018  Moroccan transport operators also went on strike this year partially over high fuel prices. The transportation industry was left paralyzed in October after taxi and bus drivers refused to work with the expensive fuel prices, according to Moroccan news outlets. However, global oil prices have fallen recently from $81 per barrel in late September to $65.50 last week.  The truck drivers’ protest started earlier this year over the government’s requirement they take a training course costing MAD 4,000-8,000.

Rabat – The ministry stated in a press release that the Coast Guard’s auxiliary units received a distress call from the four fishermen, saying that they were trapped in a damaged fishing vessel.

Algeria rescued the fishermen four nautical miles northeast of Ghazaouet.
 Ennahar reported that Algerian fishermen from Ghazaouet rescued the four Moroccan fishermen who were stranded for four days after their boat’s engine had fallen into the sea. The Moroccan fishermen left the port of Nador four days before the Algerians rescued them. According to Erem News, Algerian local media gave much importance to the statement of the Ministry of National Defence about the Moroccan fishermen’s rescue. Earlier this month, 12 fishermen reportedly went missing off the shore of Guelmim near Agadir.

Rabat – Although Morocco is a leading country in the 4G mobile broadband with increasing numbers of subscribers having access to the fourth generation network in Africa, Moroccans will keep using the June 2015 technology for several more years. In its 2018 report about the mobile economy in the MENA region, the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) has indicated that Morocco will not get the fifth generation of mobile technology until 2022. GSMA set due dates for the 5G commercial launches in other MENA countries, revealing that Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates will get 5G as soon as 2019. Oman will get the technology in 2020 and then Turkey and Jordan in 2021. Tunisia and Algeria will have to wait until 2023. According to the GSMA report, while Morocco will be relatively late to adopt the 5G technology, other mobile operators, such as the Emirati Etisalat, the Qatari Ooredoo, the Saudi STC, and the Kuwaiti Zain have already launched 5G deployment trials in their home countries before the official commercialization. GSMA covers mobile operators, networks and mobile virtual network operators around the world. It represents the interests of 750 operators and 350 hardware and software companies in addition to internet companies.

Rabat- Here follows the full text of the royal message, which was read by HRH Prince Moulay Rachid at the royal Academy of the kingdom of Morocco: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to send you a message at the opening of this Symposium, which is being held under my patronage and which has been convened by the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in collaboration with the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco. This Symposium has been organized to mark the centenary of the birth of His late Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding President of our sister nation, the United Arab Emirates. I should like to say how much I appreciate this initiative to commemorate this great Arab leader. Through his wisdom and clear-sightedness, Sheikh Zayed contributed to consolidating not only Moroccan-Emirati brotherly bonds, but also unity and solidarity between Arab countries. The two sister nations – the Kingdom of Morocco and the United Arab Emirates – have every reason to celebrate this event. Indeed, the relations between the two nations are steeped in history. The foundations of this longstanding relationship were laid by my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II – may he rest in peace – and His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan – may God bless his soul. My venerable father once said that whenever he wanted to describe relations between the Moroccan people and the people of the UAE, he could not find in the dictionary a more fitting description than that of brotherly, most cordial relations. He went on to say that the two peoples were like twins, separated only by geography. Morocco, its King and people have the highest regard for this illustrious leader and his esteemed royal family, whose members have remained ever faithful to the brotherly bonds of loyalty uniting them to my family as well as to the Kingdom of Morocco. Ladies and Gentlemen, Guided by a firm belief in a common destiny and the need for solidarity between Arab countries, the leaders of the two nations worked with dedication and goodwill to provide the conditions for the promotion of bilateral and joint Arab action in order to rise to the challenges facing our peoples. His Highness Sheikh Zayed – may he rest in peace – built the United Arab Emirates. Thanks to the development and prosperity which ensued, he turned the concept of unity from a mere dream into reality. He also took an active part in the creation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). At the same time, my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II – may God bless his soul – was seeking to build the Maghreb Union because it was a strategic choice and a popular demand. The aim was to achieve comprehensive development, integration and complementarity. This attests to the wisdom and foresight which characterized the two leaders, who also shared a firm belief in unity, legitimacy, dialogue and commitment to upholding just Arab and Islamic causes.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Continuing our joint action today to promote these exemplary relations is the best way to show loyalty to the special relationship that existed between Sheikh Zayed and Hassan II – may God bless their souls. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate to my esteemed brother, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and to my dear brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, my strong desire to remain committed to the same course of action, for the mutual benefit of our two peoples. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Moroccans planted 3.5 million hectares of wheat on 4.5 million hectares of land. Morocco planted 2.5 million hectares of seedlings on 5 million hectares of land, the Ministry of Agriculture said. In the Gharb region, however, the heavy rainfall has delayed planting because access to the region’s land is difficult. The agriculture ministry’s measures this season included providing the market with 680,000 tons of fertilizers and 2.2 million quintals of selected seeds, 700,000 of which were sold by November 16. The selected seeds are genetically improved and certified. The ministry explained that it supplied enough seeds in the market to meet the demand, because farmers habitually keep part of their crop from the last season to use as seeds. Moroccans planted legumes on 130,000 hectares out of 260,000 hectares of land. The ministry added that the citrus harvest will be delayed by 10 days due to the cold wave that swept Morocco. The delay partly explains why Morocco only exported 35,000 tons of citrus in the 12 months up to November 16, down from 100,000 tons in the previous 12 months. Morocco received, on average, 140 millimeters of rain from the beginning of the rainy season in late September to November 16. Last year, in the same period, Morocco received only 67 millimeters of rain. The average rainfall in some regions tripled, as in the case of Fez-Meknes, which recorded 300 millimeters of rain. The southern provinces also benefited from the recent rain, recording more than 50 millimeters. The quality of grazing pastures in the southern range areas has improved, reducing the need to migrate livestock to the north. The rain has also partially refilled dams used for irrigation to the tune of 8 billion cubic meters. By November 16, dams were on average 60 percent full, 4 billion cubic meters more than a year earlier. By the same date, the Moulouya dam in northeastern Morocco reached a fill rate of 85 percent over 14 percent a year earlier. The Loukkos dam in northern Morocco was 80 percent full by mid-November, and El Haouz was 75 percent full. The Doukkala dam in west-central Morocco recorded a poorer showing, only 40 percent full.

Rabat – In a statement published by Sabca yesterday, the company said that the two companies hope to create a “major and independent regional player in Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul and upgrade (MRO&amp;U) for military aircraft.” The agreement came during the state visit of Princess Astrid of Belgium, who is leading a large delegation to explore investment opportunities in Morocco. After the working visit, Belgian companies will sign agreements with Morocco in several fields. Sabca CEO Thibault Jongen said that Morocco “quickly became a natural choice to install this new base.” Sabca also has a subsidiary in Morocco. Jongen said the company’s experience “gained through the development of our subsidiary Sabca Maroc is very positive.” He added that the workforce “is highly skilled, the government encourages the industrial development and both our countries want to strengthen their cooperation.” Since 2012, the company has produced assemblies for Airbus and Dassault Aviation planes. Explaining the company’s mission in aircraft maintenance, the statement said that it “has strong ties with Morocco,” recalling cooperation with the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF). “We are therefore looking forward to writing a new chapter to our cooperation with Morocco together with Sabena Aerospace.” The two companies are also satisfied with the partnership they signed. According to the CEO of Sabena Aerospace, Stephane Burton, the company has had “strong ties” with Moroccan aviation experts, including Morocco’s carrier Royal Air Maroc, for several decades. The statement added that “like the partnership between the Belgium Defense and the Belgian industry, this combined offer from two major players in military maintenance will allow the RMAF to develop a long term strategic partnership with a Moroccan industrial player.” The partnership will also “optimize operational availability of their fleet and strengthen the Moroccan aeronautic expertise.” In the past decade, Morocco has become a growing hub in the field of aeronautics. The sector is expected to continue to grow 20 percent annually in the next five years. Morocco also attracted several aeronautics companies, including Boeing, which has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses, for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. Montreal-based Bombardier, the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, also built a manufacturing facility in Morocco in 2014.

Rabat – A government source close to the dossier told Morocco World News that it was not MBS who snubbed Morocco, but the other way around. News circulated last week of MBS snubbing Morocco as a destination in his ongoing world tour. MBS, the argument went, was punishing Rabat for diverting from Saudi strategic guidelines, especially in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and in the Saudis’ feud with Qatar. Earlier this week, however, the Espace MRE outlet said Morocco snubbed the Saudi prince instead. According to the MWN source, Morocco decided that it was not ready to host MBS at such a critical juncture. Although the original article is no longer accessible—probably taken down for some obscure reasons—Morocco World News contacted a source who has been briefed on the information. Requesting anonymity, the source emphatically confirmed that Morocco did in fact raise concerns about hosting MBS. However, in his usual diplomatic tone, the King did not decline MBS’s request outright, the source said. Instead, King Mohammed VI reportedly brought up his “busy schedule” at the time MBS requested for the visit and an audience with Mohammed VI, suggesting that a meeting between the two was not going to happen. The visit to Morocco was therefore “not appropriate.” But still, the Moroccan monarch reportedly proposed that MBS meet Moulay Rachid, the King’s diplomat brother, provided that the Saudi prince wanted to proceed with the visit despite the concerns Morocco had raised. MBS rejected King Mohammed VI’s alternative. Weeks after the reported exchange, Saudi Arabia made public the news of MBS’s “world tour,” including Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, and Algeria. Morocco was the great absentee on the princely list, leading to speculations that Saudi Arabia was taking punitive steps towards Morocco’s numerous positions that do not align with Riyadh’s strategic interests. MBS, persona non grata? Morocco has remained a strong Saudi ally over the years. Despite recent incidents that led the two kingdoms to give each other the cold shoulder on a number of shared interests, reports that MBS snubbed Morocco carried weight in Arab politics. Rabat has a reputation as a strong Saudi ally in North Africa, and yet it was the only country in the Maghreb that did not feature on MBS’ list of visits. In Rabat’s eyes, however, MWN’s source confirmed, international reputation matters. The source did not elaborate further. But the unfolding of events in countries planning to receive MBS helped make the point: The Khashoggi murder carries significance in how many perceive MBS. As the world has concentrated on Khashoggi’s murder, MBS’s reputation is fatally tarnished. The once all-powerful and charismatic young Saudi prince has become persona non grata for many in the international community. When Algeria and Tunisia confirmed that MBS was expected there, a wave of protests erupted to challenge the governments for hosting the Saudi prince. Taking to the streets, Tunisian activists said MBS was “not welcome” in their country. “It is a shame that Tunisia, which has witnessed a democratic transition and a revolution against tyranny and dictatorship, will receive a criminal whose hands were stained with the blood of Saudis and Yemenis,” one of the activists said.

Rabat – In the lead up to next week’s talks, the four parties are mobilizing their delegations to take part in the meeting, an initial step toward an agreed upon solution to the conflict. The pan-African magazine Jeune Afrique reported that Morocco’s delegation will include the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region President Khattat Yanja and and the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region President Hamdi Ould Errachid. The UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, invited Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario and Mauritania to a UN roundtable of talks in Geneva.  The UN wants the meeting to serve as an initial step toward a more robust move in preparation to re-launch negotiations to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. Algeria, which claims itself an observer to the conflict, will be represented by Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel, his adviser Abdallah Baali, and Algeria’s ambassador to the UN Sabri Boukadoum. While Algeria denies its responsibility in the conflict, UN Resolution 2440 called on it as well as the other parties to “work constructively with the  Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” Analysts say the resolution represented a diplomatic gain for Morocco because it included Algeria, calling it a neighboring country to the conflict. Algeria still calls itself an observer despite the UN’s clear message in Resolution 2440, adopted on October 31. Mauritania’s delegation, which will take part in the Geneva roundtable of talks, will include Minister of Foreign Affairs Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. The separatist group will be represented by the self-proclaimed president of Parliament Khatri Addouh, and M’Hammad Khaddad, former chief of military security. The meeting, the first of its kind since 2012, will oversee the determination of the parties to engage in future negotiations. In October, Bourita said that Morocco would  attend the roundtable to remind the participants of Morocco’s firm conditions. Morocco is firm that it will accept no solution other than its autonomy plan. The Moroccan official also said that Algeria needs to contribute to finding a solution to the conflict, saying it is the “one which created the problem.” King Mohammed VI called for more dialogue between Morocco and Algeria to break tension and the stalemate resulting from frozen diplomatic ties. The King’s offer was echoed by Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting between Bourita and Algeria’s ambassador to Rabat on Monday In the meeting, Bourita told the Algerian diplomat that Morocco wants to know the official response of Algeria regarding Morocco’s dialogue offer.

Rabat- Following in the steps of Fatima al-Fihriya, who founded the world’s oldest still-operating university in 859 A.D., Fatima al-Madrassi volunteered to found the ENCG in 2003. ENCG is a subsidiary of Mohamed Premier University in Oujda. In a Facebook post on November 20, the secretary of state for higher education and scientific research, Khalid Samadi, wrote that he was surprised to find out about ENCG’s female founder and the funds on which she established the school while on a visit there.   Samadi did not state how much she had to start Oujda’s ENCG, but he noted the similarities between the two “Fatimas of Morocco” and the significance of Madrassi’s role as a philanthropist. Madrassi is a shy woman who does not like the spotlight, Samadi said and expressed a desire to meet her.   Samadi said that Madrassi considers all the ENCG students as her own children. Like Fatima al-Fihriya, the daughter of a wealthy merchant whose family came from Kairouan in Tunisia, Fatima al-Madrassi is a 21st-century founder of a scholarly institution. The 1,159-year-old University of Al Quaraouiyine, which takes its name from Kairouan, is world’s oldest existing and still-operating higher educational institution, according to UNESCO and Guinness World Records.  Al Quaraouiyine has one of the world’s oldest libraries with over 30,000 books and manuscripts, including a 9th-century Qur’an and one of the earliest collections of hadiths, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad with accounts of his daily practice. Al Quaraouiyine Library also made it onto Time’s first annual list of the world’s greatest places in August 2018.

Rabat – “Morocco strongly urges all countries and organizations concerned with the oceans’ sustainability issue to join [Blue Belt] initiative which aims to protect 10% of the world’s coastal and marine areas, restore degraded habitats and seabeds, and foster the emergence of greener fishing fleets,” Akhannouch said Monday at the Sustainable Blue Economy conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Morocco launched the Blue Belt initiative at the COP22 summit in November 2016 in Marrakech. Akhannouch explained that the initiative is a collaborative platform for state and non-state actors to design, finance, and implement new sustainable economic activities related to the “blue economy,” a reference to marine life, Maghreb Arab Press reported. It is also a platform for solutions to adapt the fisheries and aquaculture sectors to climate change. “What brings us together today is a shared commitment to moving towards a sustainable blue economy,” Akhannouch stressed. The minister recalled King Mohammed VI’s speech at the “Africa Action Summit” at COP22. The King proposed to build “an African continent that is resilient to climate change and that commits resolutely to sustainable development.” “An African continent that will use its resources in an optimal way, while respecting environmental and social balances; a continent that will seek to promote inclusive development, in line with the specific features of its identity, particularly the culture of sharing, of fairness and of solidarity,” the monarch said. The fisheries sector provides a livelihood for about 3 million people in Morocco, Akhannouch noted. Sustainable development of the ocean economy has been among Morocco’s main concerns since the launch of the Halieutis strategy in 2009, he added. Morocco, through an Akhannouch-led delegation, is participating in the Sustainable Blue Economy conference, held November 26-28 in Nairobi.  Themed “The blue economy and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” the conference is the first global conference on the blue economy in Africa.  Over 6,000 participants from around the world were expected to take part in the conference to share ideas on how to transition to a blue economy. Participants will discuss a measure that “harnesses the potential of our oceans, seas, lakes and rivers to improve the lives of all, particularly developing states and women and girls.” They will also discuss innovations and “best practices to build prosperity while conserving our waters for future generations.”

Rabat – The event is focusing on how to improve interregional and international trade between African countries through the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement by reducing cost, time, and complexity. Trade facilitation measures, if correctly implemented, will not only boost trade but also improve revenue collection, and make trade easier, faster, and cheaper. UNCTAD believes that full implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement could reduce trade costs by up to 15 percent. “A central cog of the Trade Facilitation Agreement is the obligation of each country to set up a National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) with public and private sector stakeholders to facilitate both domestic coordination and implementation of the provisions of this agreement,” the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) wrote. More than 300 participants from the public and private sector, business community, donors, and regional and international organizations are attending the forum. UNCTAD organized the event along with the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the World Customs Organization, the International Trade Center, and the UN economic commissions for Africa and Europe.

Rabat – David Hale made the remarks yesterday in a meeting with Habib El Malki, speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives. Hale extensively commented on the US position on the ongoing UN-led initiative to broker a lasting and mutually acceptable political settlement in the four decade-long diplomatic stalemate in Western Sahara. The general sentiment in Washington, according to the American diplomat, is that a possible rapprochement between Rabat and Algiers could lead to important overtures both in terms of regional security and in reaching a permanent solution in the territorial dispute in Western Sahara. Dialogue is the only way forward as both countries face similar security and social challenges, Hale noted. He saluted Morocco’s dialogue offer to Algeria, pointing out that sustainable settlement will only be possible when stakeholders are ready to sit at the negotiating table and compromise on old grievances. For his part, El Malki put forward the Morocco-US relations, underlining that Rabat has been a robust American ally on terrorism and other security matters. He said Morocco has steadily partnered in America’s fight against terror and transnational criminal networks, establishing itself as the unfailing regional bastion of security and political stability. “Morocco is a security and stability haven in a troubled region,” the Moroccan parliamentarian said. Of Morocco’s Sahara position, El Malki reiterated King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer, hinting at the kingdom’s readiness to “support the UN-led initiative” and engage “in frank dialogue” with Algiers and other concerned parties. A premonition of failure in Geneva? Hale and El Malki’s meeting comes just a week before the unprecedented UN-led roundtable scheduled December 5-6 in Geneva. Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front have said they will attend the Geneva meeting. On the 43rd anniversary of the Green March earlier this month, King Mohammed VI made the unprecedented move of offering “a frank dialogue” opportunity to discuss the sour Rabat-Algiers relations. The Moroccan monarch said that it was time for both countries to put aside decades-long grievances towards each other to allow for a paradigm shift in bilateral ties and proxy confrontation in the Sahara conflict. Morocco’s offer has since received a series of supportive statements from foreign diplomats, world leaders, and international organizations. For all the international fervor, however, Algiers has remained characteristically silent, resurging old doubts about the prospects of the upcoming UN-led discussion. As Morocco’s extended hand remains ignored by Algeria, it remains to be seen whether the much-anticipated Geneva meeting can prove critical to the international community’s hoped-for diplomatic overtures.

Rabat – Mauritania’s foreign affairs ministry announced its “commitment” to the AMU in a statement quoted by the Mauritanian Information Agency (AMI). The statement added that Mauritania would like to “host” the extraordinary meeting of the AMU’s foreign ministers “as soon as possible.” The country also said that it is open to all “initiatives that contribute to the revitalization of the institutions of the Arab Maghreb” to meet the expectations of its people. On November 6, King Mohammed VI acknowledged the division and lack of unity in the Maghreb due to political tensions in the region in a speech to the nation. The monarch called for more cooperation between Morocco and Algeria, describing their bilateral ties as not normal and much less than acceptable. Through his speech, King Mohammed VI reiterated Morocco’s commitment to developing the Maghreb, calling for any initiative to break the stalemate between Morocco and Algeria. In response, Algeria requested a meeting of the AMU’s foreign affairs ministers to happen soon. Like the Moroccan dialogue offer, the Algerian meeting initiative received a nod from the African Union. The chairman of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, encouraged all the AU members to work towards the proposed meeting to revive Maghreb construction. He added, in a statement published on November 23, that the regional economic communities are the pillars of the African Union. Moroccan officials have extended their hands several times to Algeria to open the border, which has been closed for many years. Algeria closed the border between the two countries in 1994 when Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian visitors in the wake of a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni hotel in Marrakech. In 2004, Morocco lifted the visa requirement, but the border has remained closed. However, the closed border is not the issue that has hampered cooperation between the two countries. Both countries have been issuing requests to each other. While Morocco urges its eastern neighbor to take responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict because Algeria hosts and arms the Polisario Front, Algeria calls on Morocco to remain neutral in the conflict and leave it to be taken care of only at the United Nations. Morocco supports the United Nations’ political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to the conflict. However, Morocco finds Algeria’s request objectionable because Morocco is defending its position and territorial integrity. An authorized Algerian diplomat speaking anonymously said that Algeria has more conditions to break the stalemate between the two countries. Two of its other conditions are to stop propaganda war and end the flow of drugs into Algeria. While Algeria has called for the end of propaganda, some Algerian news outlets and politicians are still accusing Morocco of sending drugs into Algeria. The most recent remark came from the president of the Rally of Algerian Hope (TAJ) party, Amar Ghoul, who claimed that Morocco is sending “hashish and drugs” to Algeria. He also accused Morocco of exploiting Algerian-based oil, sugar, and consumer products subsidized to billions of dollars. Created in 1989 after the signing of a treaty, the AMU aims to ensure a regional hub to enhance economic activities with free circulation of people and goods. The union wants to create integration among the member countries like that of the European Union and the African Union. However, regional conflicts have hampered the union and created division, as King Mohammed VI emphasized in his speech.

Rabat – Last week, Polisario’s proclaimed minister of national defense, Abdellah Lahbib, made a tour of Tifariti and Mehriz, towns east of Morocco’s berm wall in Western Sahara, according to Polisario’s “official news agency” SPS. The visit may escalate tension in the conflict, coming two weeks ahead of a UN roundtable scheduled for December 5-6 at the request of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General, Horst Kohler. The pro-Polisario news platform said Lahbib’s visit to what it calls the “liberated zones” marked the “inauguration of several facilities and inaugurating numerous facilities and laying the foundation for construction of others.” The Sahrawi “People’s Liberation Army,” the outlet said, “achieves security and stability thanks to its readiness, professionalism and thwarting of all schemes of the Moroccan enemy aimed at flooding the region with drugs.” The Polisario Front is violating UN Security Council Resolution 2440, which called on the front to “fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat.” The areas refer to towns in Western Sahara east of Morocco’s defense wall. The Security Council adopted the resolution on October 31. The resolution also warned the front to withdraw from any intention that might change the status quo of the region or hamper the UN-led political process. The UN also banned any meeting between foreign representatives outside of the Tindouf camps in Algeria, and urged Polisario to refrain from relocating or constructing any facilities in the areas that Polisario has long claimed as “liberated zones.” The separatist group also defied the UN’s orders when it carried out similar actions in the region this year. Polisario organized a military parade in Tifariti in May, defying the previous resolution, 2414, adopted on April 28. The UN Security Council expressed serious concerns then about Polisario’s intention to relocate its administrative functions to Bir Lahlou.

It’s his first goal this season in the league. Following this score, Schalke took 14th place with 13 points. On Saturday, Schalke 04 defeated Nuremberg in the 12th round of the Bundesliga (5-2). The 21-year-old Moroccan, an attacking midfielder, registered his name on the scoresheet as the Royal Blues secured their fourth league victory of the season. Schalke thrashed ten men from Nurnberg on Saturday afternoon with Steven Skrzybski getting a brace for the hosts. Skrzybski netted a brace while Amine Harit, Guido Burgstaller and Bastian Oczipka were on target for Schalke. Federico Palacios and Adam Zrelak scored for Nurnberg. Winner of the Bundesliga Rookie of the Year award for the 2017–18, Harit joined Schalke 04 in July 2017.

Rabat- Drug trafficking continues to be an issue in Morocco, especially the movement of psychoactive drugs and cannabis, or hash, which are popular in the illegal drug market. The National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) sized 2,310 psychotropic tablets and 2,190 tablets of psychoactive drug known as ecstasy, as well as three mobile phones in the possession of the husband and wife. Drug traffickers typically use more than one mobile phone to carry out drug dealing operations. The police intercepted the suspects as they were driving in their car in Fez. The couple is currently under investigation, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). In the same month, the judicial police arrested a suspect for trafficking 20,000 ecstasy tablets and 1,980 Rivotril tablets, a seizure medication in Mohammedia, near Casablanca. Customs officials in Morocco also report drug traffickers attempting to smuggle drugs to Europe, largely through Tangier Med Port. In September, custom officers at the port seized 28 kilograms of cannabis resin from an international transport truck.  The trafficker concealed the cannabis in the walls of his vehicle. Cannabis resin is one of the most exported drugs from Morocco and has continuously been seized in recent years.  Morocco’s report on the implementation of criminal policy announced in July that authorities recorded 85,000 cases of drug-related crimes in 2017. Drug cases resulted in the arrest of 74,573 suspects in 2012, while 88,179 suspects of drug-related crimes were arrested in 2016.

By Zakaria Wadghiri Rabat – Police had told the National that the woman living in Al-Ain, near Oman, had prepared his remains in machboos (a traditional Emirati dish of rice and meat) and then served the dish to Pakistani workers living near her home. Another police official indicated that the ongoing investigation has proved many details of the story “wrong,” specifically referring to cooking the victim’s remains.According to her lawyer, the 37-year-old met her lover, a 29-year-old single man, who also worked as a tailor, in a clothing store seven years ago. He lived near her home in Oud Tawba.

On the day of the incident, the woman’s lawyer said she was with her boyfriend and friends late at night. At around 3 a.m. on November 3, he took her home, according to the testimony of witnesses who saw them leaving together. 

The same day, he called her in the afternoon and asked to have lunch with her. She welcomed him, and when he arrived, he asked her to accompany him on a trip to a mountain called Jebel Hafeet. 

The woman declined the invitation, according to her lawyer, because she was moving to another apartment, and asked him for assistance in moving her furniture.

They argued over the subject, and the man allegedly slapped her face violently. He grabbed her hair and pulled her down until her head was level with the table. She saw a knife hanging over her, and she grabbed it and stabbed him in the chest, according to Khaleej News.

When the woman saw blood, she had a panic attack. She then cut his body into three pieces and cooked it, Khaleej News reported. After a few days, the man’s friends filed a form for a missing person. The woman’s lawyer, Khalid bin Jumhoor Al Ahbabi, described his client as a 37-year-old married woman with children living with their father in Morocco, as reported by Emarat Al Youm. She has been living in the UAE for 10 years.

Rabat – The credential presentation ceremony took place during a meeting chaired by the Saudi monarch; several new African, Arab, Asian and European ambassadors officially took office as their countries’ representatives in Saudi Arabia. The Moroccan ambassador told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that this meeting was an opportunity to convey the greetings of King Mohammed VI to King Salman.

The diplomat also communicated his determination to work for the strengthening of relations between the two countries in accordance with the royal vision to consolidate the links of Morocco with sister countries. King Salman also expressed regard for King Mohammed VI, promising Riyadh’s determination to facilitate Mansouri’s mission.

”The meeting was held in a fraternal atmosphere that reflects the nature of the relationship between the two brother countries,” said Mansouri. On November 18, the newly appointed Saudi ambassador to Morocco,  Abdullah Al-Ghariri, was also sworn before King Salman in Riyadh to take his office in Morocco. Al-Ghariri replaces Abdelaziz Mohieddine, who took office in 2016. Despite promises to further consolidate diplomatic ties, Moroccan-Saudi relations have been tense since Morocco’s decision to stay neutral on the Gulf crisis between the Saudi-led coalition and Qatar. International analysts also questioned whether the decision of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to not include Morocco in his world tour was due to the cold diplomatic ties between the two countries.

Rabat- It was a sobering night in Casablanca, one of those moments when a game of football can bring together people of different walks of life, making social class irrelevant as the crowd shouts like one to elicit a winning display from their boys.   Since 2003, the year it claimed its last African cup and when the name Raja was associated with class and mastery in African football, continental victory has eluded the green boys of Casablanca. Despite being good at times and maintaining a steady reputation as one of the top two Moroccan football teams, Raja has been dealt continuous blows, ranging from internal crises to poor output in continental tournaments that mattered. But Sunday was different. It had to be.  Receiving DR Congo’s Vita Club, Coach Garrido’s boys knew that having the match in Casablanca was an opportunity to deny the slightest upper hand to a Congolese team known for being deadly on home ground.  Rajaoui’s boys’ mission on Sunday, their coach later revealed to the press as he indulged in his team’s victory, was to claim the three points needed to have some breathable atmosphere before Sunday’s return leg in Kinshasa. In football, as in life, there are moments when victory is not just about putting in the required performance to claim the points you need to get ahead, or win, in the tournament or competition.  There are defining moments when winning is all that matters, regardless of the rewards that that might bring. Or perhaps the reward is implicit in the very act of winning. It might be for pride. Or the fear of disappointing those who have faith in you, and stood by you even in the most ominous of occasions. Or the urge to rewrite history, or be part of it. Or the urgency to do what is necessary to end a chewing crisis.  It is difficult to pin down which of these points really counted in Raja’s riotous victory against their Congolese counterparts. Let’s just say it was a combination of all those factors, each playing a sizable part in the ultimate composition of the story. But there was, too,  something else at play on Sunday: the disarming determination of Raja’s fans. In the most incipient moments of the game, when victory seemed impossible, distant,  it was the football-crazy 50,000 green and red onlookers that crafted the narrative of hope the players lacked–and needed. Soufiane Rahimi, the 22-year-old whose brace proved crucial in opening the floodgates that ultimately sunk the traditionally compact Vita defense, spoke of family and pride and identity. For the young forward, games like  Sunday’s go beyond the realm of football.  In matches like that, he opined, you think of your family and everyone else who made it possible for you to be where you are. You don’t play just because it is your own passion or your profession. Deep down, you play for the joy and happiness of the thousands who left their activities to come motivate you. And when you do win, he explained, his face still beaming with the afterglow of an exceptional night, the feeling is a mixture of emotion and affiliation. “I am over the moon…. We stayed focused and I’m really happy to have been part of all this, to have helped my teammates land the victory.” But the young Moroccan was aware that the second leg might—will surely—bring a tougher challenge against an opponent used to home victory. His thrill for playing a key role  in his team’s dominant display should not be reason for complacency, he elaborated. When Raja travels to DR Congo this weekend to take on Vita on Sunday, the goal will be to pressure their opponents as relentlessly as possible. Like on Sunday. Rahimi’s caution was well placed, considering that the game on Sunday was a deadlock until minute 46. For 45 minutes during the first half, the Congolese were defensively impeccable, foiling Raja’s endless attempts to find a crack in their tactical disposition.  At which point, as the Congolese gave no impression of surrendering to Raja’s ferocious attacking vitality, the public, the twelfth man, chimed in.  Riotous, shouting chants that brought vigor and accuracy and courage and rigor to a game that seemed to be marching toward a lifeless draw, the crowd rekindled the players’ spirit. Raja’s boys, cheered up by a demanding public of nearly 50,000 football-mad, picked up accuracy and organization in the second half.  From then on, as Raja now played to meet the demands of a fan base that has stood by them through trials and errors, loyal to the point of unreasonable fanaticism—the pleonasm is warranted in this case—things started to go from bad to worse for the Congolese.  Down 1-0 at the 47th minute, 2-0 at the 61th minute, Vita players felt visibly powerless before the strength that a supportive crowd can prove. The third goal was merely a matter of time now. Vita looked besieged, beleaguered, and recognizably desperate. Few teams can resist the disarming energy of a fan base as besotted as Raja’s. And when that third goal came, at the 66th minute, time seemed to have stopped at the Mohammed V stadium. Nothing else existed. Nothing else could be heard. Nothing else mattered, except for the phenomenal return to continental glory. The stadium, covered in green and red, erupted in excited chants as an enamored rajaoui public celebrated the kind of victory that had eluded them for 15 years.  Mohamed Oulhaj, the former Raja captain who is now in his tenth season with the Casablanca-based team, said that Raja’s Sunday’s victory should resonate with all Moroccans. Raja, Oulhaj explained, played for the pride of Moroccan football.  After all the fuss that accompanied Morocco’s victory at the 2018 CHAN and Wydad’s triumph at the 2017-2018 African Champions League, it is hard to argue against Oulhaj’s point.

Rabat – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation issued a statement to make public the points discussed during the meeting between the Moroccan official and the Algerian diplomat. The ministry said that Bourita reiterated Morocco’s desire to have an official reaction of the Algerian authorities to the King’s offer to establish a political mechanism for dialogue and consultation with Algeria. The ministry added that Morocco remains “open and optimistic” about the future of relations with Algeria and that the recent Algerian request for a meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) foreign ministers is “unrelated to the royal initiative.” The statement asserted Morocco’s offer is “purely bilateral, while the Algerian approach is part of the revival  of regional construction.” The Moroccan ministry also recalled that King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer, announced on November 6, has been “hailed by a large number of countries and regional and international organizations.” Besides the indirect statement from Algeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the AMU’s foreign ministers meeting, Algeria has not issued any official announcement in response to the King’s offer. Several sources from Algeria spoke anonymously about the Moroccan offer to the press. One anonymous source said that King Mohammed VI’s offer is “questionable” and “not sincere.” In response to the Algerian claims, Morocco’s ministry said that the royal initiative “stems from a sincere desire to create a framework for direct and inclusive bilateral dialogue to resolve all disputes between the two countries,” and to relaunch their cooperation and consult on regional challenges. Commenting on the AMU meeting, Morocco said that it took note of the letters of the secretary-general of the AMU, which informed Morocco of the Tunisian and Algerian requests for the meeting of foreign ministers. According to Morocco, the state of “lethargy that the AMU has known for years, is mainly due to the abnormal nature of Moroccan-Algerian relations, which can be treated only in the framework of a bilateral dialogue, direct and without intermediaries.” The statement echoes King Mohammed VI’s request to revive bonds between the two countries, describing the ties between Morocco and Algeria as “not normal” and “much less than acceptable.” The countries’ border has been closed since 1994. The King also condemned the division and lack of unity within the Maghreb due to regional conflicts. The statement concluded that Morocco has “no objection” to holding a meeting of the AMU.  However, Morocco’s government is looking forward to receiving an official reaction from Algeria, while remaining committed to a revival of Maghreb construction “on sound and solid foundations.”

Rabat- In Morocco, whole unplucked chickens usually cost no more than MAD 16 per kilo in souks or from chicken vendors. Sometimes prices will drop to MAD 11 or MAD 10 per kilogram.  Cleaned whole chickens usually cost MAD 28 to MAD 30 per kilogram in both souks and supermarkets. Lately, chicken prices at regular souks and chicken vendors reached MAD 25 per kilogram, prompting Moroccans to launch the “Let_it_cluck” hashtag to express discontent with the new prices which many considered “over the top.” Moroccans have been wondering why chicken prices have risen. According to a communique by Morocco’s Interprofessional Poultry Federation (FISA), the truck drivers’ strike that started across the country in October crippled transportation, affecting the poultry sector.  Many trucks transporting poultry to souks throughout Morocco were unable to operate because of strikers stopping the trucks and threatening to use violence if necessary. Often, the poultry transports were forced to return to villages and poultry farms without transporting the goods. FISA had already foreseen and warned of “a significant rise in prices” in October following the transportation problems. The strike also led to an increase in vegetables, fruits, and fish prices. The truck drivers led strikes against the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water’s decision to require drivers take training costing MAD 4,000- 8,000, which they considered too expensive. Following the major boycott against high prices which sprouted online on April 20 targeting three leading companies in Morocco—Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Danone (dairy products), and Afriquia (gasoline)—Moroccans entered a new era of activism. The boycott caused major economic losses for the targeted companies in its early days.  Other less resonant calls for boycott came in summer against the high prices of fish.

Rabat – Mitsubishi’s board made the decision at a meeting on Monday, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko will temporarily take over as the Japanese carmaker’s chairman. Masuko said, “Our proposal was a very difficult one. But we had to make a decision with a priority of what to do to protect the company, our workers and their families.” The motion asserts “Ghosn’s arrest in Japan makes it impossible for him to carry out his duties.” It also says his alleged misconduct raises legal compliance issues, according to NHK. Ghosn, who led the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, is considered a highly influential executive within the global automotive industry. On November 20, Masuko said the alliance would be hard to manage without Ghosn. “I don’t think there is anyone else on Earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,” Masuko told the press in Tokyo. On November 21, Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said, “It’s important that Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi maintain a stable relationship,” the Japanese Kyodo outlet reported. Mitsubishi asked Ghosn to serve as chairman in 2016 when the company was implicated in a scandal over falsified fuel-efficiency data. Renault, where Ghosn is CEO, made a different decision from Mitsubishi and Nissan.  One day after Ghosn’s arrest, the French carmaker’s board of directors decided to keep the 64-year-old Ghosn as the company’s chairman and CEO.  Renault instead named COO Thierry Bollore as temporary deputy CEO and granted him the same powers as Ghosn. Japan arrested both Ghosn and his aide, former Nissan representative director Greg Kelly, last Monday on suspicion of underreporting Ghosn’s compensation by tens of millions of dollars over an 8-year period. Nissan also suspects Ghosn of using company funds for personal expenses as well as other financial misconduct. Sources said Nissan decided to pay Ghosn around $17 million a year, but that only half of the sum was reported in the securities report. Ghosn is suspected of giving instructions to Kelly to report that his annual income was about $9 million, according to NHK sources. Speaking to Tokyo prosecutors during questioning, Ghosn denied underreporting his remuneration in Nissan’s securities reports, sources told the Japanese public broadcaster NHK on Sunday. Ghosn told prosecutors he “had no intention” of falsifying the financial statements. Ghosn reportedly argued that Nissan was responsible for salary reports. He said the Japanese carmaker “made decisions on how much pay would be declared in securities reports.”

Rabat – The inaugurative festival faced several organizational and financial stumbling blocks in the beginning. However, the festival will finally see the light thanks to a partnership between the Imtidad Association for Culture and Development and the city council of Casablanca supported by the Ministry of Culture and Communication and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. The first Casablanca Arab Film Festival will award a best picture prize at the closing ceremony.  Eight films have been nominated for the award: “Diamond Dust” by Marwan Hamed, “The Journey” by Mohamed al-Daraji, “The Guest Aleppo to Istanbul” by Andac Haznedaroglu, “Volubilis” by Faouzi Bensaidi, “Dear Son” by Mohamed Ben Attia, “Until the End of Time” by Yasmine Chouikh, “Writing On Snow” by Rashid Masharawi, and “Camera” by Abdullah Al Junaibi. The festival will showcase a collection of Arab and Moroccan movies, beyond those in the running for the award: “Karma” by Khaled Youssef, “Solitaire” by Sophie Boutros, “Only Men Go to the Grave” by Abdulla Alkaabi, “Barakah Meets Barakah” by Mahmoud Sabbagh, “El Jaida” by Selma Baccar, “Theeb” by Naji Abu Nowar, “3000 Nights” by Mai Masri, “Sotto Voce” by Kamal Kamal, “Khnifist R’mad” by Sanaa Akroud, “The Orchestra of Blinds” by Mohamed Mouftakir, “In Wonderland” by Jihan El Bahhar, and “Yesterday’s Friends” by Hassan Benjelloun. The festival is a wish come true for film critics and Arab film buffs who have wanted an Arab film festival in Morocco.  Casablanca, where many Moroccan movies are produced, is notable for its well-equipped film studios, developed film infrastructure, and low production costs. “The festival is the first of its kind in Morocco. We have dozens of film festivals in the country, but none of them focuses entirely on Arab Film. Also, it is the first big cinema event to be held in Casablanca,” said the director of the Casablanca Arab Film Festival, broadcaster Fatima Al-Nawali, The festival will host workshops, roundtables, and a symposium centered on the current issues facing Arab cinema and the future of cooperation across all components of the film industry.  The festival will also organize training workshops for young movie makers by giving them opportunities to meet professional filmmakers to develop their potential and knowledge in the field.  The Casablanca Arab Film Festival’s official poster features an image from the Egyptian film “Our Beautiful Days.” The image shows the main characters of the film walking together with Casablanca landmarks in the background, indicating that Arab cinema is synonymous with beautiful days.

Rabat- According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), officials from both countries emphasized the need to improve bilateral cooperation in aeronautics. The reception was held in honor of the members of the Moroccan Aeronautics Skills Network (Aero MAC) in Canada. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada, Soraya Otmani, said that the aeronautical sector is “now one of the kingdom’s promising levers for growth and job creation.” She said that the sector is growing at “20 percent per year, which is four times higher than the global average for the sector.” She added that Morocco became the biggest exporter of aeronautical products from Africa in 2018. The diplomat said that Morocco’s need for human resources to support the growth of the aerospace industry will increase tenfold in the years to come. Otmani explained that a network of Moroccan skills in aeronautics in Canada will play a facilitating role for Morocco in its quest for attractiveness vis-à-vis foreign investors, especially Canadians. Morocco’s aeronautics industry saw rapid growth in the last decade. In 2017, aeronautical exports exceeded $1.2 billion and jobs increased by 50 percent from 2016. Several international aeronautics companies are active in Morocco.  The Montreal-based Bombardier company, the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, built a manufacturing facility in Morocco in 2014. Boeing also has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses, for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. In October, Morocco hosted a forum for skilled Moroccans in Canada in the aeronautics industry to get involved in the development of Morocco’s aeronautics. The first of its kind, the forum was held on October 5, in coordination between the Moroccan Ministry of Industry and the Ministry in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad. The forum convened 200 participants, cluding a delegation from Aero Montreal, Moroccan members of the Aero MAC, Canadian aeronautics experts, investors, institutional managers, and technical and financial partners. According to Morocco’s foreign exchange office, the Moroccan aviation industry earned more than MAD 9.78 billion in the first 11 months of 2017, compared to MAD 8.42 billion in 2016, an increase of 16 percent.

Rabat – The “territorial management” program, said the dean of the social sciences school, Abdelkrim Marzouk, will offer training for problems in local communities with awareness of geography, ethics, and social background.  The university also signed an agreement with the Moroccan Association of Presidents of Municipal Councils (AMPCC). In the second agreement, Al Akhawayn offered to train the presidents of local and regional councils, according to Mohamed Boudra, the president of the AMPCC.  Marzouk, who is also the head of the Executive Education Center at Al Akhawayn, said that municipal management skills are the key to improving the performance of local and regional representatives. Al Akhawayn, based in the Atlas Mountain city of Ifrane, had announced it would introduce an executive master’s in city management  designed for officials specializing in the management of regions. Al Akhawayn signed the agreements November 23 at the Africities Summit in Marrakech. Marrakech hosted the 8th Africities Summit November 20-24. The theme was the role of local governments in sustainable urbanization in Africa. The Africities Summit also discussed the 2063 Vision of Africa.

Rabat – Air passenger traffic rose by 20 percent during the first ten months of this year compared to the corresponding period last year. According to the National Office of Airports (ONDA), 4,275,000 travelers have used Menara Airport between January and October this year compared to 3,549,000 in the same months of last year. ONDA said 504,000 passengers traveled through Menara Airport in October, up 19 percent compared to the 422,000 passengers recorded during the same period last year. Menara International Airport accounts for 21 percent of all air traffic in Morocco, second only to Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, which accounts for 45 percent. The most popular non-domestic flight in Morocco in October was the Marrakech-Paris Orly flight, carrying 57,000 travelers, accounting for more than 2 percent of national flights. The flight between Marrakech and London Gatwick ranked fourth, with 35,000 passengers, accounting for slightly over 2 percent of Morocco’s total air traffic. Passengers at Menara Airport face lengthy lines at passport control upwards of three hours sometimes. One British traveler posted a scathing review on the airport’s customer feedback site earlier this month: “A beautifully dramatic airy building, but queue at immigration was completely unacceptable: the worst I’ve ever encountered in 35 years of flying regularly all around the world! It took us 3.5 hours to get from back of queue to an immigration officer’s kiosk.” Special offers by budget airlines Ryanair and Air Arabia and airport measures to end delays and long lines at immigration may continue to increase Menara International Airport’s passenger traffic.

The sources added that the compensation “was arranged so that the difference between the reported sum and actual compensation, totaling about 72 million dollars, would be paid to Ghosn after his retirement as a bonus, as well as consulting and other fees.” Kelly, according to NHK, admitted yesterday that “post-retirement payouts were arranged for Ghosn.” Kelly said, “Ghosn’s post-retirement payouts didn’t need to be reported in his securities statements since they were yet to be formally arranged,” sources told NHK. Japan requires high-income corporate executives to report their post-retirement payouts in their securities reports when the total sum is decided. People who violate Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act could face up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $88,500. Nissan’s board of directors ousted Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director on Thursday, November 22. Ghosn is also CEO of Renault and visited Morocco in October to review Renault’s plant expansion plans. In response to Ghosn’s arrest, Renault appointed COO Thierry Bollore as temporary CEO.

The visit will conclude with a signing ceremony for a series of agreements and memoranda of understanding. On Sunday, Morocco’s Princess Lalla Meryem, King Mohammed VI’s sister, received the Belgian princess as a representative of King Philippe of Belgium. The audience took place in the presence of Belgian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Didier Reynders. The delegation’s agenda includes discussions on trade, the signing of agreements, and collaborating on banking, eco-construction, and women’s entrepreneurship and technology, according to Belgian outlet Le Vif. Secretary of State for Foreign Trade Cecile Jodogne told the press before her departure to Morocco that “Brussels is at the forefront in these three sectors, which explains the interest of this mission, both on the Brussels side and on the Moroccan side.” Hub.brussels CEO Isabelle Grippa said that women are taking a key role in the trade mission and one in five people in the Brussels delegation is a woman.  During their trip, which will continue until November 30, the delegation will visit Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier. The Belgian economic mission is in line with Moroccan-Belgian determination to give a new impetus to diplomatic partnership and cooperation between Morocco and Belgium. The official trip also aims to boost trade between the two countries. During their visit, members of the delegation are also set to meet with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Morocco is Belgium’s 44th biggest export destination and its 61st import supplier, according to the Belgian Agency for Foreign Trade. The agency estimated exports of Belgian companies to Morocco at €889.7 million and imports at €332.8 million in 2017. The major Belgian exports to Morocco include base metals (22 percent), machinery and appliances (20 percent) and chemicals (15 percent). Moroccan exports to Belgium are primarily chemicals (40 percent), food products (10 percent), and textile products (10 percent), according to the Belgian agency. At the end of the first six months of 2018, Belgian exports to Morocco amounted to €439.3 million, representing a 2 percent increase over the same period of 2017. Meanwhile, imports of Moroccan products dropped to €172 million, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared to the same period of 2017. Last week, Belgian Ambassador to Morocco Marc Trenteseau said during a press conference for the event that bilateral trade is lower that its economic potential. He added that the mission’s main objective is to revive the economic relations of the two countries. Belgian business representatives also shared a positive view of Morocco’s economy, saying that it has undergone a profound transformation over the last 20 years. The visit was organized by the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Trade Agency in collaboration with Brussels Invest &amp; Export, Flanders Investment &amp; Trade, and the Walloon Agency for Export and Investment (AWEX).

Rabat – In a press release, the ministry said it has undertaken administrative measures to register and classify the Taza medina as a national cultural heritage site. The statement added that the Taza medina is one of the oldest cities in Morocco. According to the ministry, the old medina was part of historic civilization and has ancient architectural heritage. The initiative is part of the ministry’s strategy to safeguard and preserve the tangible and intangible national heritage. The ministry started the classification of historic buildings on the heritage list to inscribe the heritage in the overall development vision to preserve historic buildings, panorama, rock carvings, works of art, and traditions. The ministry’s project is also in line with King Mohammed VI’s instructions to improve Morocco’s old medinas. In October, the monarch chaired a ceremony focused on the sustainable restoration of Morocco’s walled cities. The ceremony marked the signing of four conventions of restoration programs to promote famous Moroccan destinations, including the coastal city of Essaouira and Marrakech. The government allocated MAD 2.35 billion for the restoration programs. The programs also aim to preserve Morocco’s architectural heritage and to honor cultural wealth.

Rabat – NASA’s InSight lander project is set to study the red planet if it lands successfully on Mars this evening, around 8:45 p.m. (Moroccan time). Oudrhiri told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that “landing on Mars is one of the most improbable scientific achievements in terms of global exploration, as the success rate is only 40 percent.” He added that a failure rate of 60 percent “obviously makes things complicated but also exciting if they succeed.” Oudrhiri said that the new scientific mission will study the internal composition of the red planet and that InSight has been equipped with seismometers and a heat flow sensor. Oudrhiri has worked for NASA for more than 20 years. He contributed to several key missions, including missions related to Mars exploration craft: Curiosity, Rovers, Spirit, and Opportunity. “We will be sitting anxiously at the Mission Control Center, nervous but also hopeful that all our efforts will pay off and that everything will eventually work out as planned,” he said. Oudrhiri also oversees the Cold Atom Lab (CAL) mission on behalf of the NASA space agency. The scientist has been recognized with several NASA achievement honor awards from the planetary scientific community. From Fez, Oudrhiri completed his graduate studies in space communication in the US. The scientist joined NASA in 1996.

Rabat – The president of the Rally of Algerian Hope (TAJ) party, Amar Ghoul, claimed that Morocco is sending “hashish and drugs” to Algeria. When journalists asked Ghoul, the former Algerian minister of tourism, about Moroccan-Algerian political ties in a press conference on Saturday in Algeria, the politician said, “Morocco is the big winner of the trade balance with Algeria.” He added that trade with Morocco is lopsided: “These people take our oil, our sugar, and all consumer products subsidized to billions of dollars. They send us hashish and drugs instead.” Ghoul’s statement came only a few days after the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an indirect reaction to King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer. While the Moroccan government showed interest in normalizing ties with Algeria, Morocco’s eastern neighbor called for a meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union foreign ministers to discuss issues hindering Maghreb unity. On November 6, the monarch called on Algeria to be involved in a direct and frank dialogue with Morocco to break the “stalemate” that hinders Maghreb unity. In line with the King’s offer, Moroccan political parties, including the Justice and Development Party (PJD), announced their intention to meet with Algerian parties. Some Algerian parties, including Ennahda, disapproved of the initiative, saying that the issue between Rabat and Algiers should be solved between the two governments and not between parties. Ghoul also accused Morocco of “throwing” irregular migrants into Algeria. He added that Morocco blames Algeria for expelling migrants. “Their representative at the UN then declares that it is the fault of Algeria.”  In October, the United Nations urged Algeria to “stop arbitrary expulsion” of migrants. The News24 outlet reported in July that Bouteflika’s government had resumed expelling migrants into the Sahara desert. Algeria has also previously accused Morocco of “flooding” Algeria of drugs. Most recently, in August, the former secretary general of Algeria’s National Liberation Front (FLN), Djamel Ould Abbes, claimed that Morocco brings “enormous quantities of drugs into the Algerian territory.” The claims were similar to several statements made by Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel in October 2017. Messahel accused Moroccan banks and airlines of transporting and selling cannabis. He also accused Morocco of “laundering drug money in sub-Saharan Africa.” Algeria, however, denies that mafias in its country have been marketing hazardous psychotropic pills in Morocco, including ecstasy.  In 2017, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that seizures of psychotropic pills from Algeria “witnessed a very alarming rise over the past years.” DGSN said that it confiscated 808,022 psychotropic pills in 2016, compared to 260,152 in 2015 and 293,282 in 2014.

Rabat – Omar, a Muslim woman of Somali descent who was elected at Minnesota’s fifth congressional district on November 6, announced her support for the move on her social media accounts. “No one puts a scarf on my head but me. It’s my choice—one protected by the first amendment,” Omar wrote on her Twitter and Instagram accounts. Omar added that “this is not the last ban she will work to lift.” The muslim congresswoman wears hijab, which runs contrary to the House of Representatives rules. Under the current 181-year-old-rule, a House member must be “uncovered” in order to address the floor, and cannot even enter the House “with his head covered.” Omar co-authored the proposal to lift the ban on head coverings along with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Jim McGovern. Omar will be the first woman to wear the hijab inside the House of Representatives. The Minnesota Representative will be along with the Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress. No one puts a scarf on my head but me. It’s my choice—one protected by the first amendment. And this is not the last ban I’m going to work to lift. https://t.co/7U3ZLTaWur — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) 17 novembre 2018

Rabat – About 53 sub-Saharan undocumented migrants were aboard, including eight women. The members of the royal navy found 15 dead bodies aboard the boat, which had been drifting for four days after an engine failure. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the members of the royal navy brought the migrants back to the port of Nador. In recent years, Morocco has been under constant pressure due to the flow of undocumented migrants who consider Morocco a transit country to reach Europe. The North African country has launched several operations to combat human trafficking networks. On October 30, the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested 26 suspected members of a criminal network in Oujda and Berkane in northeast Morocco.  The recent arrest dates back to November 23 in Tangier when members of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) dismantled a criminal network involved in irregular migration. In August, Morocco’s government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that Moroccan authorities had foiled  65,000 undocumented migration attempts in 2017. El Khalfi said that the number of undocumented migration attempts has increased in recent years, especially since 2016.

Rabat – Several videos shared on social media show MBS and his closest ally, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in what it appears to be a lounge. The videos also show both MBS and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, known also as MBZ, sitting in a dinner table accompanied by women.  The UAE was Salman’s first stop on his regional trip. He arrived in the UAE on Thursday and took part in the Formula 1 competition on Friday. Bin Salman’s visit was the first foreign trip after the murder of Saudi critic and Washington columnist Jamal Khashoggi.  Bin Salman announced a “world tour” to enhance diplomatic ties with Saudi allies. The prince’s tour, according to Riyadh, aims to improve ties with Saudi’s strategic partners. The Saudi Crown Prince aims to rehabilitate himself on the world stage and reassure world leaders of his ability to lead his country and put it on the right path towards modernization.  #مبس يوسّع صدره في أحد الملاهي الليلية بـ #أبوظبي💃 برفقة عرّابه ومعلّمه وسيّده #مبز تخلل ذلك التقاط الصور التذكارية مع السولعيات الحلوات الجميلات👌#هيه_بويه_الله_يحييك #ولي_العهد_في_الامارات pic.twitter.com/ezkKMKwDFH — عبدالله الوذين (@abqatar) November 24, 2018  سود الله وجهك

Rabat – Earlier this week, Riyadh announced that Mohammed bin Salman is planning to visit “strategic partners” to further reinforce diplomatic ties in different fields. In his party meeting held on Saturday, Makri said that the Saudi Crown Prince is responsible for “ the death of children and civilians of Yemen, the imprisonment of many preachers, jurists and men of culture in the Kingdom and, most recently, the assassination” of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Quoted by Algerian news outlet TSA, Makri said that bin Salman’s visit to Algeria is neither in “favor” of the country’s image “nor to its reputation.” He added that MBS is “attempting to reassure Algeria about the drop in oil prices,” recalling that Saudi Arabia responded to the request of US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices. Oil Prices have fallen this week from $68 per barrel to about $52.50 per barrel. Trump was extremely pleased, expressing his satisfaction in a tweet. Algeria is among oil producing countries affected by the drop in oil prices. The North African country relies heavily on oil to maintain its foreign currency reserves. Makri is not the only politician who criticized MBSs visit. Tunisian activists and politicians also called for protests to prevent bin Salman from visiting Tunisia. Al Jazeera reported that hundreds of people are expected to protest in front of the presidential palace in Carthage to express their condemnation over the MBS’s visit.

Rabat – Bin Salman is set to arrive in Tunisia on November 27, as part of his first tour abroad since the assassination of prominent Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Bin Salman, also known as MBS, is being widely viewed as the main culprit in giving the green light for Khashoggi’s assassination.  Tunisian government spokesperson Saida Qarash confirmed MBS’ visit to Tunisia via a local radio station, adding that her country condemns Khashoggi’s murder and calls for revealing the truth. Hundreds of people are expected to gather in front of the presidential palace in Carthage to express their opposition to MBS’s visit to the country, Tunisian activist Tarek Kahlawi told Al Jazeera. “It is a shame that Tunisia, which has witnessed a democratic transition and a revolution against tyranny and dictatorship, will receive a criminal whose hands were stained with the blood of Saudis and Yemenis,” he was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying. Hamma Hammami, spokesperson of the main opposition party, Popular Front, also denounced MBS’s visit and considered it as a “provocation to the Tunisian people and its revolution and principles.” On the other hand, a group of Tunisian lawyers have said they would fill a lawsuit at the request of bloggers and journalists who reject the Saudi crown prince’s visit. MBS is on a visit to several countries to strengthen Saudi Arabia’s relations internationally and regionally. Bin Salman arrived to Abu Dhabi on Thursday November 22, and will visit other Arab countries including Bahrain, Egypt, and Algeria.  The Saudi Crown Prince is due to attend the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of November, where he will meet with the world leaders, including the Turkish Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has accused him of being implicated in Khashoggi’s murder.

Rabat – The law will be discussed and approved in the Tunisian parliament before it goes into effect. The Tunisian president, Beji Caid Essebsi, launched the initiative in August last year on the occasion of the International Women’s Day. t, August 13, 2017. Many conservative Tunisians opposed the president’s move, arguing that it goes against the Quran which states that men should inherit the double of what women should. The president however stood by his initial move, saying that citizens in Tunisia will have the freedom of choosing to whether follow the Sharia Islamic Law or the constitution. Essebsi’s initiative, which was launched under the slogan “Equality: A Right, Not a Privilege,” was based on the Tunisian constitution that upholds ‘Citizenship, the will of the people, and the supremacy of the law.’ Essebsi’s insistence on gender equality , received heavy criticism in Tunisia and in other Islamic countries. Rights activists and the feminist movements in Morocco have also been calling for a reform in inheritance regulations.  Earlier this year, in March, Moroccan public figures, including university professors, lawyers, doctors, launched a petition to abolish the Ta’sib inheritance law. They argued that Morocco should adopt a rights-based inheritance law that preserves women’s right to equal treatment in inheritance.

Kenitra – The court gave lawyers Mohamed Ziane and Isaac Charia a six-month suspended prison sentence and a MAD-1000 fine for “informing against a crime they know did not happen,” Moroccan media reported. The court also ordered the two lawyers to pay MAD 500,000 as compensation for damages caused to El Omari. The case goes back to November 2017 when both Ziane and Charia accused El Omari of conspiring against the Moroccan monarchy by inciting Hirak movement activists, including Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, to destabilize the country through protests.  Following the lawyers’ accusations, El Omari, who was at the time secretary general of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), filed a lawsuit against Ziane and Charia. “It is very dangerous to accuse someone of plotting against his country, and I will not let go of this lawyer until justice is done,” El Omari said. “If I was targeted for my person, I would not have given any interest to these statements, but to be associated with maneuvers to destabilize my country and undermine its image, it is unacceptable,” he added. Both Ziane and Charia were members of the defense committee of detained Hirak activists when Nasser Zefzafi, sentenced to 20 years in prison, was still on trial. On November 21, Charia told the judge that his “client [Nasser Zefzafi] told me that El Omari had contacted him many times, inciting him and other Hirak activists to conspire against King Mohammed VI and the country.” Charia  added that he is ready to accept the court’s verdict  if his statements are proven wrong. When asked about his version of the events, Ziane said, “I already gave my opinion and testimony regarding the allegations made against El Omari.” “I am not and will not give up on a single word I said regarding this matter,” Ziane told the press in November 2017. Ziane added that Charia had “submitted 64 documents supporting his allegations against El Omari.” Reacting to the court’s decision, Ziane said he was surprised at the verdict. The lawyer said that he did not understand why the sentence was suspended and why the court refused to enforce the ruling immediately. Ziane, unapologetic, said that he will not change his mind about Ilyas El Omari. “I always think that El Omari has separatist tendencies and I will never change my mind.”

Rabat – Princess Lalla Meryem, chairwoman of the National Observatory for Children Rights, red the King’s message on Saturday. Here follows the full text of the royal message: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Mayors and Representatives of local governments, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I commend the “African Cities without Street Children Campaign” and its equivalent pilot initiative in Morocco, which is “Rabat: City without Street Children.” Of the 120 million street children in the world, more than 30 million are scraping a living on our continent. One in four street children in the world is therefore African. This figure is not only shocking, it also runs contrary to the time-honored values of our African societies, which are based on solidarity and the pre-eminence of the family. Just like other countries in Africa and other parts of the world, Morocco is unfortunately not immune to the problem of homeless children. Failure to recognize this challenge would be tantamount to willful blindness; moreover, it would be unreasonable to underestimate the phenomenon. Since my accession to the throne of my glorious Ancestors, my action has been grounded in a deeply held conviction: fate should not be invoked to justify resignation. To accept – through denial, capitulation or indifference – that children be abandoned to the street amounts to condoning, on a daily basis, an insult to our own humanity. Such an attitude is unacceptable! So, this is not just about celebrating the launch of a campaign, or starting one without seeing it through. We need to make sure concrete substance is given to the effective, structured and sustainable commitment of cities to reduce child vulnerability within a three-year period. Therefore my ambition, through this campaign, is to mobilize as many African cities and territories as possible so that tangible actions may be implemented and a concrete national and continental dynamic set in motion. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, There is national consensus in Morocco on promoting child-related issues. In addition to action by government authorities, there is also humanistic, resolute commitment on the part of civil society. In partnership with United Cities and Local Governments of Africa, and with the support of UNICEF, the National Observatory for Children’s Rights pledges to support this large-scale initiative. An expert follow-up committee can help institutionalize these commitments, monitor the actions undertaken in African cities and improve intervention tools for the benefit of children. At the domestic level, the mobilization of national stakeholders has already led to far-reaching legal, institutional, economic and social reforms. This has resulted in the adoption of the Integrated Public Policy for Child Protection in Morocco and of the 10-year framework of action, in addition to other initiatives, such as the Indimaj program, which is aimed at eradicating the phenomenon of children living or working on the streets. Child protection units and the ‘SAMU social’ provide emergency assistance, while second chance schools and vocational training institutes offer appropriate, sustainable solutions. Despite the commendable progress made, much remains to be done. Child protection is not merely about tackling the violation of children’s physical, moral and psychological integrity. It also implies creating the right conditions for their economic, social and cultural development. Protecting children is not just about preserving them from fear. It also means protecting them from want and creating conditions conducive to full respect for their rights. The challenge is as enormous as the stakes involved. Dignity, peace, poverty reduction, the eradication of hunger, the promotion of health care, a quality education for all, equality between boys and girls and access to drinking water and sanitation are important requirements that have a direct bearing on child protection. These are objectives and priorities which are at the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which serves as a real catalyst for international cooperation. It is up to us, Africans, to build on the global partnership around that Agenda in order to make progress towards sustainable development and the achievement of public well-being, particularly that of children. Rising to this challenge is within our reach. It requires awareness of what is at stake, a coherent, inclusive approach as well as immediate, effective mobilization of officials and elected representatives to make sure the rights of every child are respected. The proper place for children is in school, not on the streets. This much is clear: children’s education is a top priority. Education is actually where their protection starts. It must be at the heart of each one of our actions. Its multiplier effect is undeniable and its promotion a necessity. Education is our main challenge as well as our greatest chance. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, In my speech to the 29th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union in Addis Ababa, I stressed the imperative need to establish “a proactive, youth-oriented policy (which) can channel energy for the achievement of (the continent’s)development”. There never was a greater need for such a policy. The protection of African children should be one of its pillars. We should join efforts to combat abandonment, to which children too often fall prey in our African cities. The daily life of a child out on his own in the street is a journey full of pitfalls – his survival a never-ending concern. Left to grapple with misery and injustice, the child becomes an easy prey. He is often snatched away from the family home and exploited; he is subjected to ill-treatment and is exposed to drugs and juvenile migration risks. This shows how important it is for African cities and urban communities to be at the forefront of the struggle against the phenomenon of street children. Today, as this Africities Summit comes to a close, and given this issue on which many have simply given up, you – municipal leaders, mayors, elected officials and governors – should be mobilized and put child-related issues at the heart of decentralization policies, particularly those concerning street children. With this commitment in mind, I would recommend a change of perspective: which is to go back to direct contacts on the ground in order to come up with concrete, practical solutions. Issues relating to children are all too often put on the backburner. They must concern us all, be part of our common responsibility and become a priority for all of us. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, The future of our cities and of our nations hinges on what we offer our children today. Those of our children who are in precarious situations are not invisible. They are here, and they – too – are part of the future. Protecting children is everyone’s business, and welfare systems must be reinforced. I am pleased that most African sister nations have embarked on this journey, just as Morocco has done. We can increase our national capacities dramatically by pooling efforts at the regional and continental levels. This is the real meaning of this pan-African campaign for “African Cities without Street Children”, which aims to put child-related issues at the heart of the continent’s urban development policy. If Africa’s children are not protected, the continent will not rise successfully to the challenge of achieving its emergence. Without a more resolute protection of future generations, Africa will not capitalize on its demographic dividend. Now is the time for action. It is our duty to make sure African cities are truly worthy of their children. The time has come to put issues relating to children at the heart of the public agenda. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat- The Christian committee of the Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms is allegedly organizing a press conference to present a report on the situation of Moroccan Christians upon the Pope’s arrival. The association seeks to take Pope Francis’ visit as an opportunity to draw attention to the situation of Christians in Morocco. Moroccan Christians are a religious minority in Morocco. According to US State Department, Christian leaders in Morocco estimate there are 2,000 to 6,000 Christian converts in Morocco who try to keep a low profile, fearing social judgement. The Vatican announced on Tuesday, November 13, that the pope will visit Morocco on March 30-31, 2019. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI made the request, according to Vatican’s statement. “At the request of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and bishops, his holiness Pope Francis will visit Morocco for an Apostolic trip from March 30-31 2019. He will visit Rabat and Casablanca.” The pope’s visit will be the first time a Vatican Pope has come to Morocco in 33 years, after John Paul II visited the country during the late King Hassan II’s rule. Rumors about the Pope’s visit started to spread in May. At the time, some media reports relayed that a group of Moroccan Christian converts had even pondered to organize protests before the Parliament upon the Pope’s arrival. Though Article 3 of the kingdom’s 2011 constitution dictates the freedom to practice religious rituals, Moroccan converts to religions other than Islam fear social persecution.

Rabat – Morocco’s DGSN and Tangier’s judicial police have dismantled a criminal network involved in irregular migration. Using intelligence information provided by the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), the police arrested one alleged organizer and 1 intermediary on Friday evening. Following an investigation, the police also arrested 8 migrants, including 6 minors, a statement by Morocco’s General Directorate of National Safety (DGSN) indicated. Tangier’s police also uncovered equipment used for irregular migration, following the investigation. They seized 1 vehicle, 30 safety jackets, 1 pump used for inflating the boats, and a large sum of money in national currency. Police will undertake further investigations and interrogate the suspects to gather evidence and demonstrate any possible ramifications and links of the network in Morocco and elsewhere. The arrests are part of Morocco’s war on terror, organized crime, and all activities that threaten the country’s sovereignty and security. On October 30, the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested 26 suspected members of a criminal network in Oujda and Berkane in northeast Morocco. The network was making forged documents and was involved in irregular migration.

Rabat- The undocumented migrants sailed from Morocco’s Rif capital of Nador and were 11 miles from the coast of the Spanish enclave, Melilla. Their boat broke down as they were heading toward the southern shores of Spain.  The Spanish navy rescued all the migrants on time.  A Spanish rescue boat transferred the migrants to Melilla where they received the necessary health checks by a red cross team.  The rescued migrants including a young woman, were all Moroccan nationals.  The migrants are reportedly in good shape. Morocco and Spain are dealing with endless attempts by undocumented migrants to reach Spain from the North African country. The Moroccan government’s resolve to stem the flow of irregular migration by land and sea to Europe have not deterred many migrants, however.  In their determination to leave the country, a number of Moroccan migrants continue to travel by boat in the Mediterranean, sometimes at the risk of their lives.  Moroccans account for 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in the first nine months of 2018. In the same period, 7,100 Moroccans attempted to cross to Spain, according to official Spanish sources. In October, a statement by Moroccan authorities indicated that irregular migration attempts had surged by 150 percent along the western Mediterranean route from the levels recorded between 2003 and 2015. The Spanish Ministry of Interior estimated  that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with nearly 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” A joint report by Moroccan marketing agency Sunergia and Moroccan news outlet L’economiste established that an overwhelming number of Moroccans want to leave their country.  Interviewing 1,000 Moroccans, the study found that some 59 percent of Moroccan youth aged 15-24 said they would not hesitate to migrate irregularly.

Rabat – According to Morocco’s Foreign Exchange Office, Moroccan citizens spent a total of $1.7 billion on travel related expenses compared to $1.55 billion recorded during the same period last year. What Moroccans spend on foreign travel last October is a quarter of Morocco’s travel revenues, which kept rising all the same to reach $ 6,5 billion in the first ten months this year. According to the exchange office, this increase in expenditures on foreign travel, however, affects Morocco’s foreign currency reserve. The rise in Moroccans’ spending on international travel goes counter to Morocco’s challenge to double the number of local tourists through “Biladi” plan. Amine Touss, representative of a hotel in Marrakech, attributed the increase in foreign travel expenditures to the increasing special travel offers aiming to drag young people and middle class families. Amine added that there are still no tangible efforts to promote local tourism. Talking to the London based Alaraby, Mohammed Khalil, a travel agency representative, explained that part of the reasons behind this increase in foreign travels are the tempting vis-free countries such as Turkey and other Asian destinations, events like Russia’s last World Cup which encouraged football fans to make the journey and European countries such as Spain which received approximately half a billion Moroccans in spite of Schengen’s entry requirements.  According to Khalid, Moroccans total expenditures on foreign travel include their spending on Hajj and Umrah (Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) and studies abroad.

Rabat- Laayoune woke up Friday to pools of rainwater following the heavy rain that has swept the region and several others in the country. The floods filled the streets and buildings to the point where a school in the city had to align desks at its entrance for school children to walk on without the risk of drowning in the muddy rainwater.
 Casablanca and Rabat have also had their shares of floods and traffic disruption in recent weeks. Earlier in this month, the floods stopped Casablanca’s trams from operating from afternoon to night. Social media have been flooded by complaints about “poor infrastructure,” especially in Casablanca, Morocco’s overflowing economic city. Morocco is experiencing a cold snap and rainfalls early in the season.  Since October 28, temperatures have drastically dropped, leading to the first snowfall of 30 centimeters in the Atlas Mountain cities of Ifrane and Midelt, as well as the villages of Imouzzer, El Hajeb, and Boulemane. More rain is on the way for several regions in the country, as forecast by Morocco’s National Meteorological Directorate (DMN) on Saturday.

Rabat – The consulate added that the procedure is part of an “inevitable dynamic of modernization” in order to streamline public demand and improve the treatment of applicants, in Morocco and elsewhere. The new changes to the Schengen Visa application procedure will be implemented on  December 1. Applicants, including Moroccans, will no longer use the TLS Call Center during their visa application process. Instead, applicants will have to create an account on the France-Visas website to complete an online visa application through the TLS contact form. Explaining the new procedure, the consulate reassured applicants the appointment dates of people who sent their applications before December 1 will not be affected by the change. Another change that France introduced with this new procedure is the prepayment of TLScontact services which applicants can pay to any Wafacash agency provided they have the visa file number within t 72 hours of obtaining an appointment. The new payment service will allow managers to maintain control over the flow of requests and limit the “no-show” in reference to individuals who make appointment without showing up. The General Consulate added in a statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that a tutorial with more information will be posted in French and Arabic. together with China Morocco, along with China and Algeria is one of the three countries to which France grants the most visas. In 2017 alone, Moroccan applicants secured including 320,000 French, 85 percent of which were for short stays. The new procedure is part of France’s broader plan to attract international students to French schools and universities. According to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, the goal is to attract 500.000 students by 2027. In October, the French Agency for the Promotion of Higher Education, Hospitality and International Mobility, Campus France, ranked Moroccans as the largest foreign student community in France for the 2017/2018 academic year. The number of Moroccan students enrolled in French higher education institutions was estimated at 39,855 students during that period. This week, however, France announced that it will increase studies cost for international students. It remained to be seen whether the new studies expenses will affect the number of Moroccan students in France. France remains a popular travel destination for Moroccans, according to Jevoyage.ma. France’ popularity among Moroccans is due to “the advantage of accessibility, with frequent flights, in both regular and low-cost flights, which explain their success,”the website explained.

Rabat – Fifteen Moroccan intellectuals, including academic professors, authors and human rights activists, signed a petition on Thursday opposing Abdelkafi’s visit to Rabat. Sheikh Abdelkafi “is known for his extremist sermons that incite hatred towards the followers of the two religions,” said the group’s statement, referring to Judaism and Christianity. The 67-year-old preacher is expected to give two religious lectures on November 24-25 at the Mohammed V theater in Rabat. Al Joud Islamic association invited the preacher and organized the lectures. Titled “No to hatred and extremism,” the petition said that “nothing justifies the arrival of this controversial preacher to Morocco,” calling on organizers to “cancel the visit.” The signatories  also stressed Ablelkafi’s “admiration for the Nazi criminal Adolf Hitler.” The Egyption, the petition elaborated,  is a “misogynist preacher, known for his many sermons discriminating against the Muslim woman”. According to the group, Sheikh Abdelkafi’s visit constitutes an “insult to our non-Muslim fellow citizens, an affront to Moroccan women and a categorical denial of open and tolerant Islam.” Other intellectuals have called for restraint, declining to sign the petition. Renowned Moroccan author Mohammed Ennaji, who opposed the petition, argued that the controversial Egyptian Sheikh should be granted his right to exercise his freedom of speech. We should respond to the preacher “with analysis and criticism, not with prohibition, unless he calls for violence,” Ennaji wrote on his Facebook page.  An official of Al Joud association told AFP that the invitation is programed. There is “nothing hateful in the preaching of Sheikh Abdelkafi.”  The intellectuals also called on the Moroccan Ministry of Culture to “ensure that institutions under its supervision do not serve as a platform for events and stakeholders advocating extremism, hatred, racial or religious supremacy, exclusion, and violence “. The signatories included Moroccan authors and human right activists such as Ahmed Assid, Abderrahim El Jamai, Fouad Abdelmoumni, Abderrahim Jamai, and Driss Ksikes. Sheikh Abdelkafi has a large audience in the Arab and Muslim world.

Rabat – The study indicated that the Khemisset potash project has potential for a low capital cost and high margin potash mine, Emmerson said in a statement on Tuesday, November 20. The study estimates an initial extraction rate of 6 million tons of run of mine (ROM) ore annually, over a 20 year mine life, with an average grade over the life of mine of 9 percent of potassium oxide (K2O). Emmerson CEO Hayden Locke said that the findings represent “a very rare asset in the industry.” The scoping study gave a post tax net present value of $795 million and assumes a flat real price of $360 per ton. Using forecast prices from independent market consultant Argus Media, the net present value (NVP) increases to $1.14 billion over a 20-year mine life. “Potash is controlled by a small handful of companies and is an industry with high barriers to entry, predominantly in the form of extremely high capital cost. This means that few new players, if any, can ever enter the market,” Locke noted. Emmerson’s potash mine project is located in Khemisset, 85 kilometers east of Rabat, and benefits from its proximity to a number of port facilities. All products, according to the study’s assumptions, will be sold in Brazil, Northwestern Europe, NOLA, and South Africa. Using trucks from the mining site, the products will be exported via Mohammedia Port, near Casablanca. Khemisset “has an estimated capital intensity less than half of the global peer average, and less than a third of the average Canadian development,” Emmerson head said. The intensity “gives Emmerson a clear opportunity to be one of the few junior companies in the space.” According to British research house Align Research, “Khemisset has a large JORC [mineral resource classification] resource of Muriate of Potash (MOP), which is the most widely used and cheapest source of potassium.” “Fertilisers led by MOP are seen to be vital in improving the efficiency of farming.” Morocco is a “country where fertiliser giant OCP requires significant potash feedstock.” Morocco’s OCP Group is one of the leading exporters and producers of phosphate-based fertilizers in the world. The company develops precision agriculture techniques to help farmers improve the quality and yield of their crops. Potash is one of the main components used in fertilizers and modern agriculture as it can improve water retention, production output, as well as food crops’ nutrient value and disease resistance. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world will need to produce 70 percent more food for an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050. The increase, according to an FAO discussion paper, will also help combat “poverty and hunger, using scarce natural resources more efficiently and adapting to climate change are the main challenges world agriculture will face in the coming decades.”

Rabat – International media, including Jeune Afrique, reported that King Mohammed VI has “managed to convince” the family of the Gabonese president to transfer him to Morocco instead of London. Bongo was recently hospitalized in Saudi arabia. He spent nearly a month at King Faisal hospital in the Saudi capital following a stroke on October 24. His absence gave rise to several speculations. Some media even went as far as  announcing that Bongo may have died during hospitalization in the Saudi hospital. The president fell  ill in Saudi Arabia during his participation in the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh last month. Concern over the president’s extended absence was such that, earlier this week, Gabon’s top court ruled that Gabon’s Vice-President,  Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou, could take over in the absence of his boss. The court authorized Moussavou to chair the Council of Ministers and handle urgent matters in the country. It remained to be seen whether Bongo’s family will change their heart to transfer the ill president to Morocco for recovery. Bongo visited Morocco for several times. King Mohammed VI and Ali Bongo maintain good relationship. In 2017, the Gabonese president shared a picture of him and King Mohammed VI as teenagers, demonstrating the long-standing friendship between them. Local news outlets also said that King Mohammed VI  paid Odimba a private visit in December 2017.

Rabat – On Thursday, appearing to have put behind him the tense backlash of the Jamal Khashoggi saga, the Saudi crown initiated a scheduled series of diplomatic trips which the Saudi royal court has called “a world tour to enhance diplomatic relations with Saudi partners.” The United Arab’s Emirates (UAE), a staunch Saudi ally, was MBS’s first destination. Cheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nayhan, the UAE’s crown prince, warmly welcomed his Saudi counterpart in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. The Emirati prince tweeted afterwards: “Delighted to welcome our state guest, brother Prince Mohammed bin Salman. We’re proud of our deep-rooted ties. Close cooperation and a fruitful partnership lies in store for our countries. The UAE will always be a loving and supportive home for our brothers in Saudi Arabia.” According to Riyadh, MBS’s “world tour” testifies to the kingdom’s readiness to cooperate with “strategic partners” and “brotherly countries” to improve ties “in all areas.” As the tour comes just a week from the G20 summit to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, observers have been quick to suggest that MBS’s Arab tour is a pre-G20 summit exercise in high-profile public appearance. Earlier this week, the Argentinian government said that it was highly probable that MBS would attend the summit. “The prince is on the list of attendees and so far we have no information saying he is not coming,” the Guardian quoted Argentina’s presidential press adviser Pablo Di Nanno as saying. While Riyadh has not released details about MBS’s world tour itinerary, countries like Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Mauritania, and Tunisia have been said to be on the Saudi prince’s destination list following his Thursday premiere in Abu Dhabi. Quoting Algerian diplomatic sources, Algiers-based outlet TSA reported yesterday that authorities in the North African country “are preparing to host the Saudi crown prince in December.” While nothing certain has been shared about the date and the agenda of MBS’ visit to Algiers, “there is one certainty: the Saudi prince will soon come to Algeria,” the newspaper wrote. Meanwhile, Morocco, a traditionally strong Saudi ally, is conspicuous by its absence from the Saudi’s itinerary, leading to concerns over where the two kingdoms stand with each other in terms of strategic bilateral ties. In the buildup to the 2026 World Cup bidding process in June, Saudi Arabia sparked uproar in Morocco. In addition to voting for the US-led North American bid, the Saudi kingdom rallied a number of Arab countries in smashing Morocco’s World Cup aspirations. The Saudi move did not sit well with Moroccans, who, in great number on social media, called for a revision of Morocco’s diplomacy vis-à-vis Riyadh. In the meantime, observers suggested that Riyadh’s anti-Moroccan sentiments at the time were meant to punish Rabat for failing to follow suit with other Arab countries in the latest Gulf crisis that saw Saudi Arabia set up a blockade against Qatar. On November 18, Saudi Arabia appointed Abdullah bin Saad Al-Ghariri as the kingdom’s ambassador to Rabat. The move, coupled with a good personal relationship that Morocco’s Mohammed VI maintains with the Saudi king, was quickly seen as a further move to water don recent tensions between the two allies. But MBS’s deliberate snub of Morocco signals that Riyadh is yet to make peace with Morocco’s “constructive neutrality” in the Gulf crisis. Saudi Arabia has still not swallowed Rabat’s refusal to diplomatically isolate Qatar, many sources—diplomatic and academic—have concurred.

Rabat – Speaking at a press conference after the government council on Thursday, Mustapha El Khalfi said that the vote of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) ended the allegations that Morocco exploits the natural resources of Western Sahara, claims promoted by the opponents of Morocco’s territorial integrity.
 On November 21, AFET adopted the Morocco-EU agriculture deal. For Morocco, the vote reflects the positive position of political groups that represent the commission and the EU Parliament.
 El Khalfi said, “What is essential as a major message is that during the 2018 year, two fictitious allegations fell,” referring to Security Council Resolution 2440 and its decision to thwart Polisario’s “liberated zones” claims.
 The minister noted that the claim that the area in Western Sahara east of the defense wall was under the control of the separatist group has ended. He added that it was a Moroccan region and that responsibility for its management had been transferred to the UN MINURSO mission.
 El Khalfi emphasized that any illegal activity in the region is a “provocation and must be stopped.”
 He also said that the AFET vote in favor of the EU-Morocco deal contributes to the downfall of Polisario’s claim about Morocco’s “exploitation” of Western Sahara’s natural resources.
 Resolution 2440 urges Polisario to withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer strip and has called on the separatist group to stop any activity that might destabilize the status quo of the region. The resolution, voted on in October by the members of the UN Security Council, “further calls on the Frente POLISARIO to fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti,” which Polisario had claimed as liberated zones.
 Other EU commissions will discuss the EU-Morocco agricultural deal, including the commission of foreign trade and fisheries (INTA) before the final vote on the agreement.
 Besides the agriculture agreement, Morocco and the EU also agreed to renew their fisheries deal, which expired on July 14. The fisheries deal must pass through the EU Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states before entering into effect.

Rabat -Hedges was arrested at the Dubai airport on May 5 after a two-week visit to the country.  Hedges traveled to the UAE to complete research on Emirati security and foreign policy in the aftermath of the Arab Spring for his Ph.D. thesis. In October, UAE officials charged Hedges with espionage and forced him to sign a statement in Arabic, a language he does not speak, which prosecutors later used as a confession. Just 10 days before the sentencing, UK foreign minister Jeremy Hunt met with UAE officials, but the decision to sentence Hedges to life in prison apparently shocked UK officials. “Apparently [Hunt] was given assurances about Hedges’ fate and the likely outcome of the proceedings, those assurances appear to have been worthless,” an Al Jazeera reporter said.  In a statement released shortly after the verdict, Hunt said, “Today’s verdict is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances.” Matthew Hedges’ wife, Daniela Tejada, has become a vocal critic of how the UK has handled the matter, saying she pleaded with British officials to lobby the UAE to get Hedges out of solitary confinement. “They just disregarded my requests. They said that it wasn’t part of their job, that it wasn’t part of their duty.” The UAE released Hedges on bail in October, after four months of solitary confinement during which his health degraded significantly. Family members say Hedges was “vomiting daily” after prison officials gave him a cocktail of drugs throughout his detention. Prime Minister Theresa May, speaking to Parliament on Wednesday, said she was “deeply disappointed and concerned at today’s verdict.” Hedges has 30 days to file an appeal.  Durham University, where Hedges began his Ph.D. studies, also released a statement. “His academic colleagues speak highly of his work, noting both his diligence and level of scholarship, as well as his undoubted passion and care for the Arab Gulf and its people.” Lecturers at the University of Birmingham announced they will refuse to teach in Dubai and boycott the university’s UAE campus in the wake of Hedges’ sentencing.

Rabat – Nearly four months after announcing a draft bill to reinstate compulsory military service in Morocco, the government has added the service to the budget for 2019. The Administration of National Defense Minister Delegate Abdellatif Loudiyi recently gave a presentation before the members of the committees on foreign affairs, national defense, Islamic affairs and Moroccans overseas (MREs) to announce the budget allocated for the service. Morocco has allocated MAD 35.1 billion for its national defense administration. The budget has slightly increased (2.3 percent) as the government allocated MAD 34.3 billion for defense in 2018. The overall budget, according to Loudiyi, will help reinforce and modernize the defense and security plans of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) to protect national sovereignty and to defend the territorial integrity and stability of the country. The budget will also improve border surveillance. Loudiyi added that the allocated expenses will support social projects improve the living conditions of soldiers and their families. Sixty-nine percent of the overall budget will be dedicated to staff costs, according to Loudyi. The overall budget will cover the regulation of the administrative situation of military and civil servants on their promotion for the year 2019. The budget will be also pay the wages and allowances of conscripts for compulsory military service. The rest of the budget will be reserved for equipment, maintenance, and miscellaneous expenses. Other budgets will be allocated to maintenance and repair of equipment, water and electricity, fuel and the rental expenses of the Royal Gendarmerie’s houses. The budget will also cover expenses for military training for the Royal Armed Force. According to Medias24, which shared statistics from Loudiyi’s presentation, more than 19,500 trainees, including auxiliary forces, received basic military training in 2018. In recent years, Morocco has been upgrading its military services by acquiring new military equipment from its biggest supplier: the US. To “inspire patriotism,” Morocco announced its decision to reinstate military service for young Moroccan men and women. Parliament has not yet voted on the draft bill. Both men and women aged 19 to 25 would be subject to a 12-month military service, according to draft Bill 44.18 on compulsory military service.

Rabat- The new cover features the magazine’s trending headline “A look into the future,” next to the photo of the young princess adorned in a gold and vivid green caftan, her hair held with a tiara.  The princess, surrounded by purple petals and greenery, presumably at the Royal Palace, matched her caftan’s color with the magazine’s theme of youthfulness. Lalla Khadija started to accompany her parents, King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma, to social events at a young age.  The princess, born on May 28, 2007, as the King’s second child after Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan, has appeared with her mother, Princess Lalla Salma, at various events, such as the inauguration of the Children’s House Of Life In Casablanca in 2013, for children battling cancer.  On May 25, 2017, Princess Lalla Khadija took part in a ceremony with her mother, Lalla Salma, in Rabat. Lalla Salma received the gold medal of the World Health Organization (WHO) in recognition for her action and commitment to fighting cancer in Morocco and worldwide. On June 24, 2017, the princess participated at the graduation ceremony for the royal school at Casablanca’s Royal Palace. Then, Princess Lalla Khadija and her classmates staged artistic performances in Arabic, French, Spanish, English, Russian, and Chinese.  The princess also accompanied King Mohammed VI and the crown prince in an official ceremony in September on “supporting schooling and implementing the reform of education and training.”

Rabat – Renault made the offer to Posco “in early 2017 as part of its strategy to diversify its sources of steel,” a source acquainted with the affair told the South Korean Yonhap news agency Thursday. In response to Renault’s offer, Posco said the two companies will postpone “formal discussions” on the matter. Posco is not currently planning to enter Morocco, “citing market conditions,” the source said. Morocco World News contacted Renault to verify whether it made the offer to the Korean steelmaker. “We cannot give you any comment on this subject. We are always under discussion with many suppliers for further potential business,” a Renault spokesperson told MWN today. Renault is the third biggest customer of Posco’s automotive steel, Yonhap’s source said. Renault is also one of the biggest clients of ArcelorMittal, a leading steelmaker in the world, which supplies the French carmaker with automotive steel. According to Yonhap, Maghreb Steel, the leading steel producer of flat steel in Morocco, asked POSCO in 2017 to “invest in Morocco’s maker of flat steel products and provide necessary technology.” Morocco World News contacted Maghreb Steel, but the company has not yet provided any information about the offer. Posco “could use Morocco as a gateway for exporting its steel products to Europe without tariffs as Morocco has a free trade agreement with the EU,” Yonhap’s source said. The move could save the Korean steelmaker from a 25 percent tariff the EU said it would impose on 23 categories of steel products if imports surpass “the average of imports” for the last 3 years, after the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the tariffs in early 2019. Renault is one of the largest international companies in Morocco with two car manufacturing plants, in Tangier and Casablanca.  With a total of 35,365 sold units during the first semester of 2017, Morocco was the top automotive African market in terms of sales for the French group. The Moroccan Society of Automotive Construction (SOMACA) plant in Casablanca launched an extension project to the Renault plant in Casablanca in October. The extension project is set to double the plant’s production to 160,000 vehicles per year by 2022. “In 2018, over 400 000 Renault and Dacia vehicles will come out of our two plants. Groupe Renault counts more than 11 000 employees in the country and over 40 suppliers  and partners chose to follow us, creating 50 000 jobs locally,” according to Carlos Ghosn, Renault CEO and chairman. Japan has since arrested Ghosn for financial misconduct, and Renaut appointed COO Thierry Bollore as temporary CEO. The French car manufacturer achieved 65 percent of its goals to expand its ecosystem in Morocco in 2017, according to Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy.

Rabat – Based on the idea of bringing together actors—academics, civil society, decision makers—with separate agendas on migration and sustainable development, the forum aims to bring greater visibility to questions that are not generally raised in public debate around intra and transcontinental human mobility. The forum’s theme, “Honoring International Commitments to Unlock the Potential of All Migrants for Development,” highlights the increasing need to move away from narratives that portray migrants as simply victims or a burden for their host societies. The forum underscores a necessary shift from political discussions on migrants’ lives to a legal framework to implement policies and actions that acknowledge migrants’ contribution to development. The “provisional program,” which organizers shared with Morocco World News, speaks volumes about the crucial importance that migration and migrants’ lives have become for policy making and public debate in the fast-moving and globalized realities of today. But also in Moroccan public debate. From legal inclusion of migrants to improved treatment of undocumented immigrants, the forum’s organizers hope to offer a more comprehensive picture of the complex and sometimes confounding realities of global migration. Discussions will center on devising a “Euro-African approach” to inspire “multi stakeholder action” while at the same time steering away from the “North-South paradigm.” As debates rage on the North-South dimension of transnational mobility, the Marrakech forum aims to tackle migration-linked issues from a joint South-North and South-South platform that emphasizes shared responsibilities and common challenges. But immigration also advantages both host and native nations, suggested the program. The diaspora’s social engagement and remittances, sustainable and expansive citizenship, and the interaction between brain drain and “brain gain” will be among the topics that the forum’s participants are set to tackle during the three-day course of the event. The forum will close its doors with “official handover of chairmanship from Morocco and Germany to Ecuador.” Just 3 days after the GFMD event, the city of Marrakech will also host a two-day UN-sponsored “intergovernmental conference on the global compact for migration.” While having a more political focus than the GMFD, the intergovernmental conference upholds GFMD’s concerns with the legal and social inclusion of migrants in their host countries. According to the UN, the conference seeks to commit the international community to a global agenda on the protection of migrants’ rights. The GFMD forum will take place at the Palmeraie Conference Center.

By Zakaria Oudrhiri Rabat – The drop change is the result of a 0.5 percent decrease in the food index and a 0.1 percent increase in the non-food index, according to the High Commission for Planning (HCP) report. The drops in food products from September to October 2018 are mainly due to lower fruit prices with drops of 4.6 percent, fish and seafood with 3.1 percent, and meats with 0.5 percent. Prices increased by 1.4 percent for vegetables and 0.2 percent for mineral waters and soft drinks. For non-food products, the increase mainly concerned fuel prices which rose 1.5 percent. Declines in the CPI were most significant in Agadir and Al-Hoceima with 0.4 percent; Fez, Kenitra, Rabat, and Beni-Mellal with 0.3 percent; and Tetouan, Meknes, and Laayoune with 0.2 percent. In contrast, increases were recorded in Settat and Safi with 0.3 percent and in Guelmim with 0.2 percent.  Compared to the same month of the previous year, the consumer price index rose by 1.1 percent in October 2018 as a result of the 2.0 percent rise in the non-food products index and the 0.8 percent fall in the food products index. For non-food products, the variations range from an increase of 0.3 percent in communication to 6.5 percent in other goods and services. The underlying inflation indicator, which excludes products with volatile prices and products with public tariffs, increased by 0.1 percent in October 2018 compared to September 2018 and by 0.7 percent compared to October 2017. The CPI measures changes in the average price level of goods and services consumed by households, weighted by their share of average household consumption.

Rabat – Following an open session Thursday, November 22, in Marrakech during the Africities 2018 summit, participants reached a consensus that Marrakech is eligible to become the first African Culture Capital, thanks to its architectural, artistic, and cultural legacy. UNESCO designated Marrakech’s medina (old city) a World Heritage Site in 1985 and named the Jemaa el–Fna Square an Intangible Heritage in 2001, and the city has substantial tourism infrastructure. Marrakech has become a frequent venue for international events. “Marrakech aims to use its quality infrastructure to serve the ambitions of the African continent,” Mohamed Larbi Belcaid, the city mayor told local outlet Kech 24. Khalid Tamer, the secretary-general of the organizing committee of the African Capitals of Culture considered Marrakech as the launch pad for the African Capitals of Culture project leading to sustainable and human urban development. The Africities 2018 summit, which aims to address major questions based on the African Union’s Agenda 2063, opened in Marrakech on November 20, 2018, under the patronage of King Mohammed VI.  The summit features open sessions, political sessions, special events, and live discussions involving 5,000 participants, 750 mayors, 500 exhibitors, 35 ministers, and 40 partners from 2,500 cities and local governments.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The Africities summit is currently taking place in Marrakech. The Africities summit convened  communities and local authorities from African countries. AUI, which is among participants in the event, announced it would now offer a new collaborative master’s course in city management to African students. The course will focus on development, local administration skills, and studying administrative decentralization patterns in Africa. AUI announced they are appealing to both professors from Moroccan and international professors from the US, Europe, and other African countries to add their knowledge and experience to the course. The curriculum will consist of interactive and practical assignments, as well as cross-country exchange opportunities. After 12 months of study, students will earn a city management master’s degree from Al Akhawayn. King Hassan II founded AUI in 1995 by royal decree. Money given by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to clean up an oil spill off of Morocco’s coast was used to establish the university.  Ever since, AUI has become a top-tier institution with degrees in humanities, social sciences, engineering, and business administration. The university also formed educational partnerships with foreign countries, and on a recent ranking of Arab universities, AUI ranked first in Morocco. AUI hopes to prepare current and future city officials to tackle development and growth challenges facing the African continent.  Africa is the poorest continent on earth, containing 18 of the poorest countries based on per capita GDP, according to Business Insider. However, experts predict Africa’s population to grow exponentially in the 21st century, and countries hope to have a team of trained officials ready. Africities will close on November 24.

Rabat – In a press release quoted by Algeria’s state-run news agency APS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it has “officially contacted the general secretary” of the AMU to convene a meeting of the Union’s Foreign Affairs Ministers Council. The statement is the most direct response Algeria has given to Morocco’s dialogue offer announced by King Mohammed VI during his Green March speech on November 6. The foreign ministry said it had informed Maghreb countries of the meeting. The ministry emphasized the need to re-launch the “building of the whole Maghreb.” Analysts say the Algerian move seeks to divert attention from Morocco’s offer, which called for a direct dialogue between Rabat and Algiers. The Moroccan position is based on the premise that any multilateral initiative to relaunch the Maghreb would be doomed to failure as long as two key countries of the region, Morocco and Algeria, have not decided to open a new chapter in their bilateral relations.  In his speech, King Mohammed VI called on Morocco’s eastern neighbor to engage in a “frank and direct” dialogue to break the stalemate between the two countries. He also called for a mechanism to normalize diplomatic ties between the two countries. In his offer the monarch said: “I should like to refer to the division and lack of unity in the Maghreb. This unreasonable situation is utterly inconsistent with the brotherly bonds uniting our peoples, who share the same religion, language, history and destiny.” King Mohammed VI’s offer received nods from international powers, including the UK, US, France, and the UAE. The United Nations and the African Union also welcomed Morocco’s initiative dialogue with Algeria. Following the speech, the secretary general of the AMU also commended the King’s initiative. The secretary general of the AMUsaid that the proposal would ensure integration in the Maghreb. The secretary general also called on Algeria to accept Morocco’s offer.  Since November 6, Algeria has not issued any official statement in response to Morocco’s offer. However, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said in a congratulatory message to King Mohammed VI for Independence Day that his country has “firm determination” to reinforce the ties of fraternity and solidarity uniting the two peoples. Besides Bouteflika’s formal congratulatory cable, Algerian media also quoted an anonymous diplomat and an authorized source, who said that Algeria might accept Morocco’s dialogue initiative with conditions.

Rabat – The merchant vessel Fuji Bay arrived at the Gloucester Marine Terminal, Gloucester City, New Jersey, on November 16, carrying more than 4,000 pallets of tangerines, clementines, lemons, and mandarins. The citrus shipment came through a new partnership with Seatrade, which allows the fruit to be brought to the U.S.  Canadian supermarkets will acquire 75 percent of the citrus, while the rest goes to U.S. markets. The president and CEO of Holt Logistics, and the operator of Gloucester Terminals LLC, Leo Holt, expressed joy regarding the Moroccan citrus. “It is our distinct pleasure to welcome our new shipping partners in Maroc Fruit Board to Gloucester,” said Holt.  “A diversified supply chain means more competitive prices for our customers, and we are excited to bring seasonal Moroccan citrus products to the U.S. and Canadian markets,” he added. The fruit was shipped through Agadir Commercial Port on November 5 by Maroc Fruit, a conglomerate of growers who export about 300,000 tons of citrus and vegetables annually. Maroc Fruit will continue to supply the two markets with two shipments weekly until April, the end of citrus season in Morocco.

Rabat – When it comes to travel safety, any tourist may ask: is Morocco safe as most European countries, the US, and Canada?  The reassuring answer is that Morocco has a low risk level, according to the 2019 Travel Risk Map. The North African country maintained this level over the last three years. Iran, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait, are also among the low risk countries in the Middle East. The map listed five categories of travel security risk: insignificant, low, medium, high, and extreme. All Moroccan cities are low risk except for Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara, which are designated a medium risk status. Morocco is the only country to have a low risk level in North Africa. Algeria and Tunisia are medium risk, while Egypt is high risk. The Travel Risk Map 2019 helps organisations and travellers better understand the risks in the destinations where they operate and travel. The travel security risk rating is based on the actual threat posed to travellers by political violence, namely terrorism, as well as social unrest and crime. The danger level also takes into consideration other factors such as “the robustness of the transport infrastructure, the state of industrial relations, the effectiveness of the security and emergency services and the country’s susceptibility to natural disasters.” The Ipsos MORI Business Resilience Trends Watch 2019 report shows that 43 percent of business decision-makers expect travel risks to rise in 2019, according to The Independent. “Although some 47 per cent think risks have increased over the past year, this represents a 16 per cent decrease from 2017, when 63 per cent said risk had increased.” Countries with extreme risk levels were mainly countries in Africa and the Middle East including Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya, South Sudan and Somalia. Very few countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Luxembourg are among the “insignificant” travel risk category. When it comes to road safety, however, Morocco is shown to have a high risk status. This could be mainly due to the high number of accidents in the country. Between January and May 2018, some 1,052 traffic accidents occurred, according to a provisional toll issued by the National Committee for the Prevention of Traffic Accidents (CNPAC). Most countries in Africa and the Middle East are in either the “high” or “very high” risk category for road safety, except for Egypt which is at a “moderate” level. The Medical Risk Map shows that Morocco is a medium risk country alongside Tunisia, Egypt in North Africa, whereas Algeria has a high medical risk level. European countries are designated a low risk status, while Eastern European countries are medium risk. International SOS rates medical safety according to a range of health risks and mitigating factors including infectious diseases, environmental factors, emergency and dental service, access to quality prescription drugs, medical evacuation, and language, or administrative barriers. International SOS released the map in collaboration with Control Risks and in conjunction with the Ipsos MORI Business Resilience Trends Watch 2019 report.

By Zakaria Wadghiri Rabat – VFM is directed by Brahim EL Mazned, who is also the artistic director of Timitar Festival of World Music. Fondation Hiba, founded by Hit Radio CEO Younès Boumehdi, and Association Atlas Azawan, an Anna Lindh Foundation association, sponsor the event in partnership with Andalusian classical singer Nabyla Maan. VFM has both economic and cultural aspects and a bit of tourism too.  Venues are all within walking distance of each other and they are all historical sites in Rabat. The event features every style of Moroccan music from classical tarab music to emerging rap and alt music.  Although the event touches on tourism, no tourism or cultural public body sponsored it. The only official sponsor is the Rabat Governorate (Wilaya). VFM is not a profit-driven event but a structuring project for the local music sector. The point is to create a music market in Africa and the MENA region.  Many musical events take place in the Kingdom but most focus on the importation of musicians, which does not help the local music scene. Another of the event is to help Moroccan musicians export themselves.  Inter-cultural exchange is a necessary condition for artists to export themselves and hence the idea of VFM makes sense. African and Europeans radios will be present. The 2017 VFM did not receive funding from the ministry of culture, although they made promises to fund the 2018 event, according to the organizers. The official list of performers includes:  The festival will see the launch of the new collaborative music website auxsons.com in the presence of Amandine Saumonneau, coordinator of the Paris-based international musicians network Zone Franche. Visa for Music started in 2013 to bring Afro-Middle Eastern artists to the global stage, through a series of performances, showcases, conferences, speed-meetings, workshops and trainings.

Rabat- The trial of street artists Badr Mouataz, 25, and Mehdi Achataoui, 28, began today.  The young men’s lawyer, Youssef Chehbi, announced that the officers all withdrew their complaints and the court is set to issue its judgement later in the day. Several activists and people on social media called on authorities in Casablanca to release the young musicians, considering their arrest a “violations of their rights as artists.” On November 13, the Casablanca police arrested Mouataz and Atachatoui, who were performing at the United Nations. Both  artists are known for various street performances, andthey face charges for “practising violence against civil security forces on duty.” The two musicians reportedly lost their cool after the police officers tried to seize their musical instruments. The musicians were caught off guard when the wali (governor) of Casablanca, Abdelkebir Zahoud, decided to ban street art performances in the area.  The decision came after residents complained about loud music causing a disturbance. A number of musicians  organized a sit-in last week at the square, where they held  banners that read, “The ban is not a solution” and “Street art in silence?” Hashtags, namely “#FreeMusiciens” and “#Free_Lfen” (Free art), have emerged online to denounce both the ban on street performances and the arrest of the musicians.  Many Moroccans also opposed how the authorities and complaining residents described music as “noise,” noting that street performances bring fun and many streets around the world are stages for young, talented performers.

Rabat – According to a statement by the general staff of FAR, the field hospitals will be implemented at the request of King Mohammed VI. The hospitals will provide help to the inhabitants of the two regions in order to combat the significant temperature decreases that have been forecasted across Morocco. The statement added that the deployment operations will begin as early as Friday, November 23. Earlier this month, the King also gave instructions to the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity to mobilize against the cold wave in central Morocco. The first phase was launched on November 3 in the Midelt region. The initiative provided humanitarian assistance to regions affected by the cold weather. The Foundation conducted a medical campaign in the town of Boumia, which is located in the Midelt province in the Drâa-Tafilalet region. The  campaign offered medical services, including general medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, maternal health, dentistry, ophthalmology, biology, radiology, and screening for physical disability in order to manufacture the appropriate equipment, according to the statement. Launched in  2003, the Foundation has carried out a total of 894 campaigns, benefiting 1,066,608 people.

Rabat – Arton’s Capital, a Canadian consulting firm, has just ranked  Morocco’s passport at 64th in the world based on the number of countries Moroccans can travel to visa-free.  The study looked at 193 UN nations, as well as six regional passports, to determine the world’s strongest passport, reports news sources.  The Moroccan passport in 2018 enables Moroccans visa-free access to 30 countries, as well as the ability to obtain a visa on arrival in 38 countries. The Moroccan passport has added three more countries to its list of visa-free destinations, compared to the 2017 study done by Arton’s Capital. A separate study published by Gulf news earlier this year showed Morocco in the upper half of Arab nations based on passport power.  Tunisia, the only non-Gulf nation to score higher than Morocco in the report, also outranks Morocco by two places in Arton Capital’s 2018 report. Morocco’s stable government, alongside its increasing involvement in foreign business and diplomacy with Asia and Europe, contributed to the country’s improved passport ranking.  Gulf countries, with the exception of Yemen and Israel remain the MENA region’s strongest in terms of passport power due to strong political and economic ties with western countries.  Singapore and Germany tied for first in this year’s report. The US came in second, tied with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Norway, and South Korea.  On the other end of the spectrum, Afghanistan had the weakest passport in the world, with visa-free access to only five countries. Iraq scored the lowest among Arab nations, with visa-free access to seven nations.

The two Dutch men of Moroccan descent are alleged as leaders of “Mocro Maffia,” the Moroccan mafia in the Netherlands.” The two men have been the subject of a continental search warrant. Dutch authorities had previously placed a €25,000 for any information leading to the arrest of Taghi.  Lately, however, Dutch outlet RTL Nieuws reported an increase in the reward for information that may help to arrest anyone of the two wanted gang leaders. The reward has now jumped to €100,000 for each suspect. The two suspects, who are believed to have carried out assassinations in the Netherlands in recent years, are reported to be hiding abroad and moving regularly by using fake IDs. On October 27, a Dutch-Moroccan man, Hamza Ziani, was shot 9 times by a masked man while eating at a restaurant with a foreign couple in Spain. The killer immediately fled the scene in a white van.  The 33-year-old victim who died later at the hospital was part of a rival criminal network to Mocro Maffia.  Dutch authorities linked the assassination to Taghi, who is also suspected of ordering the shooting of Café La Créme that occurred on November 2017 in Marrakech. Moroccan police arrested the two Dutch individuals responsible for the shooting along with Taghi’s two brothers who are believed to have helped them.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The United Nations Industrial Development Organization voiced its support for the construction of the Zenata eco park, planned to be near Casablanca. Planning for the city began in 2006 between King Mohammed VI and the Deposit and Management Fund (CDG).  Creation of the Zenata Company (SAZ) began the same year, according to the company’s website. Zenata is Morocco’s first eco city to be built, but construction has moved at a slow pace since the project’s inception. UNIDO released a statement of support for the project on Monday, restoring hopes that the project will now have a timely completion date. The eco-city is part of  Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan 2014-2020 being supported by UNIDO. UNIDO is a Swiss-funded global program, and one of its missions is the support of eco-cities around the world, the organization’s website, noted. SAZ is planning for the city to hold 300,000 inhabitants and create 100,000 new jobs. Jobs will come from the large number of business opportunities included in the initial plan.  The plans include an integrated medical center, a university campus, and a shopping center. The city’s shopping center is set to t include an IKEA and will be the largest shopping center in Morocco, global development site Devex reported. The city is part of a larger agreement, Morocco’s Programme for Country Partnership, between UNIDO and Morocco. An eco-city’s goal is to promote businesses development and residency while maintaining a low level of carbon emissions compared to conventional cities.  The Zenata eco-city plans to keep its carbon footprint low by using the area’s natural resources and constructing ecological corridors to maintain natural flora and fauna. Thirty percent of the city is planned to be ecological “green spaces,” and natural cooling will occur through winds from the Atlantic, says city planners.

Rabat – The new Saudi ambassador to Morocco recited the oath before King Salman of Saudi Arabia along with 10 newly appointed ambassadors,. Al-Ghariri  comes in replacement of Abdelaziz Mohieddine, who took office in 2016. Morocco and Saudi Arabia maintain good diplomatic ties despite recent tension after the Saudi government decided to vote for United 2026 during the 2026 World Cup bid in June. Before the vote, Turki Al-Sheikh,Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority chairman, expressed anti-Moroccan sentiments. Saudi Arabia’s decision to sink Morocco’s World Cup aspirations to host the 2026 World Cup  resulted from Raba’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar. Al Sheikh tweeted: “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. Following the vote, however, King Mohammed VI and King Salman exchanged letters to reiterate their country’s commitment to reinforcing diplomatic ties. In September, the Moroccan monarch addressed a congratulatory message to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his country’s 88th National Day. The King expressed his “profound pride” in the bonds of sincere fraternity and mutual esteem “which bind us personally and unite our two royal families.” In a similar message, King Mohammed VI also invited King Salman to Morocco. King Salman is known for spending his summer holidays in Morocco. This year, however, the Saudi King ditched Morocco  while making his holiday plans. He summered  in Saudi Neom to inaugurate a project to create more job opportunities in the country’s technology and tourism sectors. The decision sparked speculations that Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between Qatar and the Saudi-coalition was the reason behind King Salman’s change of summer destination.

Rabat – El Othmani said that the Mohammed VI B satellite, which was launched on Tuesday night, is a “Moroccan achievement to be proud of.” He added that the satellite will provide information related to national security. Morocco, El Othmani stressed, seeks to maintain an independent approach information obtention and monitoring. “Mohammed VI-b satellite would provide pure Moroccan information that belongs to Moroccans and will not be acquired from others,” El Othmani said. The satellite separated from its airspace VEGA rocket at 2:42 a.m. Moroccan time on Tuesday night from the spaceport in French Guiana. Like Morocco’s first satellite (Mohammed VI-A), the satellite will be used for mapping and agricultural monitoring. The satellite will also help Morocco to have a better surveillance over its territory. The new satellite is set to be complementary to Mohammed VI-A and will enable  faster surveillance coverage. During the government council, El Othmani also commented on the launch of Morocco’s high speed train (LGV). Referring to the the LGV’s affordable prices,  El Othmani said that the high speed train is an “important technological achievement that will have a great impact on development, because it facilitates travel not only for businessmen and investors, but also for the public.” . According to El Othmani, the launch of the LGV is “the beginning of further technological development in the field of transportation within the country.” “We can cherish these achievements and learn more, because Morocco, thank God, has taken its technological path, and the many prizes that a number of Moroccans receive in international competitions,” he said. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI inaugurated Africa’s first LGV with French President Emmanuel Macron on November 15. Depending on three peak periods—low, normal, or high—second-class tickets cost MAD 93-139 for Tangier-Kenitra, MAD 115-172 for Tangier-Rabat, and MAD 149-224 for Tangier-Casablanca.

Rabat- The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) released Tuesday, on World Children’s day, the Global Education Monitoring report for 2019, entitled: “Migration, displacement and education: Building Bridges, Not Walls.” Noting that Morocco hosts large communities of undocumented immigrants, the study assessed the achievements of countries in ensuring the right to quality education for refugees and migrant children.  UNESCO asserted that although Morocco’s law N0.4 limited access to education only to Moroccan children, the 2011 Constitution came to recognize the right to education for all children in the country. The report estimated the number of undocumented child African immigrants enrolled in Moroccan schools in 2015-2016 at 7,500.  The study asserted that Morocco’s Ministry of Education opened access to education for children from sub-Saharan African countries in 2013, albeit some required documents that are somewhat “difficult to meet.” The report gives the example of the Casablanca-Settat’s Regional Academy of Education and Training requiring medical certificates for enrolment in schools, especially for migrants from countries affected by the Ebola virus epidemic. Less than half of undocumented migrant children aged 8 to 17 years old received in Casablanca, Rabat and Tangier centres attended school in 2014. The study argues that changes in country policies affect the education of the children and hinder the progress of the full inclusion of migrant children in national education systems. While accurate statistics on sub-Saharan migrants aiming to settle in Europe are “difficult” to estimate, the report notes, there is an increasing number of sub-Saharan migrants who remain in transit countries, such as Morocco. Over the past years, the number of undocumented migrants has steadily increased in Morocco, especially from sub-Saharan African nations. According to Pew Research Center, sub-Saharan Africans have accounted for 8 of the 10 fastest growing international migrant populations since 2010. The 2017 World Bank Report noted that the Moroccan Foundation for Financial Education, in partnership with the International Labour Organization, opened financial education programmes and conducted “qualitative surveys before developing the training to ensure the toolkit met the needs of both migrants and their families.” Many countries exclude migrants and refugees from their national education systems. Countries like Australia, Hungary, Indonesia, and Malaysia provide limited access to education for the migrant children.  “Half of the world’s forcibly displaced people” are under the age of 18, yet the countries holding the asylum-seeking children in detention, including Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Karen refugees in Thailand and many Afghan refugees in Pakistan, could only find a small space in private schools or community-based institutions, UNESCO emphasized. “Everyone loses when the education of migrants and refugees is ignored. Education is the key to inclusion and cohesion. Increased classroom diversity,” states the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay. Despite challenges teachers face in regard to classroom diversity, it is “ an opportunity to learn from others. It is the best way to make communities stronger and more resilient,” Azoulay said.

Rabat – The UK and Ireland focused oil and gas exploration company will invest over $1 million to fund a two-year venture. The move entails a new offshore exploration licence in Morocco, according to a company statement. The London-listed firm is currently negotiating the exploration licence with the National Office of Hydrocarbon and Mines (ONHYM), Morocco’s petroleum-related operations regulator. The company is expecting to complete the agreement with ONHYM between December 2018 and January 2019. EOG expects to begin exploration program in March 2019. The first year of the program will include “3D seismic PSDM [Pre-Stack Depth Migration] reprocessing.” The second year “will focus on building of a new prospect inventory and securing a farm-out partner in order to fund the drilling of an exploration well in the subsequent exploration phase of the licence.” PSDM is a seismic  instrument that captures images with geological structure while defining faults and and estimating depths with high accuracy. Europa Oil &amp; Gas CEO Hugh Mackay said, “We are delighted to have completed a fully subscribed Placing and are pleased to welcome new institutional investors as significant shareholders in Europa.” Speaking about the company’s new venture in Morocco, Mackay said, “The funds raised will enable us to deliver the work programme for a potential new licence in Morocco and to screen and land other new ventures.”  The investment is part of an approximately $6.44 million fund that EOG has raised  to fund its Irish Atlantic Margin projects and its new venture in Morocco. “The Fundraising has been undertaken to provide funding for Europa’s near-term work programme, to fund new venture opportunities and to provide working capital to the Company,” reads part of the company’s statement. Mackay believes that funds raised “will enable the company to continue to advance its high impact exploration portfolio in Atlantic Ireland and in particular to bring our high-graded prospects to the point of being ready to drill.” Founded in 1995, Europa Oil &amp; Gas is a leading explorer in Atlantic Ireland with six exploration licences. Three onshore UK oil fields produce currently about 95 barrels of oil daily . The company’s assets and activities are located in the UK, Ireland and France.

Rabat – Nissan’s board members made the decision through a unanimous vote during a meeting at Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported today. The seven-member board also dismissed Greg Kelly as representative director. On Monday, Nissan said that its CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, would propose immediately ousting the 64-year-old  Ghosn who has led Nissan for about 20 years. Mitsubishi is also preparing to dismiss Ghosn from his positions next week. Renault decided to keep Ghosn as company’s chairman and CEO after an emergency meeting that the board of directors held on Tuesday. The French carmaker has appointed the company’s chief operating officer, Thierry Bollore, as temporary deputy CEO, granting him the same powers as Ghosn. Japan has been arresting Ghosn since Monday for alleged financial misconduct of underreporting his salary by $44 million over five years since 2011. The misconduct also included “personal use of company assets.” On Wednesday, the Tokyo District Court approved a request from the prosecutors’ judicial authorities to extend the detention of Ghosn and Kelly by ten days. Ghosn’s arrest caused a shock in the automotive industry, especially because Ghosn, who leads the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, is considered a highly influential executive within the global automotive industry. The alliance sold over 10 millions vehicles worldwide in 2017. On Tuesday, Nissan’s shares fell by 5.45 percent, while Mitsubishi went down by 6.85 percent. On Monday, Renault shares tanked more than 8 percent in European trade. On Tuesday, Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said the alliance would be hard to manage without Ghosn, according to Reuters. “I don’t think there is anyone else on Earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,” Masuko told the press in Tokyo. Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Wednesday, “It’s important that Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi maintain a stable relationship.”

By Zakaria Wadghiri Rabat – In Morocco, new and amended laws become effective the moment they are publicly announced in the official gazette. The general secretariat of the government (SGG) publishes laws and legal notices in the Official Gazette, known in French as Le Bulletin Officiel. The national printing office provides a print edition, available only in Rabat at L’imprimerie Officielle, and the SGG an online version.   The Official Gazette is published in four editions: a general edition for laws, decrees, treaties, and other decisions in Arabic, sometimes translated into French; a weekly legal notices edition of judicial and administrative affairs in Arabic; a weekly record of the debates of the House of Representatives in Arabic; and a general semi-monthly edition with French translation. Subscribers can receive the paper version by mail, but it can take up to one month after the publication date to receive it.  Problems with the digital version The website gives direct and free access to all official gazettes since the first issue, whether in French or Arabic, and the site is regularly updated.  Moroccan lawyer Zineb Laraqui, who has worked extensively on these issues, explained to MWN that “not all the laws are translated into French, a regular language of business in Morocco. In addition, investors using English as a business language will find there is no official translation into English.”  Only the first, general edition for laws in Arabic and French (when it is translated) is online. Language barriers aside, the inability to search the online pdfs is a major hindrance to finding the right information on the gazette, according to the Marrakech-based lawyer and co-founder of online platform jurisprudence.ma.   Because the PDFs in the website are not plain-text documents but scanned versions of the printed publication, users have to look for information page by page.  Users sometimes find missing pages. On the international conventions page, the links for some pages return 404 errors. The error message indicates the web page has been removed but has not been redirected to a new address, becoming a “dead link.” Let’s make it searchable By comparison, Algeria’s SGG started annotating the PDFs of its recent gazette editions with text. The Tunisian official gazette website offers legal documents in a searchable format, using the PDF/A (accessible PDF) format. The official Saudi journal offers a dynamic view where users can search and retrieve information without leaving the page. The online version of the London Gazette,  one of the British government’s official journals, has a similar layout to the Tunisian website. It has scans of the print publication and a text layer added to each page. The layered pdf makes it possible to search and copy text from the document as it looks in the print version. The online Official Journal of the European Union has other features. The documents are not only multilingual and searchable but also clickable. Readers can click summary paragraphs to open the relevant detailed pages. The RSS service provided in the website allows registered users to follow documents and get notifications if they are changed. A potential negative impact for businesses  In the past few years, the SGG has made fewer French translations of laws, including most commercial and corporate legislation. According to Laraqui, “the lack of translated legal material could drive away potential investors.” Most countries investing in Morocco speak French or use English as a first or second language. France and the US are Morocco’s biggest investors by far, while only three of the top eight investing countries are Arabic-speaking. Laraqui explains that “when a new law amends or supplements an existing law, the website is not updated with the consolidated law, in contrast to Tunisia’s legislation website.” The legal notices issue is also not available online. The edition contains important legal notices on companies so that third parties can see information about bankruptcy, etc.  The electronic portal for the publication of legal announcements in the gazette is also accessible to advertisers who can upload their legal announcements. However, the portal is only available in Arabic. Next steps   According to Laraqui, “It might seem reasonable to have an official translation of all business and corporate laws, but a more urgent need for the business community is the actual availability of current laws.” To enable readers to search for keywords, such as their company’s name or register number, the contents of the gazette’s website need to be presented in plaintext. Using optical character recognition (OCR) would turn the scanned images of text into machine-readable text. Of course, OCR can contain errors depending on the clarity of the image and whether the letters can be easily distinguished. But OCR would be an improvement for the gazette.    The French Protectorate in the Cherifian Empire established by the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of Fez, published the first gazette in Morocco on November 1, 1912.  Meanwhile, between 1918 and 1956, the Tetouan-based General Secretariat of the High Commission of Spain in Morocco published an official journal for northern Morocco. After independence, King Mohammed V established the official gazette under the “Royaume du maroc” letterhead. While Morocco’s official gazette is a continuation of its historical gazettes, it can move into the future by becoming more accessible.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – France is still dealing with anti-government protests organized by a group known as the “Yellow Vests.” Protesting the rising price of fuel, nearly 300,000 people took to the streets on Saturday, many wearing yellow reflective vests.  The protesters set up roadblocks and quickly paralyzed French roads. Protesters also stationed around strategic positions like fuel depots. Police are now systematically working to dislodge protesters across the country, according to French sources Since Saturday, over 500 people have been injured, and two people died as a result of the traffic jams caused by the blockades. Businesses are also suffering since the protests broke out. Few people are able to find fuel stations that still have fuel in stock, leading to less people travelling to business centres. Freight shipments are also unable to get to businesses as well, leading to a double-headed issue for many stores in the country. Outcry grew after President Emmanuel Macron introduced a new hydrocarbon tax to promote alternative energy. The tax raised prices 23% in a year, to an average of €1.51/liter of diesel. The last time fuel prices were this high was the early 2000s, says AFP.  Drivers are not pleased with the taxes, and a French poll showed that over 70 percent of citizens support the Yellow Vests. Thursday morning, neighboring countries reported protests spilled over their borders.                    Global oil prices are steadily falling, since they peaked in October. However, the citizens of France are not feeling the benefits of this due to Macron’s taxes. Macron asked for dialogue, and his administration promised to invest €500 million to assist working-class households through energy subsidies and higher scrappage bonuses for the purchase of cleaner vehicles. Similar protests occurred in Morocco earlier this year. In October, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and freight drivers went on strike to protest against high fuel prices. Although the Moroccan protest was not as intense and violent as in France, Moroccans still felt its effect on commodity prices.  The cost of food, especially fruit and vegetable prices rose by nearly 33 percent after the strike.  Prices in Morocco are much lower now. In France, however, the situation remains tense, and protesters are planning large demonstrations in Paris this weekend.

By Halima Bensmail Doha – Every newspaper in the world was diligently writing their obituaries and preparations were already underway for a state funeral. There was a collective sigh in America as it was painfully obvious the country was going to lose one of its most beloved former presidents. Outside of a few oncologists, nobody knew about the breakthrough cancer drug Pembrolizumab, or, as it is now known, ‘the Jimmy Carter drug’. A combination of a fast diagnosis made possible by artificial intelligence (AI) and an entirely new approach to fighting cancer saved Carter’s life. A man expected to die three years ago has instead been actively weighing into the US’ recent 2018 mid-term elections, much to the delight of the Democrats and to the chagrin of the Republicans. Something dramatic is happening in the fight against cancer. A combination of diagnostic tools developed by bioinformatics scientists using AI, along with aggressive immunotherapy breakthroughs, has made cancer less of a death sentence and more of a word puzzle. Now, oncologists no longer speak of ‘remission’; they are beginning to hesitantly use the word ‘cure’. Dr. Halima Bensmail, a Moroccan AI scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), has been instrumental in developing a diagnostic tool for certain types of brain cancer that is also applicable to other cancers—including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer—to identify key driver genes. It can also potentially be used to identify key therapeutic targets in diseases prevalent in Qatar, such as diabetes and obesity. Together with other QCRI researchers and in collaboration with the University of Sannio in Italy, Columbia University Medical Center, and Henry Ford Health Systems, Bensmail built a machine-learning algorithm that can identify the main regulators of separate brain tumors. Knowledge of the purpose of these driver genes and the status of these cancer subtypes could further support the search for treatments or prognostic information in both glioma and other cancer types. The work reveals the identity and biological activities of the main genes that regulate and characterize the differences between different glioma subtypes.  Bensmail initially studied mathematics at the University of the Sciences in Rabat, and completed her Ph.D. at the University Pierre et Marie-Curie (ParisVI). Prior to joining QCRI, she taught Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at the University of Virginia Medical School and worked as a scientist at the Data Theory Center at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. She is convinced that the nascent field of bioinformatics, coupled with unconventional approaches to cancer treatment, will save millions of lives in the future. “With the growth of Big Data research and recent developments in sophisticated high-throughput data platforms, an emerging concept is to prevent or treat diseases that takes into account a patient’s variability in terms of genetic inheritance, lifestyle, and environment,” says Bensmail.  “There is an increasing awareness of the value of integrative medical data.” “Machine learning, a branch within the area of AI, is helping computers to learn from data and discover patterns without being explicitly programmed. For example, we developed a deep learning AI algorithm that could provide doctors with an automatic analysis of the brain structure while the patient is still in an MRI scanner. This would save the physician time, which he or she could use for more relevant tasks, such as patient treatment. Ongoing research, testing, and measurable improvements will be necessary to pave the way for the use of intelligent machines in hospital settings. These machines will not replace doctors but support them in their everyday work.” “Another example is using classification and prediction algorithms, to check the predisposition of a population—for instance, the Qatari population—to chronic disease such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease,” adds Bensmail. “In this situation, if we collect data in real time (cross-sectional data) and combine it with their historical data (cohort) as well as data from millions of similar patients, an intelligent system could predict a heart attack with a high rate of precision.” Discoveries of ways to harness the immune system to attack cancer have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. James Allison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and Tasuku Honjo of Kyoto University in Japan each discovered methods of removing the immune system’s ‘brakes’ that prevent it from attacking tumor cells. Following that path, a special branch of cancer immunotherapy aims at introducing T-cells, which have been specially engineered to recognize a tumor. However, in this case it is of utmost importance to ensure that the T-cell does indeed recognize the tumor and nothing else other than the tumor.  If introduced T-cells recognize healthy tissue, the outcome can be fatal. It is therefore extremely important to understand the molecular interaction between the sick cell, such as the peptide (which plays a crucial role in the monitoring of cells in our body by the human immune system) and the MHCI (which binds peptides), and the T-cell. One way to understand this mechanism is to build a classification model—a machine learning algorithm—and apply it to increase the understanding of the molecular interactions governing the activation of T-cells. Bensmail and her colleagues at QCRI have developed an algorithm that can be extended to understand the molecular interactions governing the activation of the T-cells using TCGA data (Cancer Genome Atlas database). They are applying it to predict which Master regulator is activated negatively or positively in response to the immunotherapy. They are currently testing this for breast cancer and hope to generalize it to 32 other cancer types that are part of TCGA database.

By Mohammed Tafraouti Beirut – The Arab Forum for Environment and Development (AFED) launched its annual report, Financing Sustainable Development in Arab Countries, at its 11th conference on November 8 in Beirut. The conference hosted 400 delegates from 40 countries representing governments, regional and international organizations, and the private sector. The World Bank, ESCWA, FAO, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Islamic Development Bank, and the Kuwait Fund attended.  The AFED report notes that the Arab region needs more than $230 billion a year to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The annual funding gap is estimated at more than $100 billion. The report also highlights the losses in economic activity due to the region’s wars and conflicts since 2011, which have amounted to about $900 billion. The price tag for achieving sustainable development will likely increase as regions will need to reserve money for reconstruction efforts in war-torn countries. The report points out the decline of public and private sources of funding in the Arab region. For every dollar entering through foreign direct investment inflows, about $1.8 is reinvested abroad, either through direct investment outflows or through the diversion of profits generated by foreign investors. At the same time, the region remains a lender to foreign banks based abroad, with deposits of Arab customers at major international banks consistently higher than loans given to Arab customers from these banks. The AFED report calls for reversing this investment into the Arab region, which needs to reform fiscal policies, combat corruption, and provide incentives and facilities to encourage investment and efficient use of resources. The opening ceremony was addressed by former Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, who stressed the need for fiscal reforms and enabling policies to open the way for a green economy in the Arab region. He highlighted the importance of investing in the water-energy-food nexus, and fighting climate change “which is a major challenge in the Arab region.” A former banker and minister of finance, he called upon the private financial sector to reform its operations and adopt innovative approaches to secure the funds needed for implementing sustainable development goals. He called this “an opportunity not an obstacle.” However, he stressed the need to put in place regulatory measures, public policies, and incentives to attract private investments in long-term projects. Taoufik Rajhi, Tunisia’s minister in charge of large-scale reforms, pointed out that his country’s new constitution emphasizes the right to a healthy environment. Implementing SDGs necessitated the development of the Financing Strategy for Sustainable Development in Tunisia through environmental funds, such as the Pollution Control Fund and the Energy Transfer Fund, public-private partnerships, and international financial cooperation. The conference was inaugurated with a welcome speech by Adnan Badran, chairman of AFED’s board of trustees and former Jordanian prime minister. He said that “Arab governments are required to efficiently manage human, financial and natural resources, eliminate corruption and establish public-private partnership to achieve sustainable development.” He also called for “the fostering of peace through active diplomacy to resolve conflicts in the region.” He especially focused on the importance of “diverting the heavy costs of arms procurement in the region towards financing the green economy and supporting sustainable development which would also open up new employment opportunities.” Najib Saab, AFED’s secretary general, presented the new report, explaining that “while the previous ten AFED reports identified the status of the Arab environment and proposed solutions, now is the time for implementation, and this requires finding adequate funding sources.” Saab outlined AFED’s achievements for the year 2018 and their impact on Arab environmental policies, especially in the areas of water and energy efficiency, by adjusting subsidy systems, diversifying the economy, introducing renewable energy on a large scale, and participating positively in international efforts to address climate change. He concluded by stressing the need to invest in people-centered development based on the respect for human dignity, accountability, transparency, and justice. The AFED Environmental Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Suleiman Al-Herbish, who ended his 15-year term as director general of the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) just days before the conference. “Suleiman Al-Herbish has been a global driving force in people-centered development. During his tenure, OFID advocated sustainable development and placed its principles at the heart of its work,” a statement from AFED said. It added that “one major contribution of Mr. Al-Herbish had been his tireless fight for energy poverty alleviation.” Al-Herbish said in a speech after receiving the award that he had always “recognized that access to modern energy services is a vital precondition to realizing these Sustainable Development Goals.” He explained that OFID’s campaign to eradicate energy poverty preceded the UN’s Energy for All initiative. “Our actions are based on a strategy with three pillars: Advocacy, expanding operations on the ground, and partnerships.” Representatives of various Arab and international development funds at the conference discussed ways of collaborating to mobilize additional resources to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. They stressed that not all investments needed new funds, but are largely dependent on the diversion of funding from traditional projects to sustainable ones, alongside increasing efficiency and fighting corruption. One session was devoted to financing sustainable energy, calling for the adoption of new instruments such as green bonds and Sharia-compliant sukuks (financial certificates), and stressing the importance of attracting private sector investment to renewable energy.  Business representatives spoke of the trade opportunities offered by the transition to sustainable development, provided that incentives, legislation, and appropriate laws are put in place. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also held a special session in which it presented a report on “Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth.” It highlighted the positive impact of controlling climate change on advancing sustainable development.

Rabat – Griffith’s previous efforts to end Yemen’s civil war fell through last September, when the Houthi rebels withdrew from talks claiming they were not guaranteed safe passage back to Yemen. On November 16, the envoy said both parties had given “firm assurances” that they are committed to attending peace talks in hope of reaching a workable framework by the end of the year.  Last week, the Saudi-led coalition ceased a five-month offensive to retake control of the Yemeni port-city of Hodeidah.r Over the weekend, however, fighting flared up again between the two sides. Yemen’s civil war is widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran who back the Houthi rebels. Saudi air forces launched at least ten air raids on Houthi strongholds late Monday. The airstrikes were met with artillery fire by Houthi forces. Later on Monday, the Houthi command announced that the group would stop conducting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and their Yemeni allies.   Hodeidah is one of the few ports leading into rebel-held territory and the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, “some 80 percent of commercial food imports and all UN-supervised humanitarian aid pass through its docks.”  As fighting renewed, the UN security council began circulating a new draft resolution. Spearheaded by the UK, the resolution calledfor a ceasefire t in Hodeida and all other critical ports of entry in Yemen, allowing much needed aid into the war-torn country.  Save the Children estimates that 70 percent of Yemen’s humanitarian aid and food goes through Hodeida. In the same report, the humanitarian group put forth a “conservative” estimate that 85,000 children under the age of five had died of disease and hunger since the outbreak of the civil war in 2015.  “Three-quarters of Yemen’s people require life-saving assistance and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the fighting.” The organization said the principal factor that lead to the famine was the Saudi-led blockade of Yemen, a blockade which was strengthened a year ago after Iranian-backed forces inside Yemen fired a missile at Riyadh.  The aftermath of the Saudi operation to murder Jamal Khashoggi has brought renewed attention to Yemen’s civil war, especially from Western nations who sell Saudi Arabia billions of dollars in arms sale annually. The US recently announced plans to stop refueling Saudi jets which frequently strike targets in Yemen.

Rabat – The Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics, will purchase several intelligent radars that would allow better traceability of traffic offenses other than speeding, daily newspaper Al Massae reported today. The interactive radars record the non-respect of the stop sign, the defect of a vehicle rear lights and the overtaking in a lane where it is not allowed.  Al Massae added that the ministry will also repair several out-of-service radars to allow a better road security. The introduction of these new intelligent radars will enable the police to have a complete view of nearly 20 kilometers and prevent  the “tricks” some drivers use. The ministry plans to place the new radars in high accident roads and in certain turns. Some of the radars can calculate the journey duration of each vehicle in the highways and enable the detection of speeding, the newspaper concluded. The ministry launched in April 2016 an application that allows traffic offenders to receive an sms of their infractions recorded by road radars. The application, “Infraction routieres,” also informs offenders of the type offense they committed, the method of payments, and the number of points corresponding the type of infraction. “Infractions routieres” is available for free in Google Play and Apple Store in Arabic and French. Since its launch, the application has been downloaded more than 500,000 times.

Rabat – The bid will be approved after technical and financial feasibility studies are completed in 2019. According to Reuters, Portuguese Secretary of State for Energy Joao Galamba said that the two countries are planning to call for tenders to build the 250 kilometers cable after the completion of the study in early 2019. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of  a conference on renewable in Skhirat, near Rabat, the Portuguese minister said that Portugal and Morocco are “strongly committed to this project.” The project is set to be operational before 2030. The two governments are planning to disburse a budget ranging from $686 million to $800 million, Reuters noted. Through the project, Rabat and Lisbon l plan to enhance cooperation on renewable energy development.  “The flow will go in both directions depending on our needs,” Galamba said. He added that after the launch of the project, “Portugal will export a little bit more than Morocco but after a few years it will be the opposite.” The electricity project between Portugal and Morocco is the second of its kind between a European country and the North African country after the launch of a subsea electricity project between Morocco and Spain since 1997. In May, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah said that Morocco is  committed to reinforcing relations with Spain to benefit from electricity supply to meet Morocco’s demands. According to Spanish electricity company Red Electrica De Espana, electricity exchange with neighbouring countries “provides greater security of supply, increased efficiency and competition between neighbouring systems.” The Spanish electric system is linked to the Portuguese system with North Africa, through Morocco, the company added. Export.gov reported in late 2017  that Morocco’s total primary energy consumption registered a  i 5 percent increase per year since 2004.  “Morocco produces 28,000 GWh of electricity and imports the rest from Spain.”

Yassin Meldi, a bus driver working for the M’dina bus company, took out his umbrella to hide from the rain that was leaking into the bus through the roof.  After the release of the video, the bus company fired the driver, accusing him of defamation. The conductor has meanwhile submitted a medical certificate indicating the deterioration of his health following the incident. Internet users have since taken to social media to express both anger and sarcasm.  “He is so unlucky to be living in a country where companies disregard their workers. Elsewhere he could have earned a medal for being selfless,” an internet user commented. “Actually, the LGV is all what we needed. Public transportation in our country is in a good situation,” another responded.    According to Le site info, the driver asserted his legal rights to sue the company for mistreatment.  “I used to work for MAD 1,200 per month. I hardly met my family’s needs or pay for water, electricity, and house bills,” he said.

Rabat- The four Gulf countries pledged to grant Morocco a total of  $5 billion between 2012 and 2016, $1.25 billion from each, to assist the North African country with its development projects.  According to recent data from Morocco’s treasury, Saudi Arabia and UAE’s grants amounted to $80 million between January and October 2018, compared with last year’s $480 million grant in the same period.  The two countries fulfilled only 10 percent of the expected sum, however. Qatar and Kuwait met their promises in August, while UAE’s grant reached $1.03 billion and Saudi Arabia only managed to disburse$868 million in the same month. The ministry’s report, the 2019 finance law, maintains that Morocco’s “inability to receive the full pledged sum is due to UAE and Saudi Arabia’s delay in fulfilling their commitment.” Although reasons for the delay are not clear, pan-Arab media outlet, The New Arab, reported that Morocco was not the only country at the receiving end of the delay. The newspaper noted that countries like Jordan and Bahrain have also not received promised aid package from the other Gulf countries, suggesting that the drop in oil prices created a financial crisis for the countries, which has hampered their ability to fulfill their commitments.

Rabat – The verdict of Slimani’s latest accolade came yesterday in the form of “the 50 most influential French personalities in the world in 2018,” an annual assessment by Vanity Fair of France’s darlings. The magazine spoke of this year’s “dream team” in the most obsequious terms, evidencing their standing in French society as the chosen few whose unique talents have won them special spots in the heart of the Republic. The names, unsurprisingly, come from art (mostly literature, cinema, and music), sports (football, in general), and—of course—politics. Rabat-born Leila Slimani came 2nd in this year’s ranking, behind stylist and photographer Hedi Slimane. Of Slimane, Vanity Fair wrote: “He evinces chosen [read calculated] speech and a precise vocabulary.” But that laudatory description of the stylist’ obsession with the mot juste also captures Leila Slimani’s minimalist literary style. While Slimani’s debut novel, Le jardin de l’ogre (soon to be translated in the US) experienced lukewarm reception in France’s literary circles, Slimani’s second, novel, Chanson Douce, catapulted her in the highest skies of France’s universe of literary criticism. Francophone readers are generally bombarded with traditionally pompous, bombastic, and self-important prose. Slimani’s minimalist and constrained prose, however, established her among the pioneers of an emerging Francophone (apparently America-imported) literary style that gives more importance to precision, plot, and emotional sincerity, rather than to eloquent formulations. As to why Slimani made it to the much-coveted second spot in Vanity Fair’s French “dream team,” the magazine wrote: “With all due respect to those who don’t find her first name Gregorian [read European] enough, our Goncourt winning author henceforth embodies a certain image of a French woman of letters: talented, open-minded, and committed.” Slimani’s global fame, the magazine went on, may have been uplifted after the New Yorker, a go-to magazine for literature connoisseurs, wrote “eight dithyrambic pages” about her works. But that’s not all. The Guardian, the British newspaper that claims millions of readers worldwide, ran “a big flattering portrait article” about Slimani. Slimani, Vanity Fair said quoting British literary critic Julie Myerson, is “brilliantly disturbing.” The suggestion points toward Slimani’s usually disturbing and subservice themes. But also perhaps her punchy and deliberately provoking prose. The novelist, whom Emmanuel Macron, appointed to lead his Francophony renaissance agenda, is actually in a situation where she travels the world and speaks at some of the most impressive forums worldwide, Vanity Fair suggested. Whatever the magazine’s reason for choosing Slimani, the bottom line remains that the novelist ranked second in a list of gifted and admired 50 personalities that included names like Kylian Mbape (3rd), the rising football sensation; and Emanuel Macron (5th), France’s 40-year old president. Despite recent scandals that somewhat tarnished his reputation, President Macron remains a star in progressive circles. His sustained admonishment of Donald Trump, Valdmir Putin, and Europe’s far-right politicians continue to drive many people to Macron’s patriotic and globalist outlook, the magazine said.

Rabat – The Tokyo District Court approved a request from the prosecutors on Wednesday to hold Carlos Ghosn and Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly  for an extra 10 days, Japanese Kyodo reported Wednesday. Japan arrested Ghosn for alleged on Monday for alleged financial misconduct by underreporting his salary by a total of $44 million over five years since 2011.  An internal investigation, based on a whistleblower report, found that “over many years, both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn‘s compensation.” Nissan also accused Ghosn of using company assets for his personal use. During the five-year period, Nissan’s chairman is suspected of not stating more than $886,000 worth of annual remuneration in the company’s annual securities reports from a Dutch-based subsidiary,” sources acquainted with the case told the Japanese Kyodo outlet Wednesday. Ghosn is allegedly suspected of underreporting the amount of his salary by billions of Japanese yen over the past three years, “although the company’s annual securities reports stated that the sum was about 2.9 billion yen.” Tokyo prosecutors claim the subsidiary has a serious role in the financial scandal. Ghosn is also suspected of using residences in Brazil, France, Lebanon, and the Netherlands. The Dutch subsidiary purchased the residence “without paying rent or reporting that benefit as part of his compensation.” The Japanese prosecutors consider Ghosn’s “alleged receipt of income from the subsidiary and bonus scheme, as well as the benefit, should have been reported as part of his remuneration,” according to Kyodo. A legal affairs executive operating under Kelly is believed to be involved in the purchases of the overseas residences, according to  the sources. Kelly is believed to have given instructions to the executive and other officials “to make false statements” in Nissan’s securities reports. If guilty, Ghosn and kelly could face a punishment of up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $88.5 thousand. Ghosn’s arrest caused a shock in the automotive industry, especially because Ghosn, who leads the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, is considered a highly influential executive within the global automotive industry. The alliance sold over 10 millions vehicles worldwide in 2017. On Tuesday, Nissan’s shares fell by 5.45 percent, while Mitsubishi’s were down 6.85 percent. On Monday, Renault shares tanked more than 8 percent in European trade. Before his arrest, Ghosn had been planning a merger between Nissan and Renault. However, Nissan’s executives opposed the deal, the Financial Times reported.  Ghosn’s objective behind the merger was to make “the partnership ‘irreversible.’” َ”A merger was likely to happen ‘within months,’” said a source close to Nissan board quoted in the British newspaper.

Rabat – “I was surprised by the development during my last trip to the Laayoune and Dakhla regions,” said Patricia Lalonde, a member of the EU parliament’s international trade committee. Lalonde made the comments on Tuesday, November 20, upon hosting in Brussels a delegation of five Moroccan parliamentarians. Mohamed Cheikh Biadillah, co-president of the EU-Morocco Friendship Group, led the Moroccan delegation to Brussels. Though the reason for the trip was not clearly articulated beforehand, it is believed to have been part of the EU’s assessment of Morocco’s repeated claims that the bulk of the benefits of EU-Morocco agreements involving southern territories go to the locals. While stressing the positive sides of Morocco’s development policies in the southern provinces, Lalonde also spoke warmly of the EU-Morocco agriculture deal. Of the agreement, she said she was “confident that it will be adopted” by all relevant EU bodies. She however suggested that full adoption and entry into force may take a bit longer, due to a number of required bureaucratic steps even after adoption. “While on the ground [in the southern provinces], I noticed the advantages and benefits of the [EU-Morocco] fisheries agreement,” she said. Lalonde’s suggestion backs up Morocco’s development investments in the southern provinces, especially Rabat’s repeated rebuttals of critics of its Western Sahara position. When voices inside the EU challenged the fisheries agreement, under the grounds that it did not benefit locals, both Morocco and an independent study showed that most of the financial benefits from the fisheries agreement go into development projects and job prospects improvement in the southern provinces. In her welcoming remarks about Rabat’s engagements in Laayoune and Dakhla, the European politician went as far as saying that Morocco’s development model in the region “should be emulated by governments in other places.” With such warm comments on Morocco’s investment in the southern regions, Lalonde has joined a long list foreign officials—particularly businessmen and diplomats—who have recently saluted Morocco’s development and investment efforts in the Laayoune region. Earlier this month, African diplomats who were visiting Laayoune said they were “impressed by the rapid transformations” in the region. “Every time we visit the region we witness considerable improvements,” said Ismaila Nimaga, ambassador of the Central African Republic to Rabat. But supportive statements have not come only from foreign nationals involved in politics. Warm comments about Morocco’s engagement in the South have also come from civil rights icons and investors.

Rabat – Morocco’s North Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) shared a statement today on its Facebook, saying that a source at a refugee camp in northern Syria told women living in the camp, including Moroccan women, that they might be handed over to Iraqi authorities in a period of no more than six months. The source added that the ISIS-linked women might be subject to the death penalty. The statement added that women and children are suffering from dire conditions, including nutrition issues. ONDH also recalled that it has been calling on the Moroccan government to return Moroccan women and their children back to Morocco and try to reintegrate them in Morocco based on the requirements of the international humanitarian law. Throughout his recent interviews with national and international news outlets, Head of Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame expressed concern over the threat imposed by ISIS returnees.  According to Khiame,  Morocco’s position regarding returning fighters was established in 2015, allowing police to apprehend them for investigation and place them in custody. Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. In July, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that Iraqi authorities wanted to extradite wives and children of Moroccans with ties to ISIS. In August, ONDH said that a Spanish-Moroccan security unit arrived in Syria to interview Moroccan women with alleged ties to ISIS to repatriate them. “The security intelligence team called the women individually and interrogated them beginning from the time they adopted the radical ideology to the moment they joined ISIS and fell in the hands of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria’s forces,” ONDH stated. ISIS Moroccan suspects are spread throughout the MENA region, but are mainly in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Khiame added that 1,666 Moroccans joined the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, of whom 929 joined ISIS. Nearly 225 other fighters have criminal records with terrorism-related charges. BCIJ’s chief added that 642 Moroccan fighters died in Syria and Iraq due to  suicidal terrorist operations.

Rabat – El Othmani appointed Salaheddine Mezouar to the board of directors of the National Social Security Fund CNSS following the proposal of the management. Mezouar, who is also the president of General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), will be a member of the CNSS board of directors, succeeding Meriem Bensaleh Cheqroun, the former president of CGEM, according to the Official Gazette published November 19. The appointment covers only the remaining three-year period of  board’s term, which began October 12, 2017.  El Othmani also appointed two representatives of the Ministry of Health to the  board of directors: Abdelouahab Belmadani and Aziz Tanjwi El Jazuli. Mezouar is also the former Minister of Industry, Trade, and Economy and  former Minister of the Economy and Finance. Mezouar also held the position of president of the Moroccan Association of Textile and Clothing Industries (AMITH) and president of the Textile and Leather Federation within the CGEM. Mezouar, a Moroccan politician and businessman, was born in 1953 in Meknes. Mezouar is the former president of the National Rally of Independents (RNI).

Rabat- On a joint mission on Monday, the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) and Oujda’s Prefectural Police Department arrested six individuals in connection with crimes of jewelry trafficking, including a mining company practising illegal mining and “trafficking historical objects.” The police seized 128 ancient silver coins, 17 plastic bags filled with lead and copper, equipments used for excavating and melting objects, and a sum of MAD 359,700 that the suspects were in possession of, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The suspects are currently undergoing police investigation. According to law 22.80 on the protection and preservation of Morocco’s cultural heritage, including historical buildings, antiques, and inscriptions, researchers who wish to explore must request authorization at least six months in advance. As for the excavation of archeological sites, Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication stressed in September that researchers must request government permission before excavating archeological sites. Some individuals illegally excavated private property or state property in search of treasure or other materials of significant value, and they even vandalized historical sites. In 2017, groups of “treasure hunters” vandalized Gantrat El Fellous and Dar Oum Sultan, two historical sites in the rural commune of Ait Sibern that lies between Rabat and Fez, according to national heritage management officials. Gantrat El Fellous is a historic bridge and an architectural monument built by the Almohad Dynasty in the 12th century.

Rabat – In a tweet, the British representative said that the UK “would like to see progress towards resolving long-standing issues between Maghreb states,” referring to the Western Sahara conflict. On November 6, King Mohammed VI offered Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue with Morocco to break the stalemate hindering Maghreb unity. He also said that Morocco is open to “any initiative or proposals” that would help to normalize the “much less than acceptable” relations between the two neighbors. The UK, according to Reilly, believes that the United Nations talks in Geneva scheduled for December  at the request of the personal envoy of the Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, is “important in this regard.” #UK Interested to see #Moroccan King’s proposal for mechanism for dialogue with #Algeria. UK would like to see progress towards resolving longstanding issues between #Maghreb states. #UN #WesternSahara talks in #Geneva next month important in this regard https://t.co/U97v846RR5 — Thomas Reilly (@TSAReilly) November 20, 2018  The UK was not the only country that backed King Mohammed VI’s proposal.  Earlier this month, the US Department of State said that rapprochement between Algeria and Morocco could help de-escalate regional tensions between Rabat and Algiers. “The US Government has urged Algeria and Morocco to recognize that improved relations will help the two countries tackle common bilateral and regional issues such as terrorism, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and economic integration,” the Department of State told the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Despite international leaders backing Morocco’s dialogue initiative, Algeria remains silent. Several Algerian parties responded to Morocco’s offer, especially when Moroccan parties announced that they would visit Algeria to meet with members of political parties. Algerian parties, including Ennahda, argued that steps to solve issues between the two countries should come from governments rather than political parties. Spain, Jordan, France, UAE, the United Nations, and the African Union all commended Morocco’s initiative.

Rabat – The Saudi nationals, according to the Saudi Sabq news outlet, the two nationals  are allegedly wanted for involvement in financial crimes. According to Sabq, one of the suspects fled to Morocco and refused to pay an SR 99.3 million fine (MAD 251 million) to a Saudi court. The second was allegedly involved in a case of fraud, signing fake agreements, and stealing an estimated SR 1.3 million (MAD 3.29 million). The two Saudi nationals have allegedly been transferred to the relevant services for further investigations, according to Sabq. The operation is allegedly in line within the framework of Interpol-the international police organization, added Sabq. In 2015, Morocco arrested Saudi prince Turki and extradited  him to Saudi Arabia. In October, Morocco’s Ministry of Justice asserted that it extradited Prince Turki based on an international Interpol arrest warrant in 2015. The Washington Post, however, reported that Interpol denied that it issued a “red notice” for the Saudi prince. Interpol does not issue arrest warrants.

Rabat – Sound Energy announced Monday the exploration results of the TE-9 well—the first of three planned wells to explore in the Tendrara area in eastern Morocco. The TE-9 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 2,925 meters and will now be plugged, abandoned, and not tested. The well encountered 60 meters of dolomitized silty sandstone, interpreted as an age equivalent to the primary target sandstone. The petrophysical analysis of the wireline data indicates the interval is of low porosity and therefore poor reservoir quality. The British oil company made its first natural gas discovery in the Tendrara area on June 6, 2016. The TE-6 well encountered approximately 28 meters of vertical net gas pay. It conducted many drilling operations in the same region, drilling the TE-7 well in October 13, 2016, which showed the same positive results as the previous well, and the TE-8 well in February 19, 2017, which also delivered positive results. Sound Energy has expanded its petroleum exploration duration by signing a new eight-year petroleum agreement with the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) in the Tendrara region.  The agreement will come into effect after the approval of the Moroccan finance and energy ministries. British giant SDX Energy is also conducting gas exploring operations in Morocco.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat- Oil Prices have fallen over the past five days from $68 per barrel to about $65.50 per barrel, according to data from InvestMine. After climaxing at about $81 per barrel in late September, oil prices have since dropped nearly $20 per barrel in less than two months. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, previously assured that production would increase after international calls to lower the global oil price increased. US President Donald Trump was extremely pleased with the recent oil price drop, and he immediately voiced his opinion on Twitter. Calling the oil price drop “a huge tax cut for America and the world,” he also asked the Saudis to “go lower.” Oil production in Saudi Arabia has increased to about 11 million barrels annually with more countries adjusting to American sanctions placed on Iranian oil, according to Bloomberg. In Morocco, both citizens and the government benefit from a drop in oil prices. Moroccan citizens already went on strike this year over high gas prices. The transportation industry was left paralyzed in October after taxi and bus drivers refused to work with the expensive fuel prices, according to Moroccan news outlets. Similarly, fruit and vegetables supplies increased in Casablanca by an estimated 33 percent in October when freight drivers also went on strike, prompting alarm in the government. The Moroccan government’s subsidies for butane gas cost about 2-4 percent of the annual GDP in 2014, according to the Economist. Cheaper oil would benefit industries across the country, and the government will also have more free capital to invest elsewhere. Prices will also be cheaper for everyday consumer goods, as freight costs will be lower across the country. Conversely, countries with a strong oil production industry continue to voice alarm over the price drop. Algeria, one of the biggest oil producers in Africa and an OPEC member, urged fellow OPEC countries to ignore Trump’s demand for lower oil prices earlier this year. The country relies on oil to maintain its foreign currency reserves, and experts estimate barrel prices must remain over $75 per barrel for the Algerian government to offset its budget deficit, according to Arab Weekly.

Rabat – Moroccan visa applicants will no longer be able to use the TLS Call Center during their visa application process.  Instead, applicants must create an account on the website France-Visas. They will then be redirected to complete an online visa application through the TLScontact form. The change is in part due to high call volumes and efforts to ease the application process. The final step in the process is to create a visa appointment through the online portal. Visa applications filed in Morocco can only be processed by French consulates in Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat, Fez, Oujda, Marrakech, and Agadir. According to the TLScontact website, visa applications filed before December 1, 2018, will follow the current procedure detailed on the site.  The changes are in accordance with the newly launched French national strategy, “Welcome to France,” which French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe launched Monday. La stratégie #BienvenueEnFrance, c’est :
➜ Augmenter le nombre d’étudiants étrangers accueillis dans nos écoles et nos universités.
➜ Faire financer les bourses des moins fortunés et des plus méritants en faisant payer les étudiants étrangers qui en ont les moyens. pic.twitter.com/slLlmdgZwo — Edouard Philippe (@EPhilippePM) November 19, 2018  The strategy aims to attract international students to study in French schools and universities. According to Prime Minister Philippe, the goal is to attract 500,000 students by 2027. France is a popular travel destination for Moroccans, according to Jevoyage.ma, due to “the advantage of accessibility, with frequent flights, in both regular and low-cost flights, which explain their success.” France is the fourth most common travel destination for Moroccans, with over 1 million North Africans visiting France annually.

Rabat- Three engravings on a rock surface illustrate two men watching what looks like an asteroid, emitting a trail of smoke, on its way to hit earth. The petroglyphs were found in Ida Oukazou village west of the High Atlas, in Essaouira province, reported MeteorNews on November 18. The Moroccan researchers behind the findings, Abderrahmane Ibhi, Fouad Khiri, Lahcen Ouknine, Abdelkhalek Lemjidi, and El Mahfoud Asmahri, compared the engravings to other petroglyphs discovered previously in the region.   The researchers also gathered testimonies from eyewitnesses of the fall of the Tissint meteorite in 2011, to reach the conclusion that the petroglyphs date back to ancient time, albeit not providing an idea on how old the engravings are. The Tissint meteorite was a Martian meteorite, a rock that formed on the planet Mars, and fell in Tata province in the Guelmim-Es Semara region on July 18, 2011. Tissint is the fifth Martian meteorite to be observed on its fall to earth. It is also the first to fall since 1962. The discovery is one of numerous Moroccan archeological findings. The Ministry of Culture and Communication announced early in November the discovery of ship ruins dating back to the 18th or 19th century off the Essaouira coast. The ministry announced on October 3 that scientists discovered a 90,000 year-old bone-knife made from an animal rib.  The bone tool, recovered in 2012 in the Dar es-Soltan 1 cave south of Rabat, is the oldest tool to have been shaped and used as a knife by the Aterian culture from the Middle Stone Age in North Africa. Other recently published scientific discoveries in Morocco came in March. An international team of researchers sequenced the DNA from Homo sapiens in Morocco dating to approximately 15,000 years ago in Grotte des Pigeons, in northeast Morocco near Oujda. The Homo sapiens, dating to the Late Stone Age, had a genetic heritage similar to both Near Eastern populations and sub-Saharan African populations. In June 2017, 300,000-year-old fossils of the oldest-known remains of Homo sapiens were also found in Morocco, suggesting that Homo sapiens evolved in various locations across Africa.

Rabat- Princess Lalla Hasna, King Mohammed VI’s younger sister, is the chairwoman of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection.  During the meeting on Tuesday, the princess received a briefing on Japan’s school pedagogy in the field of education for sustainable development (ESD) and discussed the possibilities of cooperation on technological tools for education, such as computer applications and games. The cooperation initiative is in line with the engineering program of Morocco’s education ministry, called “Generalization of Information and Communication Technologies in Education in Morocco.”  The meeting was also open for agreements on student and teacher exchange programs between the two countries.  Morocco’s Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research Said Amzazi; Morocco’s ambassador to Japan, Rachad Bouhlal; Japan’s secretary to the minister of education, Takashi Muaru; and the director general for international affairs, Mami Ouyama, attended the discussions. Japanese schools are members of UNESCO’s Associated Schools Project Network. The schools have integrated sustainable development into their curriculum. Japan has one of the best educated populations and the world’s top education and research centers, according to UNESCO. Since Japan’s formal recognition of Morocco in 1956, upon Morocco’s independence, the two countries have had a positive relationship, opening embassies in each other’s countries within the next 10 years.  Japan has often looked to Morocco as an important African partner both for trade and solving geopolitical issues in North Africa.  Japan has invested over MAD 28 billion in loans for Moroccan economic growth and business development since the end of 2015.  Japan was also a co-organizer alongside the UN, World Bank, and African Union Commission of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development in Tokyo in October. In late June both countries pledged to fight environmental problems in the Maghreb region by forming the “Morocco-Japan-Africa tripartite cooperation.”

Rabat – The president’s remarkable 633-word statement, issued Tuesday, defies reports by the CIA that emerged last week, which concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) was most likely culpable for the death of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.  Khashoggi was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Shortly after he entered, Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a 15-man Saudi hit squad who flew in Turkey from Riyadh the same day he was to visit the consulate. In connection with the slaying, Saudi prosecutors have indicted 11 defendants and are seeking the death penalty for five of them.  Trump’s statement begins with a single sentence proclaiming, “The world is a dangerous place!” He then opens with passages comparing Saudi Arabia and Iran’s relationships with the United States. Trump places the blame for Yemen’s catastrophic civil war squarely at Iran’s feet, stating, “Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave.” Reporters at the New York Times claim Trump dictated the blustering statement himself, a reflection of his “deeply held views” about Riyadh’s role in the administration’s foreign policy goals for the Middle East. He went on to praise the Saudis pledge to invest billions of dollars to counter “radical Islamic terrorism,” a phrase used frequently by Trump.  Beyond a strategic alliance, Trump praised the Saudis promised investments in US weapons and the American economy at large. He specifically cited $110 billion of arms sales to manufacturers such as Raytheon and Boeing, a number which analysts contacted by the Times disputed. “Economists and military analysts said those numbers were so exaggerated as to be fanciful.” Since Trump has taken office, the Saudis have not concluded a single arms deal with the US. The president left open the possibility that MBS may have had direct knowledge of the plan to kill Khashoggi before it happened. “It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event – maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!” Trump wrote. He added, “We may never know.”  He then went on to state Riyadh’s importance to the US superseded the death of Khashoggi, who was a permanent US resident. “In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.” The statement blindsided lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Washington D.C., and was condemned widely by human rights organizations. Even Trump’s close allies expressed disagreement.  “The behavior of the crown prince — in multiple ways — has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent golf partner of the president.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a bipartisan letter to Trump demanding his administration determine conclusively MBS’s role in the death of Khashoggi.  With outrage being expressed in equal measure by both Republicans and Democrats, there is a possibility that Congress may pass further sanctions on Saudi Arabia, with enough votes that the president may not be able to veto. Last week the administration announced financial and travel restrictions on those originally arrested by Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – Convening more than 5,000 participants, the 2018 Africities summit November 20-24 in Marrakech aspires to tackle urgent questions related to “sustainable citizenship” and “responsible urbanization” in a rapidly changing Africa. As this year’s Africities event celebrated 20 years of addressing “Africa’s pressing human and environmental issues,” participants—politicians, academics, journalists, civil society, and elected local officials—discussed common challenges for sustainable development and responsible citizenship in a context of surging global constraints. Under this year’s theme, “Transition to Sustainable Cities and Territories: The Role of African Territorial Collectivities,” discussions centered on the role of municipalities and local governments in devising mechanisms to foster innovation, inclusive growth, and creative ways of “experiencing our cities.” Inter-African solidarity and cooperation Despite the wide range of perspectives from which participants at the summit’s opening ceremony looked at the issue at hand, they agreed on the need to “find creative ways of harnessing the complexities of urbanization in Africa.” Speaking at the opening ceremony on Tuesday, November 20, Abdelouafi Laftit, Morocco’s interior minister, stressed “Morocco’s readiness to share its experience in urbanization and city planning with its African brothers.” According to Laftit, Rabat’s experience in decentralization policies and urban planning could be the basis of a concerted African platform to tackle urbanization-related challenges. That this year marks the second time in a row that Marrakech hosts the Africities event “indicates the particular interest that Morocco attaches to African solidarity and cooperation.” Placing the Marrakech summit in a context of “necessary cooperation between municipalities and other stakeholders,” the Moroccan official remarked that Africa’s numerous challenges (youth unemployment, immigration, ecological constraints) require inter-governmental cooperation to satisfy basic development necessities. The goal of such a collaborative development agenda, he elaborated, is to “provide citizens with proximity services” and “consolidate human development.” Urban maturity and reflection While echoing Laftit’s insistence on a pan-African platform of experience sharing and collaborative development projects, other participants drew attention to the task of reflecting on the future of African cities. Thrust into an unrelenting process of globalization and urbanization, Africa should focus on blending the local and the global. While it is necessary to jump on the global bandwagon of sustainable urbanization, they argued, the focus should be on investigating the advantages and disadvantages of rapid urbanization. How, they asked, can Africa’s decision makers and stakeholders coordinate efforts to plan a future of sustainability and inclusiveness for African cities? Answers that participants provided were strikingly different, evidencing their multiple backgrounds. The common denominator, however, was an unceasing insistence on “thinking the future of African cities” by proposing up-to-date, context-specific, and efficient policies. “The Marrakech summit is one of [African] maturity,” said Soham El Wardini, president of United Local Governments of Africa (CGLU), one of the organizing bodies. “Transition to sustainable development has become an existential requirement,” she said. But it is important that the dynamics and actions spurring that transition be local. Africities, she explained, “is a useful and open platform for reflecting and deliberating on simple but crucial questions. Jean-Pierre Elong Mbassi, CGLU’s secretary general, agreed. For Mbassi, “local Africa [homegrown solutions] embodies the future that we all want for Africa: development and prosperity.” Echoing the event’s themes, he also underlined that fulfilling sustainable citizenship demands inter-African cooperation. Making African cities livable and sustainable demands actions aimed at understanding and integrating regional disparities and similarities in terms of urban development, he argued. How do Africans interact with the places they inhabit? What are the policies needed to maintain socio-economic peace in cities of striking socio-economic diversity? How can Africa’s growing urbanization take advantage of the continent’s technology-savvy youth? While conceding that one summit cannot answer all the questions about the complexities of urbanization, the first day of the Marrakech summit left participants and attendees with optimistic notes on the future of African cities. Mbassi, CGLU’s secretary general, noted, “The Africities summit gives us the opportunity to invent our future and invite the world to build a sustainable future for us all.”

Rabat- El Khalfi said the government has allocated MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund in the 2019 Finance Bill. Moroccan citizens, he said, should know today that the government provides them with an “excellent service” every time they buy a bottle of gas or flour and sugar, reported Moroccan outlet Machahid 24. Expenses from the subsidy fund is expected to reach MAD 17.65 billion by the end of 2018, while the government was expecting to spend just under MAD 13 billion in the 2018 Finance Bill. As the subsidy fund’s mission is coming to an end, the El Othmani government announced Thursday that it will present to Parliament a bill to target the poor who are eligible for support after the price liberalization of flour, sugar, and butane gas, so far subsidised, scheduled for the end of 2019, according to Moroccan outlet Le 360. In 2016, the previous government, led by Abdelilah Benkirane, introduced a reform of the subsidy fund to remove subsidies.

Rabat –  The vote reflects the positive position of political groups that represent the commission at the EU Parliament concerning the partnership between EU and Morocco, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Other EU commissions will discuss the EU-Morocco agricultural deal, including the commission of foreign trade and fisheries (INTA) before the final vote on the agreement. Prior to AFET’s vote, the EU Parliament committee on Agriculture and Rural Development announced that it is in favor of renewing the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement earlier this month. The committee’s views may reflect the “position of the political groups represented therein in favor of the adoption by the European Parliament of this agreement which aims at extending trade preferences to agricultural and fishing products from Morocco’s southern provinces.”   Morocco and the EU also agreed on renewing their fisheries deal, which expired on July 14. The fisheries deal must pass through the EU Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states before entering into effect. Several members supported the renewal of partnership between Morocco and the EU, including Spain. On November 13, Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas called for a “rapid ratification” of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement at the European Parliament. The official asked them to speed up the ratification so that it can be approved in the first quarter of 2019 to allow Spanish fishermen to fish in Moroccan waters.  He told the press that he received positive reactions from the MPs.

Rabat – Following Japan’s arrest of Ghosn on Monday, Renault’s board of directors held an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the matter. Renault said that the 64-year-old Ghosn would remain the company’s chairman and CEO. The board of directors decided to appoint the company’s chief operating officer, Thierry Bollore, as a temporary deputy CEO who will have the same powers as Ghosn. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said that Ghosn was “no longer in a position” to lead Renault, in which the French government has a 15 percent stake, BBC reported. Le Maire added that Renault’s partnership with Nissan was in the interests of France and Japan and of both companies. Renault holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan. The Japanese carmaker owns a 15 percent stake in Renault and 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors.  Japan arrested Ghosn for alleged financial misconduct of underreporting his salary by $44million over five years since 2011. The misconduct also included “personal use of company assets.” An internal Nissan investigation, based on a whistleblower report, found that “over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn’s compensation.” Regarding Nissan’s accusation of Ghosn, “the Board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr. Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities,” reads a Tuesday Renault statement. Renault said it will request Nissan “to provide all information in their possession arising from the internal investigations related to Mr. Ghosn.” Ghosn’s arrest caused a shock in the automotive industry, especially because Ghosn, who leads the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, is considered a highly influential executive within the global automotive industry. The alliance sold over 10 millions vehicles worldwide in 2017. On Tuesday, Nissan’s shares fell by 5.45 percent, while Mitsubishi were down 6.85 percent. On Monday, Renault shares tanked more than 8 percent in European trade. Nissan and Mitsubishi are preparing to dismiss Ghosn from his positions. On Monday, Nissan said that its CEO Hiroto Saikawa would propose immediately ousting Ghosn from his position. On Tuesday, Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said the alliance would be hard to manage without Ghosn, Reuters reported. “I don’t think there is anyone else on Earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,” Masuko told the press in Tokyo. Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday, “It’s important that Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi maintain a stable relationship,” the Japanese Kyodo outlet reported.

By Shaquile Goff Essaouira’s vice mayor made history by leading the city to become the first and only non-European member of the pact. The alliance consists of the Spanish cities of Cordoba, Seville, and Granada, in addition to Nuremberg, Germany.  The mission of the agreement is to combat religious tensions and promote peaceful values, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The cities’ representatives gathered to officially sign the document in a meeting in Medina Azahara, near Cordoba, Spain. Andre Azoulay, president of the Foundation of the Three Cultures of the Mediterranean, said he was proud to see the city of Essaouira join the accord and praised the new foundation the agreement is laying in intercultural communication and cultural exchange, according to MAP. The purpose of the agreement is to fight discriminations based on race, Islamophobia, and anti-semitism, while also promoting peace and open dialogue. Cordoba’s mayor Isabella Ambrosio spoke highly of the agreement, saying, “The signatory cities are a world reference in the coexistence of the three monotheistic religions.” She added that the cities hoped to promote this peace and open dialogue in cities across the world.  The vice president of Essaouira’s city council, Tarik Ottmani, represented the city in Medina Azahara and participated in the signing ceremony alongside the mayors of all the other cities.  Azoulay also spoke highly of the leadership of King Mohammed VI as a reason for Morocco’s ability to be a part of this inclusive agreement.

Rabat – The secretary of state at the ministry of National Education, Higher Education, and Scientific Research, Khalid Samadi, revealed the figures while speaking before the House of Representatives on Monday. Samadi has highlighted the joint vision that both Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) and the ministry put in place in 2003, which allowed the continuous training of 15,000 teachers of Tamazight. The partnership wrote and produced textbooks for grades 1-6 in primary school and wrote Tamazight dictionaries with the help of IRCAM.  Samadi pointed out that the institute and the ministry will provide enough Amazigh (Berber) professors to compensate the lack in the field, estimating the need for Tamazight teachers in primary schools at 8,000 teachers by 2029-2030. The statistics echoed Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s figures revealed in a meeting at the House of Councillors on June 19 while responding to a question about “the public policy concerning the development of national languages and cultural expressions.” El Othmani considered that teaching Tamazight in primary schools is mandatory. He added that 4,200 primary schools in Morocco teach Tamazight, while more than 500,000 students study the language.  He also insisted on integrating Tamazight into the educational system, as part of Morocco’s “rich national identity.” Moreover, El Othmani has urged the usage of Arabic and Tamazight—the two languages of Morocco stipulated in the 2011 Constitution—in public institutions and administrations and in books, media outlets, TV channels, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. The July 2011 Constitution was the first time Morocco considered Tamazight an official language in the country.

Rabat – The attack occurred at a wedding hall in Kabul, where hundreds of Afghan religious scholars had gathered to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad.  Wahid Majroh, Afghanistan’s health ministry spokesperson, confirmed at least 55 were killed with 94 others injured, adding he expected the death toll to climb as many victims were in critical condition. It is unclear who is responsible for the bombing, although the Taliban released a message on Whatsapp condemning the attack. According to the Associated Press, the bombing bore the traits of an ISIS-affiliate-sponsored operation. Both the Taliban and the ISIS groups have targeted Kabul with a renewed frequency in recent months, but as AP explained, “they are bitterly divided over leadership, ideology and tactics. The Taliban mainly target security forces and government officials, while IS specializes in sectarian attacks on civilians.” Afghan President Ashraf Ghani declared Wednesday, November 21, a day of national mourning for the country, according to his spokesperson who posted a statement on Twitter. Pres. @ashrafghani condemns the terrorist attack on a gathering commemorating birthday of Prophet Mohammad SAW in Kabul. He sent his thoughts and condolences to the bereaved families of victims while instructing the authorities to use every possible mean for cure to the wounded. — Haroon Chakhansuri (@hchakhansuri) 20 novembre 2018  In June of this year, a similar attack targeted Muslim scholars as they gathered in front of Kabul’s Polytechnic University, killing seven people.

Rabat – Following routine searches on the weekend, customs aborted an attempt to carry €107,050 in undeclared cash into Morocco. The suspect, a Moroccan national living in Spain, concealed the cash in his luggage to avoid filing a report of international transportation of currency, Tanger-Med customs reported Tuesday. According to the port’s customs, a similar operation arrested another Moroccan national residing in Italy who attempted to smuggle approximately €17,600 in undeclared cash aboard a car with Italian plates. Customs also seized, in two separate operations this weekend, €18,200 and €45,200 in cash transported by two Moroccan nationals returning from Italy. Earlier this month, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) thwarted an attempt to smuggle large quantities of ecstasy pills into Morocco. In April, authorities arrested a truck driver in Tangier-Med while trying to transport 53 kilograms of cannabis to Spain. An x-ray gave away the drugs concealed between the truck frame and the engine cooling system.

Rabat – After a seven-year relationship, the woman acted when she discovered her boyfriend’s plan to marry another woman, the National newspaper reported. According to police in Al Ain, a city east of Abu Dhabi, the woman committed the crime months ago. The crime only surfaced on November 13 after the victim’s brother reported his brother missing following a visit to the couple’s house where he found a tooth in a blender. The woman reportedly murdered, cut, and minced the victim’s flesh before she served it to nearby Pakistani workers in Mashboos, a national rice and meat specialty dish. DNA analysis confirmed the match and the suspect confessed to the crime, saying she did it in a moment of “insanity.” A friend of the woman denied complicity in the crime, but confirmed remarking blood stains in the house after the incident.
Police have said that after investigation the court will pursue charges against the woman.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The British ambassador to Morocco accepted the invitation of the ECNG to visit their university, making a stop at their campus in Kenitra last Thursday, November 15.  Reilly spoke to the students about the importance of commerce and bilateral relations, according to his official Twitter account.  The ambassador also said he was impressed by the superb quality of the discussion with the students.  ENCG Director Sadok Khazrouni also spoke alongside the ambassador during the meeting. The director reflected on the importance of the long diplomatic relationship that Morocco and the UK have. He also discussed the importance of international trade as a key factor of job creation and economic success. Reilly also discussed political events such as Brexit. The ambassador believed that the exit of the UK from the EU actually has a chance of  strengthening trade relations between the UK and Morocco. Reilly also shared he had intentions of further solidifying Moroccan-UK relations through increasing citizen exchange programs.  As for the students, Reilly only had extremely positive things to say. The ambassador said “I found that they were well informed about the history, culture and economic relations between our two countries. They asked me relevant questions, while being attentive, respectful and interactive.”  When discussing the educational links between the countries, Reilly said there was a need for Moroccan and British universities to maintain close links.  As investments in African countries are seeing an increase by wealthier nations, Britain is seeking to secure itself a seat at the table.  Countries like China have already made diplomatic inroads in trade with Morocco, and as industries like tourism grow in the country, the UK is beginning to catch on, looking at the North African nation with more interest.

Rabat – Titled “Breaking Algeria’s Political Paralysis,” the November 19 report offers a grim reading of Algeria’s current politico-economic system. The report found that the uncertain and chaotic price fluctuations that characterized the global oil market in 2014-2017 have dealt a serious blow to Algeria’s relatively successful post-1990s rentier state model, renting its resources out to foreign clients. And despite the fact the global oil market has somewhat recovered from the chaotic 2014-2017 years, the overall perception for Algerians and Algeria observers is that the country is in dire need of bold and “courageous reforms.” “The state can no longer afford to postpone” reforms, the study warned, pointing to the pressing need to “break Algeria’s [ongoing] economic paralysis.” It insisted that profound social and political crises loom on the horizons if authorities in Algiers maintain the current trend. “Despite an increase in revenues in 2018 due to a recovery in oil prices (which might not last), a potential economic crisis could come as soon as 2019,” the study asserted. Algeria’s current unsustainable socio-economic model includes political complacency, lavish state spending, exclusion of youth from decision-making, the political elite’s sense of entitlement, and over-dependence on oil revenues, according to the report. The Bouteflika factor In 1999, current president Abdelaziz Bouteflika ascended to the country’s premier political office following a violent and bloody civil war that paralyzed Algeria in the 1990s. Bouteflika’s rentier system—using oil revenues to buy voters and elite’s loyalty—maintained a sense of economic and social stability. Starting in 2011, the Arab Spring’s mass popular uprisings in the MENA region destabilized and overthrew many regimes. Bouteflika’s regime, however, armed with lavish oil revenues, succeeded in averting turmoil. Algiers bid on state generosity and rent distribution to curb any prospects of popular uprisings. The result, according to ICG, was a semblance of social peace and a sketchy and unsustainable economic model maintained at the expense of the bold reforms needed. However, current developments in the region and international politics have made Algiers’ rentier regime unsustainable and doomed to fail sooner rather than later if urgent steps are not taken to reverse the political elite’s complacency. While President Bouteflika rose to political prominence after Algeria’s lost 1990s decades as the engineer of the social peace and oil-driven economic prosperity, the 81-year-old’s insistence on running for a fifth term in 2019 has become a source of deep uncertainty. Crises and social unrests are a possibility if the current political class ignores surging demands for change and reforms. “Bouteflika’s administration, having leveraged Algerians’ past traumas into its own overextension, is unable or unwilling to confront succession” despite the fact that “prominent Algerians have repeatedly and publicly questioned whether Bouteflika is governing the country in reality.” President Bouteflika’s severely declining health since his 2013 stroke, coupled with his extremely rare public appearances, have led many to argue that he is not in a situation to govern Algeria. State power in Algiers now lies in the president’s restricted circle of army officers and a handful of technocrats, and not the president himself. While President Bouteflika glued Algerian society together in the wake of the 1990s crises and restored national confidence and pride, the now “aging and ailing” president’s unwillingness “to pass the torch to a new generation” has become “a factor that contributes to a general sense of paralysis.” Urgent reforms But, given the pervading sense of paralysis and chaos lurking beneath Algiers’ apparent socio-economic stability, what is to be done? What should Algeria’s leadership do to avoid the grim picture that ICG’s report has painted? The first move would be to diversity the country’s economy, ICG argued. As with other rentier states where the status quo thrives on political paternalism and the disruption of the traditional “no taxation without representation” narrative, Algeria “should seek to renegotiate an implicit social contract between the state and its citizens.” Also crucial in the reform agenda is curtailing corruption, “wasteful spending,” and “highly opaque” decision-making. The success of such reforms passes through “intra-governmental communication and cooperation” as well as the inclusion of the voices and needs of those who have been traditionally left out, particularly the youth and entrepreneurs. “Given the public perception that a small elite has captured the state,” what Algeria now needs is to uphold political accountability and transparency. A further step is to devise a new economic model that embraces a diversity of economic, political, and societal actors in building a new system that can ensure both stability and growth. Failure to do so, ICG warned, will precipitate Algeria into another decade of deep successive crises, not later than 2019.

By Shaquile Goff The government of the western Chinese province of Xinjiang has issued a statement saying “All individuals involved in terrorist crimes and poisoned by the ‘three evil forces’ are urged to surrender themselves to the judicial organs within 30 days and to confess and hand over the facts of your crime,” according to Al Jazeera.  The government has promised leniency to Muslims that voluntarily comply and turn themselves in. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has begun a nationwide persecution of the country’s Muslim population, especially targeting the Uighur ethnicity that mostly live in Xinjiang province. In a report that the UN submitted, over a million Uighurs are currently detained in what the government calls “re-education camps.” The Chinese government has defended the use of camps in state-run media interviews by stating that the prisoners are also able to take occupational classes on topics such as hairdressing or commerce. However, the Xinjiang government also issued bans on certain Islamic clothing, long beards, and some religious names. The government calls it an attempt to de-extremify the province, for fear of the spread of Islamist and separatist groups in the province. The increased repression of religion in China is receiving condemnation from the international community.  In 2018, a report from the Humans Rights Watch stated, “The government restricts religious practice to five officially recognized religions in officially approved religious premises, and the Chinese government retain control over religious bodies’ personnel appointments, publications, finances, and seminary applications.”  China is also allegedly trying to control the Uighur population abroad, mostly with threats to family and informants in Uighur populations throughout Western Europe, according to the Independent. The government appears to be breaking up the Uighurs by placing mistrust into the community.

Rabat – The much-anticipated satellite split from its airspace Vega rocket at 2:42 a.m. Moroccan time. According to NASA Spaceflight, the final countdown before the satellite left the ground began nine hours and ten minutes before Vega’s scheduled liftoff. NASA Spaceflight also gave details about the launch, saying that the “rocket’s key systems were powered up, with the multi-functional unit (MFU) that controls Vega’s electronics, turned on at the T-6-hour mark in the count.” The final two steps before the satellite was launched came about 145 minutes and 75 minutes before liftoff, “with the rocket reaching launch readiness at the fifty-minute mark in the countdown.” Like Morocco’s first satellite, the second satellite was named after King Mohammed VI. Beginning orbit in 2017, the Mohammed VI-A satellite was also launched by the Vega Rocket. Mohammed VI-B is the French Arianespace company’s ninth air projects this year. Through the launch, Vega reached a record of 13 successful launches, according to Space News. Thales Alenia Space produced the satellite as the system’s prime contractor and Airbus as c-prime, according to NASA spaceflight. The Mohammed VI-B satellite is capable of taking double the number of images that Mohammed VI-A can take with a resolution of up to 70 centimeters. The satellites’ uses Both Morocco’s satellites will work together to ensure strong surveillance for the country’s border and coasts and to manage natural disasters. Weighing 1,110 kilograms, the satellite will also be used for mapping and agricultural monitoring. The satellite will be piloted from Morocco and will fly at the same orbit as the first satellite, 620 kilometers above the earth. On November 13, Arianespace said that the satellite will be complementary to Mohammed VI-A and will “jointly enable a faster coverage of zones of interests.”  The satellite information will also help Morocco to have a better observation of the territory, in terms of forest fire control and anticipation.  The North African country can anticipate climate variations such as drought or floods. It will also help in case of natural disasters such as earthquakes or fires by showing a cartography of affected areas. The government plans for the satellites to help security agencies track any terrorists or drug trafficking across borders, especially in the Sahel regions. Each satellite has a role to provide military services information to ensure national security. The government acknowledged throughout the year that the first satellite helped the country to track illegal activities of the Polisario Front.  Morocco is the third African country to have a reconnaissance satellite after Egypt and South Africa.

Although the match at Tunisia’s Stade Olympique de Rades was a friendly, it counted a lot in terms of team morale and quality assessment, especially as the two African giants are preparing for sterner challenges on the continental stage.  Emerging from a draining week of CAN qualifiers, both teams are in the process of putting in place competitive squads to represent them at Africa’s foremost football tournament in June 2019 in Cameroon.  On a chilly night of intermittently tantalizing football between the two North African country, Morocco’s Youssef En-Nesyri scored the evening’s only goal at the 41st minute of the game. There was energy and desire in the remaining minutes of the game. There was depth, though occasionally. Most of all, perhaps, there was, from both teams, a constant need to make a strong statement of quality, even superiority. While Morocco wanted to break the curse of Rades (where they had never won before), Tunisia, ranked above Morocco in FIFA rankings, had no desire to relinquish its on-paper superiority.  There may have been no qualifying spot at stake, no trophy to win. But what was at stake looked great enough, big enough, worth fighting for: pride.  Morocco’s Atlas Lions played to break from the psychological weight of never winning at Rades, an aspiration which Tunisia’s Eagles were determined to smash.  Medhi Benatia and Romain Saiss showed a solid rock-solid defence and kept Tunisia at bay. A few minutes before the break, it was the captain, Benatia, who fired a shot from far away after Abdelilah Hafidi was fouled in the middle of half of the opponents’ area. Youssef En-Nesyri, aware of the rebound, scored his sixth international goal. Morocco, deploying a cautious 4-4-2 tactical disposition in the second half, foiled the Tunisian team’s regained energy. And despite repeated pressure from Tunisia’s Eagles, Morocco’s Lions seemed comfortable in their 1-0 lead.  Tunisia’s striker Wahbi Khazri and defender Nordin Amrabat of Morocco received one yellow card each.  Renard’s men struggled to find their feet at the start of the game and Tunisia did well to push them high up on the pitch. And so, Morocco, who had also won its latest game, a much urgent qualifier game against Cameroon, succeeded in maintaining its invincibility against Tunisia.  If anything, the past few days have been enormously rapturous for Atlas Lions and their fans. After breaking the curse of never beating Cameroon, they’ve just broken that of never beating Tunisia in Rades. Perhaps, after all, that’s what Renard-coached teams do: they reduce the domains of implausibility. For all the criticism that Renard and his boys have received after their early World Cup exit and the immediate lacklustre displays that followed, Morocco’s team seems to have found its way back to a beautiful and confident football.

Rabat – The Moroccan pop singer will now be tried for crimes of sexual assault and willful violence against Prioul, a French national.  According to MEDIAPART news website, in order for Saad Lamjarred to be found innocent, the judge would have had to issue a nonsuit order, which wasn’t the case. On the contrary, the judge has corrected the rape and referred the criminal case to the correctional court. The rape, however, will be tried as an offense rather than a crime. The same source added that the procedure of requalifying rape is very common in France, estimating that 50 to 80 percent of rape cases in France have been requalified, and explaining that Lamjarred would be sentenced to 5 to 7 years in prison if found guilty. On October 26, 2016, Lamjarred was charged with raping Laura Prioul. French authorities detained him for six months at the Marriott Champs Elysees in Paris pending his trial. Later, on April 13, 2017, he was released on bail under electronic surveillance.

Rabat- Gabon’s top court ordered Moussavou to run the country’s affairs in place of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who is reportedly being hospitalized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, after suffering a stroke during a conference on October 24. In light of Bongo’s long absence, the Constitutional  Court has resolved to authorise Moussavou to chair the Council of Ministers and handle urgent matters that have remained on hold for weeks. The court stated that the decision is “to ensure the continuity of the State and the public service, as well as the regular functioning of the government,” as reported Africanews. While the Gabonese court’s decision can settle many of the country’s pressing issues, citizens and members of Bango’s family cannot help but inquire about Bango’s real whereabouts. The lack of explanation and details about Bango’s extended absence and hospitalization in Saudi Arabia have piqued international interest. The media has even speculated that Bango may have died in the aforementioned Saudi hospital.

Facebook has also been experiencing trouble with newsfeeds and posting. Down Detector has registered hundreds of reports that Instagram is down, with the issues peaking at 1,300 reports. Out of those reported issues, some 66 percent of Instagram users were having issues with the newsfeed. When trying to access the website, users got a “5XX Server Error,” and the app displays the message, “Could not refresh feed.” Users have flooded social media sites, including Twitter, to share their dismay. One Instagram fan tweeted: “#instagram is down every one panic this is the end of the world run for you’re lives.” Some users say they have tried to delete the app and reinstall it, which caused even bigger issues. Posting a message on the Down Detector forum, one Instagram user said: “Can’t refresh the app this morning. Tried deleting and then download the app. Now can’t log at all.” Another confirmed: “Wouldn’t refresh the feed, upload a photo or let me comment. Deleted and reinstalled app, now saying there’s a problem their end and it won’t let me log on.”

Rabat – In an interview with Spanish news outlet EFE, the Portuguese official said that he has not received any official proposal from Spain regarding the trio bid. During his visit to Morocco this week, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez proposed a trio bid with Morocco, Spain, and Portugal for the 2030 World Cup. Sanchez said that King Mohammed VI and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani were receptive to the idea. Costa said that the proposal is “an uncertain idea that has never been officially put to us, and when it is we naturally have to study it.” He added that a trio World Cup bid would be beneficial but also “expensive.” The Portuguese official said that if Portugal receives the proposal, the Portuguese Football Federation will evaluate it within the framework of FIFA. He noted that the proposal also needs to be discussed between political parties in his country. Costa acknowledged that ties between Portugal, Spain, and Morocco have “huge strategic importance” and “great potential” to boost dialogue between Europe and Africa, “one of the great challenges of this century.” In his press conference in Rabat yesterday, Sanchez said: “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it.” In September, Portuguese sports news outlet A Bola reported that hosting a World Cup in 2030 is not part of Portugal’s agenda. It remains to be seen whether Portugal and Morocco will join Spain for a joint bid to compete for the rights to host the massive tournament in 2030. Morocco competed to host the 2026 World Cup but lost to the North American trio bid in June.

Rabat- Delegations from the two countries met at the 11th African Union summit on reforms in Addis Ababa. Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s head of government who led the Moroccan delegation at the summit, met with Mbagnick Ndiaye, Senegal’s minister of African integration. Discussions between the two delegations centered on finding ways to commit more African countries to the 3S initiative, a 2016-launched platform which Senegal and Morocco pioneered from the outset. Standing for “Sustainability, Stability, and Security” in Africa, 3S aims to help the AU achieve its most urgent goals, especially food security and irregular migration, according to Dakar and Rabat. As it expects to collect funds and other economic resources from both African governments and international partners, the 3S initiative seeks to create over 2 million jobs on the African continent. Within the context of stemming irregular migration among the continent’s youth—especially from rural areas— Dakar and Rabat have also pledged for more coordinated action to curb desertification. The move would entail restoring about 10 million hectares of cultivable land. The two countries hope that more job prospects and sufficient food will markedly decrease the urge among Africa’s youth to leave the continent. Senegal and Morocco’s push for an African platform to ensure security, stability, and sustainability is part of the AU’s broader reforms initiative that has been calling for structural reforms for nearly two years. Since the launch of the reform process in January 2017, Paul Kagame, the AU’s chair, has repeatedly noted the continent’s need for more financial autonomy. Achieving financial autonomy, African representatives have maintained, will allow for greater ownership of African policies on critical issues like security, migration, corruption, stability, and accountability of African governments vis-à-vis their own people rather than foreign aid donors.
Senegal is Morocco’s foremost ally in sub-Saharan Africa. Dakar spearheaded Rabat’s return to the AU in January 2017 and has been a vocally favorable voice for Morocco’s aspirations to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). During their meeting in Addis Ababa, El Othmani and Ndiaye also upheld their nations’ historical and cultural ties. They insisted on greater bilateral relations and economic integration.

Rabat- Royal pardons have become customary on religious and major national holidays. The Ministry of Justice announced the royal pardon in a statement on Monday, the eve of Eid Al Mawlid. The King gave several kinds of pardon for  Eid Al Mawlid.  The pardon reduced prison times for 563 inmates. For nine, the pardon commuted their prison sentences from life imprisonment to fixed prison terms.  For one prisoner, the pardon is a matter of life and death, commuting his death penalty to life imprisonment. Three had their remaining prison term pardoned.  For those fined, seven must still pay their fines. The pardon annulled fines for 142 prisoners, and spared 11 prisoners from both fines and their remaining prison terms. King Mohammed VI pardoned 707 prisoners on Eid al-Fitr marking the end of Ramadan in June and 889 on Eid Al Adha (feast of sacrifice) in August, including 184 Hirak Rif detainees. Eid Al Mawlid Nabawi is a spiritual day when Muslims recall the ideals of Islam and recite poems dedicated to the prophet.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation from the Ministry of Labor and one from the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC) conducted a two-day visit this week to Huelva, where Moroccan seasonal workers work on farms over the harvest seasons. The delegations aimed to prepare for the next campaign to recruit Moroccan seasonal workers for berry farms, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Moroccan and Spanish officials agreed on the need to set conditions for the success of the recruiting operation to ensure the best conditions for Moroccan workers. The secretary general of the Ministry of Labor, Noureddine Benkhalil, told MAP that the visit is part of the partnership program between Morocco and Spain on seasonal migration. “It must be emphasized that the partnership model that is the focus of today’s visit is an exemplary experience,” he said. He acknowledged that the conditions “need to be improved, enriched but also safeguarded.” This summer, several Moroccan seasonal workers said that they were subjected to sexual harassment and assault by Spanish managers in the strawberry producing region of Huelva. Following the allegations, Morocco and Spain promised to improve protections for female seasonal workers. Morocco’s delegation and officials, however, said that the partnership should be reinforced. In October, Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim said Moroccan-Spanish cooperation on seasonal employment has “positive results.” He called on Morocco and Spain to reinforce cooperation on seasonal workers in a statement Tuesday. Yatim spoke about seasonal workers with Spanish secretary of state for migration, Maria del Consuelo Rumi Ibanez, when she was on an official visit to Morocco in early October. Speaking to MAP about Morocco-Spanish cooperation during his visit to Huelva, Benkhalil said that “the political relations between the two countries are excellent.” During the meeting, Moroccan and Spanish authorities said that they are committed to enhancing the quality of the labor program in Huelva. The statement came amid an official visit by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco on Monday.

Rabat- Eid Al Mawlid Nabawi is a spiritual day when Muslims recall the ideals of Islam, recite poems and sing songs in praise of the prophet. The eid holiday, like all eids, is a time when Morocco’s cultural habits stand out the most. The festivities vary by region from what to wear to what special dishes to serve.  Assida (semolina porridge), is an indispensable breakfast meal for Eid Al Mawlid. Fez, Meknes, Rabat, and more all serve bowls of assida. Families across the Arab world and in other Maghreb countries like Tunisia and Algeria also serve assida.  It is said that assida was a favorite dish of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Because of this, it is often placed on the center of the table. Harira Ourguia is served mostly in the Draa-Tafilelt region in eastern Morocco, but it is also found in other regions in addition to other types of harira soup. Hassoua is yet another tasty soup served not only for Eid Al Mawlid but also on Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice. Hassoua is made of “belboula,” a common grain in the Maghreb. Butter and evaporated milk are added to give it a creamy quality. Soups make for a warm breakfast on Eid, especially when it falls in winter, but soups are just the beginning of foods that find a space on Moroccan tables.  On Eid holidays, Ramadan, and many traditional occasions, dates take center stage and come in all shapes and forms to adorn Moroccan tables. When lunchtime rolls around, couscous and rfissa cannot be ignored. Next to couscous, rfissa is a very popular dish in Morocco. It is commonly served on Eid Al Mawlid. Finally, there’s couscous. Besides being served every Friday in Morocco, couscous is the highlight of the Eid lunch. Some honorable mentions include tajine (stew), sefaa (steamed couscous with sugar), briouate (puff pastry), pastila (meat pie), and a pumpkin paste known as m’assla. Although Eid Al Mawlid has frequently been a subject of debate in the Islamic world on whether Muslims are allowed to celebrate it or not since many Muslim scholars consider birthdays “haram” (forbidden), many Moroccans see it as an occasion to express their devotion to their faith and love for their prophet. Eid Al Mawlid is also an occasion for Moroccan Muslim families to gather together and share meals. Many Moroccan cities hold events and celebrations in the streets, playing issawa—a religious and mystic music, especially in cities like Fez, Meknes, Marrakech, and Sale. Unlike Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, for Eid Al Mawlid there are no special eid prayers which Muslims perform early in the morning of the eid.

Rabat – In an 80-second video called “Mra Hachak,” the 27-year-old Rabati woman condemned the practices she has seen and experienced in Morocco. The video denounces social hypocrisy, gender inequality, the importance laid on female virginity, unequal inheritance, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. “It’s an outcry regarding what we endure and see as Moroccan women. I talked to some men about our experiences and they were shocked as they haven’t lived what we live,” Aya told women’s magazine Plurielle.  After she obtained her baccalaureate, Aya Moudden travelled to England to get a bachelor’s degree in media, communication, and sociology. She then earned a master’s degree in movie-making from the US. The Darija (Moroccan Arabic) phrase “mra hachak” is an insult referring to a woman as impure, dishonoring, and a source of disgrace. The quick video Aya made has already received 40,000 views. In September, following the widely-publicized case of Khadija—a Moroccan teenager who said she was kidnapped, held, and gang-raped for two months—and Moroccan pop-singer Saad Lamjarred’s second arrest on charges of rape in France, activists launched the “Masaktach” (Don’t silence me) campaign. The social media movement condemned the abuse of women and called for a boycott of Saad Lamjarred’s songs on radio stations. “Masaktach” has been compared to the global “Me Too” movement that spread virally as a hashtag on social media to denounce cases of sexual harassment and assault.

Rabat – Princess Astrid of Belgium will chair a delegation of businessmen and officials visiting Morocco November 25-30. The business event will be marked by the signing of 20 agreements covering several fields. Princess Astrid, representing King Philippe of Belgium, will be accompanied by several ministers and some 400 Belgian business figures from 251 companies. During a press conference for the event, Belgian Ambassador to Morocco Marc Trenteseau said that five federal and regional ministers will come and businessmen representing different economic sectors, including chemistry, renewable energies, transport and logistics, and health. He said that the delegation will be busy with “intense activities” in Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier. Trenteseau said that despite recent developments, bilateral trade is lower than its economic potential, recalling that Belgian exported €890 million worth of goods to Morocco in 2017 and imported nearly €333 million worth of Moroccan goods. The ambassador said that the mission’s main objective is to revive the economic relations of the two countries. The visit is organized by the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Trade Agency in collaboration with Brussels Invest &amp; Export, Flanders Investment &amp; Trade, and the Walloon Agency for Export and Investment (AWEX). During the press conference, the ambassador and other Belgian business representatives said the Moroccan economy has undergone a profound transformation over the last 20 years, owing to the liberalization of the market, the restructuring of the financial system, the strengthening of the rule of law and the improvement of public services. According to the participants in the press conference, bilateral trade in goods increased between 2014 and 2017. The statements, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), noted that Belgian exports to Morocco increased from €803 million in 2013 to €890 million in 2017. At the end of the first six months of 2018, Belgian exports to Morocco amounted to €439 million, representing 2.2 percent more than in the same period of 2017. Belgian imports of Moroccan products reached €172 million, a decrease of 6.6 compared to the same period of 2017.

Rabat – Sanchez announced the forum after his talks with Morocco’s Head Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in Rabat on Monday. Sanchez said that economic partnership between the two countries is “also important, which is why we agreed to organize a Moroccan-Spanish economic forum next year.” Spain has been the primary export destination for Moroccan goods since 2012. Exports to Spain increased by 11.2 percent over the past year. Morocco is also an important trading partner for Spain and its second-largest non-EU market. Besides business, Morocco considers Spain its voice at the EU Parliament. In recent months, Sanchez has voiced Morocco’s migration-related concerns. He also convinced the EU commission for migration to grant additional funds for Morocco to prevent irregular immigration to Spain. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Sanchez said that Morocco has made efforts in fighting irregular immigration. He added that migration “is a shared responsibility and we need to strengthen our cooperation on this issue.” El Othmani also commented on migration, saying, “Morocco is doing everything in its power to fight illegal immigration.”  The Moroccan official added that the issue is “complex and cannot be solved solely by a security approach, despite its importance, we must focus on the development of the countries of origin in Africa.” On October 24, Sanchez spoke about Morocco’s role in controlling migration on the Moroccan-Spanish border. He called Morocco a “strategic actor” for Spain in migration policy. Sanchez said that he defended Morocco’s demands for EU funding to assist the country in managing migration, especially with the sharp increase in the undocumented migrants recorded in recent months taking the western Mediterranean route from Morocco to Spain.

Casablanca – While many Muslims in Morocco and in the Islamic world celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, others prefer not to celebrate the event. Also known as Mouloud in Morocco, the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday is marked as a public holiday in most Islamic countries. For many Moroccan families, the holiday is a time for reunion. Some families gather to feast while others recite poems or sing songs praising the Prophet Muhammad’s life, morals, and character. Al Burda is one of the most celebrated odes for praise of Prophet’s life in the Arab countries. Shaykh al-Busairi wrote the ode in the 11th century. For some other religious people, the occasion is more than poetry reading. It is a spiritual memorial day to review the Prophet’s life, teachings and the suffering he went through to convey and spread Islam religion. Religious people also take the opportunity to preach about the prophet’s life as a model for their lives as stated in the Qur’an and books about the Sunnah. Public celebrations of the birth of Prophet Muhammad did not happen until about four centuries after his death. There are opposing beliefs towards perceiving Prophet Muhammad’s birthday.  Some Muslim people see the his birthday as an event to chant songs of praise. Others view the celebration of the Prophet’s birthday as heresy at variance with Islamic beliefs. Both sides support their views by providing arguments from the books about the Sunnah and about Muhammad’s life. Muslims who do not participate in celebrations on this day may choose to use the time as they usually would or to read Qur’an.  Some others see fasting on this day as another way to celebrate the Prophet’s birth. Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings that prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus preached previously. Muslims also believe that Prophet Muhammad was the last messenger to complete God’s revelation.  Prophet Muhammad’s earliest teachings were mainly based on the oneness of God, the denunciation of polytheism, belief in the last judgment and its recompense, and social and economic justice. Prophet Muhammad was born on the 12th day of the Rabi Al Awwal Islamic month, the year 570 CE of the Gregorian calendar, in the Arabian Peninsula, in what today is known as Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He was orphaned, as his mother died shortly after his birth, and his father died before he was born. His uncle Abu Talib took care of him. At the age of 40, the Prophet first began preaching in Mecca in 610. In 622, he was then forced to migrate to Medina, 400 kilometers north of Mecca, because of the oppression he faced from the Quraysh.  The Quraysh were a mercantile Arab tribe inhabited and controlled Mecca at the time. The tribe viewed Muhammad’s popularity as threat to their ancestral paganism, but mainly opposed the potential impact on their lucrative pilgrimage businesses. The year 622 marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In 630, Muhammad returned back to his native city of Mecca with 10,000 Muslim converts. He later died in his wife Aisha’s home, just two years later, in 632 in Medina.

Rabat – French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on Monday, November 19. Called “Bienvenue en France” (Welcome to France), the international education reform bill is meant to “increase France’s attractiveness” as a study destination. Starting from the 2019-2020 academic year, international students at French universities will pay higher enrollment fees, namely the equivalent of 30 percent of the total cost of their degrees. For bachelor degrees (which cost €10,000), students will be charged €2770, instead of the current €170 registration fee. And for Master’s and PhD degrees, whose registration fees were €234 and €383 respectively, students will pay €3,770. Even with the increase, international students in France will still be “paying significantly less than they do in North America, Netherlands, Great Britain, and most of European countries.” ‘Competing with North America and most of Europe’ France, one of the few Western countries where access to education has until now been nearly free of charge and subsidized by the government (except for a tiny number of elite schools called Grandes Ecoles), is now bidding to join other European and North American institutions in the scramble for international prestige. In a global education system where prestige is associated with the amount of university fees, the size of research budgets, and the quality of education facilities, Philippe argued, it is “unfair” to have “rich international students” pay the same fees as their low-income French counterparts whose parents pay taxes. The prime minister said that the increase will serve to fund more education-related projects. The plan includes renovation works as well as establishment of new scholarships to attract low-income students from the developing world. According to French newspaper Le Figaro, France is the fourth country (behind the US, Great Britain, and Australia) with the highest number international students. Students come from developing and emerging countries, especially francophone Africa, North-east Asia, Latin America, and the Arab world. “We can do much better,” Phillipe said, as he explained how the increase can help French learning institutions be more competitive. The funds will be used in building more facilities to accommodate students and invest more in foreign language learning, he said. For Philippe, France should benefit from its status as a prized destination for higher education. The move has come under heavy criticism from education syndicates, however. They argue that many of the concerned international students are not as rich as the prime minister claimed. Instead, the reform will “reinforce social precarity” for students for many of the targeted students. Fage, a students’ rights advocacy group, said in a statement that “it is not students’ job” to help rekindle France’s “underfunded education system.” The bill will only be applied to students who are not citizens of an EU country.

Rabat – The Spanish prime minister announced in a press conference held today in Rabat that he made a proposal to the Moroccan government “to organize a joint bid between Spain, Portugal, and Morocco to host the 2030 World Cup. He added that through this bid, “ We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it,” the Spanish official said. A joint bid with two EU countries like Spain and Portugal will increase Morocco’s chance to host the massive tournament, especially as FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that he prefers joint bids. Morocco lost its chance to host the  2026 World Cup against the North American trio (Canada-US-Mexico). Earlier today, Spanish news outlet El Pais quoted a source from the presidency of the government, who confirmed Spain’s intention to bid for the 2030 World Cup. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including four Balkan countries,  England and a joint bid from South America: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. The Spanish prime minister arrived in Morocco today. He met with King Mohammed VI, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and other Moroccan officials.

Rabat – According to the Ministry of Culture and Communication, the recently discovered ship ruins date back to a time period between the 18th and 19th century. The ministry is still conducting further research and empirical analysis to accurately identify the exact age of the ship ruins. A recent extension project of the Essaouira port accelerated the erosion of the beach due to changes in water currents and sand deposits. The change in morphology of the beach allowed for the resurfacing of the ship ruins.  A set of wooden beams and remains of the ship’s foundation appeared during low tide on the Essaouira beach. The base of the ship is estimated to have a length of 26.5 meters.  The Ministry of Culture and Communication is conducting “rescue excavations” to identify the causes of the ship wreckage, as well as its historical background. The ministry will also conduct excavations in the adjacent island of Mogador for related archeological ruins.

Rabat – The theme of the exhibition was “Travels of Patti Birch: Passions and Collections.” The Museum displayed 200 items and works of art from Birch’s collection that varies between Islamic, Asian, Pre-Columbian, African, and Judeo-Moroccan arts.  Birch worked as a curator in the Department of Islamic Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Her long experience in the field had enriched the cultural scene of Morocco throughout the years.  During the 1960s, she organized a campaign to restore the historical Marrakech Koutoubia minbar (pulpit in the mosque from which the imam delivers the sermon). Mehdi Qotbi, President of the FNM, told Le Matin, “this exhibition is a tribute to a lady who loved Morocco, who donated 1 million dollars to restore the Koutoubia minbar. “ As lover of Morocco, in 1999, she bequeathed a huge sum of her personal collection to the government of Morocco. More than 1,000 artifacts were gifted to the country as a symbol of love and appreciation.  Today, Dar El Bacha Museum of Confluences in Marrakech has a whole section dedicated to the universal collection of Patty Birch, representing four continents: Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. “Patti and I became close friends as soon as we met, and I would come to understand her passion for art in Morocco and the Islamic world,” said former Ambassador Edward M. Gabriel.  The museum is located in the heart of the old medina of Marrakech. It is a testimony that demonstrates the different facets and multiple components of the Moroccan identity and culture. Dar El Bacha Museum of Confluences is a historical evidence of intercultural and interfaith Dialogue in Morocco. The objects in display tell the stories of coexistence, tolerance and unity between the three monotheistic religions throughout the years. “This is a very beautiful museum and a brilliant exhibition, which reflects the extraordinary richness of Moroccan culture,” President of Arab World Institute, Jack Lang, told Le Matin.

Rabat – The event is organized by the Rabat-based Goethe Institute, under the auspices of the German foreign affairs ministry. In a press release shared with Morocco World News, the institute emphasized the “pedagogical” aspect of the cultural events. The concerts, to be performed in Casablanca’s Mohammed VI High School on November 27 and Fez’s Moulay Idriss November 29, will mostly be for prospective German language students and established Germanophiles to have first-hand cultural immersion in German culture. Prior to performing their two concerts, “the three young German pop musicians from the city of Hamburg will offer a workshop with about 25 German-learning students in both high schools,” the institute’s press release said. It added: “During this educational event, the members of the group will rehearse their songs in German [with students] and talk about German pop music as well as their daily lives as musicians in the country of Goethe.” The two concerts are part of the German foreign affairs ministry’s “Schools, Partners of the Future” (PASCH) initiative. PASCH, the press release explained, envisions promoting the worldwide teaching of the German language and culture. In addition to students from the host high schools in Casablanca and Fez, groups of students from other PASCH schools in Morocco will also be invited to both concerts. PASCH has schools in Rabat (Lalla Aicha and Descartes), Casablanca (Lyautey), Kenitra (Abderrahmane Enacer), and Settat (Ibn Abbad). While the PASCH program traditionally collaborates with leading high schools in countries where it operates, the two concerts in Morocco will also see the participation of students from public schools in Casablanca and Fez.
“There will be much fun,” organizers promised.

Casablanca – Archbishop Cristobal Lopez wrote a letter to his “dear Christian brothers and sisters,” on Pope Francis’s visit scheduled for March 30-31, 2019, at the request of King Mohammed VI. The Pope will visit Rabat and Casablanca. In his November 13 letter, Lopez explained that the pope wants to meet the people of Morocco and “His Majesty the King, in the spirit of an interreligious Islam-Christian dialogue,” which both sides seek to promote, Vatican News reported. “The mission of the Pope is of confirming us in our faith,” Lopez affirmed. The pope wants to “get to know us, share parts of our life, encourage us, pray with us and bless us,” he added. Speaking about Christian migrants arriving to Morocco, Archbishop Lopez emphasized that many Christians in Morocco are “passing through, on their difficult migration, towards Europe.” Lopez also stated that “the Pope’s visit will be a wonderful occasion to express and live our communion with the Bishop of Rome … and the universal Church,” as well as with people of different faiths in Morocco. The pope’s visit will be the second of its kind from a pope to Morocco after the visit of John Paul II in 1985. King Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians. The Catholic Church in Morocco  In a September interview with Morocco World News, Lopez affirmed that the Catholic Church has a good relationship with the Moroccan government.  “The only Christians having problems with the law here are those who proselytize,” he said.  According to Article 220 of the Moroccan Penal Code, anyone who “employs enticements to undermine the faith” of Muslims or converts them to another faith is subject to up to 3 years in prison. The Catholic Church’s presence in Morocco, according to Lopez, does not aim to “recruit” new faithful but to contribute to the common good. “Our mission is building the Kingdom of God. To be able to do this, here like in any other part of the world, we contribute to the common good, fighting against poverty, violence, and discrimination. We aim to help everyone live their lives with dignity as children of God, which is what we all are,” explained Lopez. To achieve the church’s goals in Morocco, Lopez said, “we are working on projects geared towards the education of younger generations, the emancipation of women, the abolition of child labor, and the integration of ethnic and religious minorities.” In March, King Mohammed VI sent a congratulatory message to Pope Francis on the fifth anniversary of his papacy. The King said that their mutual goal is to contribute to the construction of a better future to ensure the principles of harmony, peace, sustainability, and security.

By Josh Babb New reports surfaced this past weekend that CIA officials had concluded that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) most likely ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a contributor for the Washington Post. Khashoggi was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  Trump, in an interview with Fox News, said on Friday that he had been briefed by CIA Director Gina Haspel regarding the agency’s investigation of the journalist’s murder, saying that the CIA will issue a briefing on it this Tuesday. Trump added the CIA assessment would be a “very full report” on “who caused it, and who did it.” Fox reporter Chris Wallace asked Trump as to whether he had heard the tape, who responded, “We have the tape. I don’t want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape.” He added, “I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it … It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.” When Wallace pressed the president on whether MBS had any role in the operation, Trump demurred, “Well, will anybody really know?” He continued, “You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But, at the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.” Last Thursday the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 17 individuals who the Saudis had originally arrested in connection with Khashoggi’s murder. At least one member of the 17 was a close aide to MBS, often seen traveling with the crown prince. The Trump administration’s decision to stick by the embattled crown prince stems from the fact that Saudi Arabia is seen as a crucial ally in the administration’s policy goals in the Middle East, specifically in confronting Iran. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a foreign policy advisor, seems to have a particularly close relationship with MBS.   After weeks of denying any involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, Riyadh officials issued a report last week saying Khashoggi died as a result of a botched operation by “rogue agents.”  Coinciding with the report, Saudi prosecutors indicted 11 participants in the plot, saying they would seek the death penalty for five individuals. The Saudi investigation concluded that MBS had no prior knowledge of the operation, a claim which Turkish investigators have contested.

Rabat- The person taking the video asked the mechanic what he was up to. The mechanic said this way the bus will brake better and will save MAD 5,000, the price of a new tire. The mechanic even acknowledged that doing so was illegal, but he did not stop.  The new-looking tire is an attempt to deceive road control authorities. If caught, the mechanic said he would just pay a bribe and that doing so would be normal in Morocco.

Mohammedia – On November 12, Morocco’s agriculture and fisheries minister, Aziz Akhannouch, met with Ken Isley, administrator of the US Department of Agriculture’s foreign agricultural service, in Rabat. After discussing with the American official prospects of stronger bilateral trade and expertise sharing on agriculture, Akhannouch said that Morocco expects a successful agricultural season this year. According to the Moroccan minister, his department’s efforts and generous weather conditions are expected to drive the 2018-2019 agriculture seasons to an unprecedented harvest. Commenting on the general optimism of Moroccan agricultural circles, Moroccan outlet L’Economiste reported on November 19 that this year’s bountiful harvest level will be a short-lived exciting period before things return to normal conditions. According to L’Economiste, Morocco has received more rainfall at this point in the season than it has for 25 years. By the end of October this year, Morocco had received 1,372 millimeters in rainfall, far higher than anything the country had registered in the last two decades in the same months. The figure, L’Economiste pointed out, is four times higher than what the country generally receives in October and November. There will be an “exceptional harvest this year,” sources told the Moroccan outlet. Another reason this year’s unprecedentedly bountiful harvest will be sustained, they added, is because this year there has been high rainfall throughout the country rather than in just a few regions. Too soon to celebrate Conceding that there is a possibility that rainfall levels will fall by the end of the season, failing to yield the expected record harvest, others have suggested there is at least certainty that the 2018-2019 agricultural season will be far more successful than the 2017-2018 season. Despite visible optimism, they are calling for caution. They have argued that it is too soon to claim a prospective glorious harvest when the most defining factor is whether there will be sufficient rainfall in March and April. “There needs to be rainfall in March and April,” a producer told L’Economiste, suggesting that the current euphoria is somewhat premature. Meanwhile, the agriculture and fisheries ministry is unapologetically optimistic about the prospects of this year’s harvest. In addition to generous weather conditions, the department has invested efforts in maintaining conditions conducive to greater output this year. While there is already a sufficient supply of fertilizer in Moroccan markets, the ministry is planning to muster up 2.2 million subsidized seeds. “All the necessary conditions are in place to assure a bountiful year,” the ministry said.

Rabat- Casablanca police arrested two street musicians, Badr Mouataz and Mehdi Achataoui, who were performing at United Nations Square on Tuesday, November 13, for allegedly “practising violence against civil security forces on duty.” The two young street artists risk up to five years in prison based on the charges, according to Articles 263 to 267 of the country’s penal code. “In case of violence causing bloodshed or injury,” the offender may face a prison sentence ranging from two to five years. “In case the violence caused amputation” or any form of handicap, the offender may face a prison sentence ranging from 10 to 20 years. The musicians were caught off guard when the wali (governor) of Casablanca, Abdelkebir Zahoud, decided to ban street art performances in the area. The decision came after residents complained about loud music causing a disturbance. The square is known for its lively, youthful atmosphere, thanks to the various street performances. Disappointed, many other young artists took to social media to condemn the ban and the arrests, who are likely to spend the Eid Al Mawlid holiday (the prophet’s birthday) behind bars. A number of musicians have organized a sit-in at the square, with banners reading, “The ban is not a solution” and “Street art in silence?   The musicians were not pleased with how authorities and complaining residents described music as “noise,” especially since many streets around the world are stages for many young talents and performers.   Cities across Morocco, such as those most visited by tourists—Marrakech, Fez, Chefchaouen, and Agadir—celebrate street art that is deeply-rooted in Moroccan culture and traditions, back to Al Halqa, the art of storytelling. Other squares like Lahdim in Meknes and the ever-famous Jemaa el Fna in Marrakech are home to Al Halqa and other forms of street entertainment that have lasted for hundreds of years in Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s ambassador to Algeria, Lahcen Abdelhak, also participated in the business symposium, where Benchaaboun spoke on a discussion about “financial/investment aspects related to climate change and energy transition.” The dialogue in the Western Mediterranean, also known as Dialogue 5+5 was launched in 1990, convening Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Portugal, Malta, Italy, and Algeria. The meeting serves as a hub to exchange expertise in business of interest for the region and the participant countries. Panels discussed information exchange and intelligence in customs, tax policies to attract investment, and the opportunities and challenges of Fintech. The Moroccan delegation included Morocco’s director of the Treasury and External Finance, Fouzia Zaaboul, and Chafic Essalouh, director of studies and international cooperation in customs and excise at the Tax administration. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), which reported on the event, did not mention King Mohammed VI’s offer to Algeria for dialogue to normalize relations between the two countries. It has been two weeks now since King Mohammed VI called on Algeria to get involved in direct talks with Morocco to break the stalemate that creates tension between the two neighboring countries.  To date, Algeria has not issued any official statement in response to Morocco’s dialogue initiative, although President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sent a congratulatory message to the King on the anniversary of Independence Day on Sunday, November 18. However, the message also did not mention the Moroccan offer and was just like any formal congratulatory cable Algeria’s government sent to Morocco on an occasion like the Independence Day. Silent on the Moroccan offer, Bouteflika reiterated his country’s “firm determination” to strengthen the bonds of fraternity and solidarity uniting the two fraternal peoples, in favor of bilateral relations based on mutual respect.

Washington D.C – Felipe Gonzalez, a former leader of the Socialist Party and former prime minister from 1982 to 1996, established a tradition in the bilateral relations between Morocco and Spain when he came to power in 1982 by turning Rabat into the first foreign capital a Spanish prime minister visits after he takes office. Since then, this tradition has been respected by all Gonzalez’s successors. Making Morocco the first foreign destination for every newly elected Prime Minister has been a way of demonstrating the value Spain places on its strategic relations with Morocco and the status that Morocco enjoys in Spain’s foreign policy given the pivotal role it plays in the success of many Spanish foreign policy decisions that have a significant impact on Spain’s national security. When he came to power in early June, Sanchez insisted on maintaining that tradition. However, the dates he proposed for visiting Morocco did not fit King Mohammed VI’s agenda. Spain’s many efforts to organize the visit in July, August, and September were unsuccessful. The delayed visit of the Spanish prime minister sparked a debate in the media and gave rise to speculations as to  why Morocco had not responded to Pedro Sanchez’s request to visit the country. Spanish diplomatic and political circles feared that Sanchez would not be able to make an official visit to Morocco before the end of 2018 or before the international summit on migration, which will take place in Marrakech on December 10.  The prime minister announced his visit to Morocco at a press conference last Friday following the Ibero-American summit in Antigua, Guatemala. When Sanchez announced he would meet Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on November 19, he did not confirm that he would meet King Mohammed VI. He only indicated that he had asked to meet him.  The uncertainty looming over Sanchez’s meeting with King Mohammed VI is unprecedented in the recent history of the relations between the two countries. No Spanish prime minister since 1982 has come to Morocco without knowing for certain that he will meet the Moroccan monarch. Eagerness to maintain privileged strategic relations with Morocco  The context in which Pedro Sanchez announced his visit to Morocco and how the Spanish press portrayed it suggest that the new Spanish government is keen to maintain the same positive dynamic and understanding the bilateral relationship has enjoyed in the last decade. Though the Spanish prime minister has not received a formal response to his request to meet with King Mohammed VI, Spanish news agency EFE quoted a Spanish government source as saying that Pedro Sanchez intended to thank the Moroccan government for its efforts to fight irregular immigration and to stress that Spain would remain Morocco’s ally within the EU. Sanchez also seems eager to establish a personal relationship with King Mohammed VI, the highest authority in Morocco, as did the two former socialist prime ministers, Felipe Gonzalez and Rodriguez Zapatero.  Both had established privileged personal relationships with King Hassan II and King Mohammed VI, respectively. Pedro Sanchez is also seeking to maintain the same traditional friendly ties that link his party and Morocco. Sanchez’s eagerness to meet with the Morocco’s highest authority is not based on his particular affection for Morocco, but on strategic calculations and the pragmatism of Spanish policy-makers who are aware of the role King Mohammed VI plays in Morocco’s foreign policy. Creating  a direct channel of dialogue between King Mohammed VI and Spanish officials, including King Felipe VI and his prime minister, has always been viewed from Madrid as a guarantee for  preventing any misunderstandings or deterioration in the relations between the two countries.  For example, when former Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero came to power in April 2004, he was keen to establish a personal relationship with King Mohammed VI.  When King Mohammed VI welcomed Zapatero in Rabat one week after his election, it was the first step the two countries had taken to turn the page of the prolonged period of tensions that marked the second term of former Prime Minister Jose Marii Aznar. That first  meeting contributed to establishing solid ties between the two leaders and resulted in an unprecedented improvement in the relations between the two countries throughout to Rodriguez Zapatero’s tenure as prime minister between 2004 and 2011.  Building on the experience of his predecessors, Sanchez is interested in creating a similar channel for direct dialogue and personal contact with King Mohammed VI to maintain the same momentum the bilateral relationship has experienced over the past 14 years. On the other hand, Sanchez’s desire to visit Morocco also has a lot to do with the key role Rabat plays in the successful implementation of Spain’s foreign policy decisions, particularly with regard to illegal migration, extremism, terrorism, and drug trafficking. It was no coincidence that Sanchez said at his press conference in Guatemala on Friday that “Morocco is a country of the highest importance for Spain, particularly in terms of security, immigration and economic cooperation.” Spain needs to strengthen its cooperation with Morocco on migration, especially following Italy’s definitive border closure to illegal immigrants, making southern Spain the primary gateway for irregular immigrants to Europe. That is why Spain has recently pushed the EU to increase financial support to Morocco to help it effectively manage irregular migration. Morocco also has an important role in the Spanish economy as Spain’s leading economic partner in the Arab world and Africa. It also is the second largest economic partner of Spain outside the EU behind the US. After decades of competition with France on the Moroccan market, Spain has become Morocco’s leading economic partner over the past five years, surpassing France, which held the position for more than five decades. In addition to security cooperation between the two countries, Spanish officials are eager to build on the progress they achieved over the past three decades in the economic relations between the countries. Given the prominent role King Mohammed VI plays in defining the orientations and decisions of Morocco’s foreign policy, there is no better guarantee for the Spanish minister to maintain strong ties between Rabat and Madrid than establishing channels of personal contact and communication with the Moroccan monarch.

By Josh Babb Rabat – World Toilet Day was integrated into rule 6 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which were announced in 2015, calling for equitable sanitation for all and an end to open defecation.  Speaking in 2013, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said, “We must break the taboos and make sanitation a global development priority for all.” The UN aims to eradicate open defecation practices by 2025.  Ban Ki-Moon added, “By working together and educating people about the importance of toilets and sanitation, we can improve the health and well-being of one-third of the human family.” To celebrate this year’s World Toilet Day, HomeBiogas launched the bio-toilet, a small scale biogas system which converts organic waste into renewable cooking fuel in a user friendly way that does not require a connection to a sewage system or water lines. The bio-toilet is relatively portable and small enough that it can be transported on the back of a moped, making it accessible for remote rural villages and other off-the-grid communities. The bio-toilet also offers a sustainable solution for people in disaster areas.  Oshik Efrati, the co-founder of HomeBiogas, said, “The UN Sustainable Development Goals challenged us. We took our solution, the HomeBiogas 2.0, which converts food waste into cooking fuel, and thought about how we could take advantage of that existing technology for the important goal of allowing all humans on earth the right to a decent, safe and clean toilet. We researched the issue for several years.” Efrat elaborated, “We considered all the solutions available today, and visited target populations in Africa and India. For a deeper understanding on the issue, I personally accompanied a woman who travels 2 kilometers/3 miles by foot daily to the desolate wilderness where she defecates. On the long walk there, she explained to me how unhygienic open defecation is and that she and other women sometimes fears for her safety, as they are vulnerable to any passerbys late at night.”  Each year, more than 800,000 children under five die from diarrhea, many due to poor sanitation, according to the UN.  The UN Economic Commission for Africa last month issued its first report tracking the progress towards the SDG’s for Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania.  The report noted all four of the countries had made significant progress in implementing the SDGs framework into their national and economic development strategies. It also highlighted Morocco’s work in addressing climate change and food security.

Rabat – The major Spanish news outlet El Pais cited sources from the presidency, the Spanish prime minister’s office, who confirmed the news. According to the source, Sanchez “has proposed this formula in Rabat to the Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani and King Mohammed VI.” Morocco has favorably received the proposal, according to El Pais’ source. Since June, international media speculated a possible World Cup bid between Spain, Morocco, and Portugal as FIFA chairman Gianni Infantino said that he prefers joint bids for the massive tournament. Since August, Moroccan media reported that Morocco asked Spain and Portugal to form a trio to host the World Cup. Officials from the three football federations have allegedly met to discuss a possible joint bid. In September, however, Portuguese sports news outlet A Bola reported that hosting a World Cup in 2030 is not part of Portugal’s agenda. In a press conference before the Spanish Super Cup final in Tangier on August 12 between Barcelona and Sevilla, Royal Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales told Spanish media that there would be more Spanish cooperation with Morocco’s football federation. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including England and a joint bid from South America: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. Morocco lost the chance to host the 2026 World Cup when the North American joint bid between the US, Canada, and Mexico clinched the rights to host the tournament in June. After the defeat, Morocco immediately announced its intention to bid for the 2030 World Cup. A joint bid between Spain, Portugal, and Morocco may increase the North African country’s chances to host the World Cup. Most importantly, though, a successful Morocco-Spain-Portugal trio would be the first time that the World Cup would be hosted on two different continents. El Othmani received Sanchez this morning in Rabat to discuss bilateral ties and Moroccan-Spanish partnership. The Spanish minister will also meet with other Moroccan officials for talks.

Mohammedia – Tangier has witnessed “spectacular transformations” in recent decades, Liberation wrote, describing the Moroccan coastal city as the linking point between different worlds and continents. The article, which came as King Mohammed VI and French president Macron inaugurated Africa’s first high-speed train on November 15, listed the many other development projects that have sprung up in Tangier since Mohammed VI ascended to the throne. According to Liberation, the transformation of Tangier is part of the King’s royal roadmap to transform Morocco into a continental and world-class business hub. The newly inaugurated high speed train is the “last royal touch to the forced metamorphosis” of Tangier. “Tangier’s appearance has changed in ten years,” Liberation wrote. Where old and dilapidated buildings once stood, the city now flaunts modern architecture, state-of-the-art seaside resorts, and surging financial districts. Ahmed Ettalhi, Tangier’s PJD-affiliated city councilor, told the newspaper that his city’s socio-economic transformation is the result of development projects launched by the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) in 2010. According to Ettalhi, the government, under the auspices of King Mohammed VI, is determined to give Tangier the same appearance as that of its “neighboring European cities.” As Tangier stands just 50 kilometers from Algeciras and 160 kilometers from Malaga, the Moroccan tourist city sees itself as a legitimate competitor of its Spanish neighbors, the PJD official suggested. While the newly inaugurated train has made sufficient headlines, there is more to Tangier’s “metamorphosis.” Since 2010, the city has grown world-class restaurants and hotels and impressive port facilities. With its staggering transit figures in 2017 (3.3 million containers, 7 million passengers, 1 million exported cars), the Tangier-Med Port has established itself as Africa’s go-to destination in terms of port-related activities. Tangier-Med II, an extension project set to open in January 2019, is bound to bring the city’s modernization to even higher proportions, Liberation noted. Tangier is today Morocco’s fourth biggest tourism city, Ettalhi said. But, he explained, the city’s municipal authorities are aiming higher. They want more. “We want to outclass Casablanca. Our aim is to be on the front line.”

Casablanca – Nissan’s Representative Director Greg Kelly has also been involved in misconduct, the Japanese giant automobile manufacturer announced today. The investigation, based on a whistleblower report, found that “over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn‘s compensation.” The improper disclosure, according to Nissan, represents “clear violations of the duty of care as directors.” Nissan also accused Ghosn of other serious acts of misconduct, including “personal use of company assets.” Following the scandal, the company announced that Nissan’s CEO Hiroto Saikawa will propose immediately ousting Ghosn and Kelly from their positions. The case is under investigation in the Japanese Public Prosecutor’s Office. Ghosn is also the CEO of the French automobile manufacturer Renault. The group has not yet made any official statement on the scandal. Renault has plants in Tangier and Casablanca. On October 25, King Mohammed VI received Ghosn along with Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy at the Royal Palace in Marrakech. During the meeting, Ghosn and Elalamy informed the King of an extension project to the Renault plant in Casablanca, to double its production to 160,000 vehicles per year by 2022. The Moroccan Society of Automotive Construction (SOMACA) plant in Casablanca launched the extension project in October. “In 2018, over 400 000 Renault and Dacia vehicles will come out of our two plants. Groupe Renault counts more than 11 000 employees in the country and over 40 suppliers  and partners chose to follow us, creating 50 000 jobs locally,” Ghosn wrote in his LinkedIn on the same day of the royal reception. Ghosn was simultaneously running two companies, Nissan and Renault, before he resigned as Nissan CEO in 2017. Ghosn is considered a highly influential executive within the global automotive industry.

Rabat – El Othmani received Sanchez this morning in Rabat, the Spanish embassy in Morocco wrote in a Twitter post. Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid and Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, and Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj also greeted Sanchez upon his arrival. The Spanish high official is visiting Morocco for the first time since he became prime minister in June and is accompanied by a delegation from Madrid. Sanchez is also expected to meet King Mohammed VI on his official trip to Morocco. Sanchez confirmed his intention to visit Rabat at the 26th Ibero-American summit in Guatemala over the weekend. Sanchez told the press that he is visiting Morocco because of the “historical ties” and the “strategic bilateral relations” that both countries enjoy.

Comienza visita de trabajo y amistad a Marruecos. @desdelamoncloa pic.twitter.com/xPXB0iZips — EmbajadaEspañaMarruecos (@EmbEspanaRabat) November 19, 2018  Sanchez also convinced the EU commission for migration to grant additional funds for Morocco to prevent irregular immigration to Spain. The visit also acknowledges Morocco’s strategic role in fighting irregular migration in line with the Spanish government’s agenda. Morocco is also an important trade partner for Spain. In February, the European Statistical Office reported that Spain remains Morocco’s main trade customer in terms of exports, which increased by 11.2 percent over the past year. Spain has been the primary export destination and importer of Moroccan goods since 2012.  Spain is also calling the EU to speed up the process of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. Last week, the Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas called for a “rapid ratification” of the fisheries deal at the EU parliament. The Spanish minister asked them to approve it in the first quarter of 2019 to allow Spanish fishermen to fish in Moroccan waters.

Rabat – According to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, Morocco seeks to strengthen cooperation with the three EU countries through regular information exchanges on human and drug trafficking and terrorism. The public prosecutor-general at Rabat’s Court of Appeals, Moulay Hassan Daki, voiced Morocco’s intention to improve cooperation with EU countries during a meeting November 14-15 in Valencia, eastern Spain. The meeting served as a platform to discuss tools to fight terrorism. During the symposium, Daki and European officials emphasized the need to increase cooperation between the two countries through exchange of information and experience to combat all international crime. The officials also called for strong judicial cooperation and the use of intelligence data from friendly countries to counter the danger posed by terrorism. Ever since the Marrakech terror attack in 2011, Morocco has modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime. Morocco introduced the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015, which has monitored security threats across the country and assisted foreign security agencies to fight terrorism. Morocco’s international security cooperation is well recognized. In a recent report, the US Department of State said that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” On November 15, Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit and his French counterpart Christophe Castaner discussed on migration and security cooperation. Castaner told the press that he discussed the most important issues for both countries with Laftit, especially counterterrorism and information exchange. Both officials also discussed efforts by Morocco, Spain, and France to fight the trafficking of narcotics and migrants. “The smuggling of migrants is a matter on which we must cooperate even more, given what Morocco is undergoing as a transit country, hence the need to support it and to be mobilized along with Spain on the side of Europe as well as of Morocco,” he said.

Rabat – Bouteflika expressed his “heartfelt congratulations and best wishes for happiness, health and welfare” for King Mohammed VI and the royal family. The Algerian president also wished Morocco “more progress and prosperity.” Bouteflika emphasized the “glorious pages of history telling the greatest sacrifices made by Moroccans, under the leadership of the late King Mohammed V, … and who were crowned by the recovery of independence and sovereignty by the brotherly Moroccan people.” Bouteflika also reiterated his country’s “firm determination” to strengthen the bonds of fraternity and solidarity uniting the two fraternal peoples, in favor of bilateral relations based on mutual respect. Moroccan-Algerian relations are tense. The countries have shared the world’s longest closed land border since 1994 and have differing views on the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria’s congratulatory message followed King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer to Bouteflika’s government in his speech that commemorated the 43rd anniversary of the Green March on November 6. In his speech, King Mohammed VI stretched out his hand to Algeria, calling for “frank and direct” dialogue to normalize the relations between the neighboring countries. The King also acknowledged that the two countries’ bilateral ties are not normal and “much less than acceptable.” The King also said that Morocco stands ready for a “joint political mechanism for dialogue and consultation to break the stalemate” between the two countries. Besides Bouteflika’s formal congratulatory message, Algeria has not officially announced its position on the King’s dialogue offer. However, several Algerian media quoted an anonymous diplomat and an authorized source, who said that Algeria might accept Morocco’s dialogue initiative with conditions. In line with the King’s speech, Moroccan political parties—the Justice and Development Party (PJD) and the Socialist Party (PPS)—announced their determination to visit Algerian parties. Both parties issued statements on November 13 to establish contacts with Algerian parties to support the King’s offer. However, two Algerian Islamist parties rejected the Moroccan parties’ initiative. Mohamed Doubi, the secretary general of Algeria’s Ennahda party, was quoted as saying, “PJD will act as a representative of the Moroccan government. I think that this approach advocated by this Moroccan party will not lead it to what it wants.” The deputy of Algeria’s Front for Justice and Construction party (FCJ), Sliman Chenine, said that Morocco “must first put an end to the tension.”

Rabat – Calcio Mercato reported on Saturday that Benatia might move to AC Milan. However, the Old Lady is not ready yet to deprive itself of the key Moroccan footballer. Benatia was also linked with a move to Spain’s FC Barcelona. In October, Mundo Deportivo reported that Barcelona is interested in recruiting several international footballers, including Mehdi Benatia, to strengthen its defensive line. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his football career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. Juventus recruited Benatia on loan from German giant Bayern Munich in 2016. After one year with Juventus, the Italian football club converted Benatia’s loan agreement to a permanent deal. In 2017 Juventus signed the Moroccan player with a three-year deal worth €17 million. Benatia also plays on Morocco’s national team, the Atlas Lions, and led them as team captain in the 2018 World Cup. On Friday, Benatia and the Lions took on Cameroon for a Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 qualifier, winning 2-0.

Mohammedia – Speaking over the weekend at the 26th Ibero-American summit in Guatemala, Sanchez announced his intent to visit Morocco, months after his first planned visit to Rabat was reported. Weeks after his election as prime minister in June, Sanchez requested a meeting with Moroccan counterpart El Othmani and a “special audience” with King Mohammed VI. But the Moroccan King was on a trip abroad at the time. Of today’s visit, Sanchez told journalists the date was also his request, signaling the importance Madrid accords to the “historical ties” and the “strategic bilateral relations” it enjoys with its North African neighbor. At the Guatemala summit, Sanchez spoke of his Moroccan visit as an important step towards rekindling the two nations’ partnership on “common challenges.” Asked why he had made the first step, Sanchez replied: “I made the request, full stop. That’s all I can say for now.” Later on Sunday, however, a statement from the prime minister’s office gave more details about the visit. “Head of government Pedro Sanchez will thank his Moroccan counterpart Saaddedine El Othmani and King Mohammed VI for their country’s efforts in fighting against irregular migration,” Spanish newspaper EFE quoted the Spanish government’s statement. Also important to Sanchez’s trip to Morocco is the Spanish leader’s desire to “personally reiterate his country’s unwavering commitment” to the partnership with Morocco, EFE reported. While signifying his attachment to the strategic partnership with Rabat and his acknowledgement of the “great job” Morocco has performed to limit the success of irregular migrants’ attempts to cross to Spain, EFE explained, “Sanchez will also guarantee Morocco that Spain will remain its foremost ally in the EU.” Since his election on June 2, Sanchez has established himself as perhaps the most vocal pro-Moroccan voice in the European club. When many in the EU reportedly had doubts and mixed feelings about the EU-Morocco cooperation on migration, Sanchez lobbied for more EU funds to “technically and logistically” assist Rabat’s “enormous efforts” in securing Europe’s external borders. Similarly, as the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement seemed on the verge of collapse over apparently irreconcilable differences between Rabat and Brussels (with Brussels declining to increase Rabat’s financial benefits off the deal), Madrid made it its calling to explain to other EU member states how critical it is for the European body to maintain and nurture alliance with Rabat. “Morocco is a crucial Spanish ally on many issues, including security, immigration, and economic cooperation,” Sanchez has said of his insistence on travelling to Morocco. His visit to Rabat, he added, will be “very important.”

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani made his remarks on Saturday, November 17, for the 11th extraordinary AU summit on reforms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “Morocco firmly supports the AU reforms,” El Othmani said. He added that King Mohammed VI has on various occasions personally reiterated Morocco’s attachment to the success of the recently launched institutional reforms and many other AU initiatives to strengthen Africa’s standing on the global stage. Particularly addressing Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the AU’s incumbent chair, El Othmani said the AU can count on Rabat to contribute to realizing the body’s aspirations. Kagame, who has been the face of the AU leadership for nearly a year, has been resolute in his belief that African leaders should set the stage for a strong and prosperous Africa. Some of the major reforms that the AU has been promoting include an intra-African free trade agreement as well as accountability and performance-enhancing procedures. Of the reforms summit, Kagame said: “The goal is simple: To make Africa stronger and give our people the future they deserve.” Since its return to the AU in January 2017, Morocco has pioneered continental reforms and called for greater inter- and intra-African integration. Rabat has steadily called for fostering intra-African coordination on migration, expertise sharing, security, and renewable energies.

Rabat – Khlie told the press on Saturday that the LGV will offer free trips during the three days preceding its commercial launch. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Morocco’s railways office will define the procedures for acquiring free tickets and the conditions for obtaining them in the coming days.  He added that the commercial launch of all projects inaugurated by King Mohammed VI are planned before the end of November. Khlie made his remarks on the sidelines of the inaugural ceremony of a set of new-large scale railway projects on Saturday in the wake of the inauguration of the high-speed train. The King inaugurated the tripling of the Casablanca – Kenitra railway tracks, the complete doubling of the Casablanca – Marrakech railway tracks, the stations dedicated to high-speed trains (Rabat-Agdal, Tangiers, Kenitra and Casa-Voyageurs), and the new stations of Oujda and Benguerir. These large-scale projects required a global investment of MAD 10.5 billion. On Friday, ONCF announced the ticket prices for the LGV. Economy class tickets for Tangier to Casablanca will cost MAD 149-224. Depending on three peak periods—low, normal, or high—second-class tickets cost MAD 93-139 for Tangier-Kenitra, MAD 115-172 for Tangier-Rabat, and MAD 149-224 for Tangier-Casablanca. First-class tickets cost MAD 162-244 for Tangier-Kenitra. On November 15, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the high-speed train. The train departed for the first time from Tangier with King Mohammed VI and Macron taking the first ride.

By Mohammed Hikal Rabat – Four-wheeled, horse-drawn coaches in Taroudant look similar to those in Marrakech, but there is only one horse. They have a suspended, enclosed body and no door frames, with a convertible roof, and two inside benches facing each other, for four to six passengers.            Ride in the horse-drawn green coach     Designed to offer a panoramic view, these coaches can take visitors anywhere around the town for a very reasonable price.  Visit spice shops Neatly displayed and well-presented with tempting smells, spice stalls are pleasant both to the eye and the nose thanks to an aromatic combination of smells and colors.  These shops offer a variety of spices and herbs: basil, cumin, anise, cinnamon, cloves, fennel, garlic, mint, paprika, rosemary, saffron, and others.  Shop for leather crafts Craftsmen can turn goat, sheep, or cow leather, as one of mankind’s oldest natural resources, into intricately designed practical objects, such as purses, handbags, sandals, shoes, rugs, bracelets, and hats. The art of creating beautiful and useful leather pieces in Taroudant owes its popularity to the city’s tannery, which is also worth a visit. The tannery’s leather products come with great craftsmanship at excellent prices. First-time visitors may be overwhelmed by the strong smell. Putting fresh mint under the nose can ward off the smell. Eat goat tagine It’s true that most or all Moroccan regions boast the tagine specialty, but Taroudant’s unique offering is the goat tagine. In addition to its irresistible taste, goat contains less saturated fat than chicken (72 percent of chicken’s) and beef (16 percent of beef’s), according to the US Department of Agriculture. Taroudant has an abundance of goat farms in its surrounding mountains, making goat meat easily accessible for people in the region. Tour the wall and gates The first thing a visitor will notice is the pentagon-shaped fortified wall that encircles Taroudant. The five large unbreachable gates, called “bab” in Arabic, were made of hard materials to withstand attack. The five entrances are known as Bab Zorgan, Bab Targhount, Bab Ouled Bounouna, Bab Lkhmis, and Bab Selsla. Bab Selsla is the main entrance through which the sultans and any formal convoys used to come. Just beside the gate are stairs that tourists use today to climb up to the terrace to see panoramic views of the city.

Rabat – The report outlines the population’s access to medical and pension insurance, based on the results of the 2017 National Employment Survey. Nearly half of the Moroccan population is covered with disparities by gender, age and place of residence. Out of an estimated population of nearly 34.8 million in 2017, 16.2 million Moroccans (46.6 percent) have medical coverage, 15.5 percent are subscribers, and 31.1 percent are eligible or beneficiaries. The share of women is slightly higher than that of men, 47.6 percent and 45.5 percent respectively, and that of urban residents markedly higher than that of rural residents, 53.4 percent and 35.5 percent respectively. The medical coverage rate is 56.7 percent among people aged 60 and over, compared to 37.1 percent among young people aged 15 to 29. The medical coverage rate varies from 47.4 percent for people living in male-headed households to 41.1 percent for those headed by women. The rate improves considerably with the level of education of the head of the household, from 39.3 percent for persons living in households where the head of the household has no education at all to 78.2 percent for persons in households where the head of the household has a higher education. About 4 out of 10 employed people aged 15 and over have medical coverage The employed labour force is estimated at 10.7 million in 2017. About 4.6 million people (42.7 percent) have medical coverage, 35.2 percent are members, and 7.5 percent are beneficiaries. 47.1 percent of employed working women have medical coverage compared to 41.3 percent of men and 51.6 percent of urban residents compared to 31.8 percent of rural residents.

Rabat – Also known as “Eid Al Istiqlal,” the commemoration of Morocco’s Independence Day also celebrates the return of the royal family from exile in 1955. Morocco freed itself from the French colonial rule on March 2, 1956, while independence was granted from Spain a month later on April 7, 1956. Although Morocco gained its independence on March 2, the North African country commemorates the anniversary of independence on November 18 instead,  at the request of late King Hassan II. In the 50s, Moroccans celebrated the commemoration of the Independence Day on March 2 until King Hassan II ascended to the throne after the death of his father in 1961. This day also reminds older Moroccan generations of King Mohammed V’s accession to the throne on November 18, 1927. Similarly, Sultan Mohammed V delivered his famous speech on November 18, 1955, two days after he returned from exile.   In August 1953, tension broke out between Moroccan citizens, and colonial powers decided to exile Sultan Mohammed V and the rest of the royal family, including late King Hassan II, who was back then  Crown Prince of Morocco. The decision of the French colonizers led to a revolution from the Moroccan resistance and liberation army, who played a crucial role and fought for Morocco’s territorial integrity and the return of the beloved sultan and the royal family. Therefore, the day is a  journey to remember Moroccans’ revolution against colonizers and their sacrifices to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. After three years in exile, the royal family came back home in 1955 when Sultan Mohammed V successfully negotiated with France and Spain for the independence of Morocco. The late King then announced the end of colonial rule, saying in his speech delivered from Rabat on November 18, 1955: “ We are delighted to announce the end of the trusteeship system and protectorate and the advent of freedom and independence.”  The celebration comes two weeks after the yearly commemoration of the historical Green March on November 6.  On October 16, 1975, King Hassan II delivered a speech inviting Moroccan citizens to participate in the famous Green March. “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said. The day also symbolizes Moroccans commitment and contribution to independence.

Rabat – The French Arianespace satellite launching company will orbit the new Mohammed VI-B satellite on November 20 from the Vega Launch Complex in Kourou, French Guiana. The date for the launch in Morocco will be on November 21 at exactly 2:42 AM Moroccan time. Weighing about 1,110 kilograms, the new Mohammed Vl-B satellite will be launched a year after the successful launch of the Mohammed VI-A satellite on November 8, 2017. Morocco’s two earth observation satellites, Mohammed VI-A and Mohammed VI-B, were named after after King Mohammed VI of Morocco. The consortium Franco-Italian satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia and the French Airbus Defence &amp; Space agency developed both satellites. Piloted from Morocco, the new monitoring satellite will be circulating in the same orbit as the first satellite, 620 kilometers above the Earth. “Being complementary, the MOHAMMED VI – A &amp; B satellites will jointly enable a faster coverage of zones of interests,” Arianespace wrote in a statement on November 13. According to Buzz News, the device is capable of turning around the Earth in just 100 minutes and is expected to operate between 15 and 30 years thanks to its photovoltaic mirrors which generate energy from enable solar power. Moroccan engineers and technicians were specifically trained in Morocco and abroad to manage Mohammed VI-B satellite in the same way as  Mohammed VI-A. Morocco is the third African country to have a reconnaissance satellite after Egypt and South Africa. However, Morocco will be the first African country to possess a constellation of earth surveillance satellites equipped with a very high resolution. The Mohammed VI-B satellite is capable of taking up to 1,000 images per day with a resolution of up to 70 centimeters. Mohammed VI–B satellite will be mostly used for mapping and land surveying activities and will help farmers in their agricultural activities. The Mohammed VI-B satellite will develop Morocco’s cadastre and cartography including topographic mapping and its daily update as well as land parcel survey. Having two earth observation satellites will optimize map localisation and enhance the visualization of road and rail networks and allow for updating cartographic background. The new satellite will help in agriculture field by surveying farmlands through a thematic cartography and assessment of soil fertility. It will enable a diagnosis of the state of cultivation which will help farmers optimize their performance and map their irrigated zone. According to Canadian Space Agency, farmers can use satellite data “to help them keep watch over [their] vast acreage” and provide information which can be “invisible to the naked eye—such as soil humidity—with uncommon accuracy.” Satellite data also enable farmers to assess soil moisture and irrigation requirements and “monitor changes in the land on a continuous basis.” It will also allow for a“better forecast precipitation” and help farmers be prepared in case of “insect pest infestations.” By using satellite information, the country will have better observation of the territory, in terms of forest fire control and anticipation. The country can anticipate climate variations such as drought or floods. It will also help in case of natural disasters such as earthquakes or fires by showing a cartography of affected areas. Using this sophisticated-technology will enable identifying water sources and a cartography for humid areas in addition to quantifying water volumes in dams and lakes. According to Satellites 4 Everyone, data of earth observation satellites can “analyse soil composition and moisture content, and measure flood water depth, and then calculate likely water flow characteristics.” The obtained information can help predict the impact of flood events.  The satellite will also be of use to public works and transport especially in monitoring major infrastructure projects such as solar power plants, wind farms and dams. Using high-resolution satellite remote sensing images will provide stakeholders with exact information on the construction progress. Placed about 620 kilometers above the Earth,  Mohammed VI-B will ensure a better border and littoral surveillance, especially in case of soil occupation evolution and undocumented migration. It will also help Moroccan security agencies to track potential terrorists and fight smuggling across borders, namely in the Sahel region. Both Mohammed VI-A and Mohammed VI-B complement each others as they provide joint civilian and military uses to ensure national security against potential foreign threats. The Moroccan Ambassador to the European Union, Ahmed Reda Chami, said in November 2017 Brussels that the satellite Mohammed VI-A “will allow to see what is happening on the national territory, especially in terms of weather. And it’s important for our agriculture.” The Mohammed B-A satellite was also used to successfully to detect illegal activities from the Polisario Front east of Morocco’s defense wall earlier this year. Morocco used satellite images that showed Polisario in the region to prove the separatist group’s illegal maneuvers. The Mohammed VI satellite technology is capable of taking more than 500 images a day with an update to its data every six hours. Moroccan authorities remained silent about the launch of the first satellite which Algeria and Spain deemed it would be used for spying. Florence Sborowsky, a researcher at the Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS) explained Morocco’s silence as a “part of a culture of secrecy whose goal is to pose a threat, but without threatening directly. It is a form of deterrence.” “We thought that Algeria would overtake Morocco since it was the only one to have a space agency. Thanks to the transfer of technology, Algiers had participated in the construction of its small satellites, Alsat 1 and 2. But with a device of such power, Morocco has taken the lead, “said Sborowsky. The Moroccan Ministry of Defense will pilote both satellites in a control base near Rabat-Sale airport. Rabat’s Royal Centre for Remote Sensing (CRTS) will oversee the satellite. The project is part of an agreement between France and Morocco signed in 2013 when former French President Francois Hollande visited Morocco.

Rabat – The King met the newly appointed official earlier today to discuss the prerogatives of his new function as well as the council’s importance in overseeing and regulating free market practices in Morocco.  According to the press statement, the King seized the opportunity to explain to the newly appointed official the need to uphold “neutrality and transparency in all its activities and strengthen the competitiveness of the country’s economy.” The Competition Council is tasked with supervising the implementation of good governance guidelines and ensuring the responsiveness of government institutions. The new appointment also comes at a politically charged context following protests and boycotts campaigns that recently targeted giants of Morocco’s commodity market.  Highlighting the importance of the council’s mission in his vision for an accountable and modernized Moroccan public service, the King instructed to particularly uphold “neutrality, transparency, and independence” in its assessment of the country’s institutions.  The appointment of a new president of the Competition Council is bound to be warmly received in Moroccan business circles, especially as the body is seen in the business sector as an important organ to oversee the respect of free market rules by regulating competition among different market actors. Prior to his appointment as president of the council, Guerraoui was secretary general of the economic, social, and environmental council (CESE). The body conducts studies on Morocco’s socio economic developments and makes recommendations to the parliament or the royal palace. According to the royal press release, the Competition Council’s role, as defined by both the constitution and the royal decree, is to ensure “transparency and equity in economic relationships.” The council will “particularly” conduct analysis to regulate regulation of market competition and checking anti-competition practices as well as any operation that increases economic concentration and monopoly.” Together with Guerraoui, the King also appointed Mohamed Abouelaziz as secretary general of the Competition Council. Morocco has been engaged in securing a place as a hub of investments and doing business. Having launched plans to modernize its performance in all economic sectors, the country is now wishing to upgrade its good-governance and competitiveness records.  While primarily aimed at regulating the national market, the new appointment is set to showcase Morocco to attract investors’ interest. The head of government, Saadeddine El Othmani, also appointed twelve other officials to complete the team that will be charged with implementing the competition council’s action plan, the press release noted.

Rabat – These structural projects are intended to support the substantial development of the sector, with the launch last Thursday of the high-speed train “Al Boraq“, to improve comfort conditions on board trains, to ease the substantial flow of traffic and to reduce travel time. King Mohammed VI inaugurated the tripling of the Casablanca – Kenitra railway tracks, the complete doubling of the Casablanca – Marrakech railway tracks, the stations dedicated to high-speed trains (Rabat-Agdal, Tangiers, Kenitra and Casa-Voyageurs), and the new stations of Oujda and Benguerir. These large-scale projects required a global investment of MAD 10.5 billion. The tripling of the Casablanca-Kenitra railway tracks, which required MAD 5.2 billion, will enable the desaturation of the Casablanca railway junction and multiply the capacity of this line by 2.5, thus offering the possibility to schedule up to one departure every 3 minutes. Eighty percent of the project’s construction works were achieved by national companies, mobilizing 3 million working days and generating 280 jobs during the exploitation stage. The complete doubling of the Casablanca – Marrakech railway tracks (174 kilometers), which required MAD 3 billion, will allow the increase of the capacity of the tracks by more than 100 pc, in addition to environmental benefits (6.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions avoided per year). On this occasion, the King inaugurated the Rabat-Agdal Train Station, an architectural and urban jewel that reinforces the place of Rabat as “City of Light, the Moroccan Capital of Culture”. The new station, which required a total investment of 800 million dirhams and whose opening is in line with the launch of the high-speed train “Al Boraq” connecting Tangier to Casablanca, is one of the four new generation stations inaugurated this Saturday to accompany the launch of high-speed trains. The Kenitra train station, which has been built near the old station, mobilized investments of about MAD 400 million. This project includes the redevelopment of 5 quays of 400 ml in length, and the construction of a 200-space car park. The Casa-Voyageurs train station (MAD 450 million) contains, like the other new-generation stations, technological equipment that meets international requirements for safety, security and quality of services. The Tangier-Ville Railway Station, which required MAD 360 million, consisted in the enhancement of the building of the old station, as well as the construction of a new building intended to house all the premises related to high speed trains. As part of its development strategy, Morocco’s Railway Office (ONCF) has carried out an ambitious program of modernization and construction of small, medium and large train stations. The new stations of Oujda (MAD 170 million) and Benguerir (36 MAD million) are among these stations. These two train stations will improve the conditions of reception and comfort of travelers, respond to the growth of passenger traffic and support the urban development of the cities served.

Mohammedia – When Morocco impressively defeated Cameroon yesterday (2-0), catapulting Morocco’s Lions to Group B leadership with 10 points, qualification was merely mathematical. They still needed to wait for the next group B game between Malawi and Comoros. Despite the joy that came with defeating Cameron, there was in the air a lingering aura that suggested that the qualifying journey still had a next stop. The game against Malawi—assuming first that Malawi defeats Comoros— was still waiting, and it counted enormously for sealing the qualifying spot. So Morocco’s coach, who is famous for his take-nothing-for-granted attitude, seemed to be preaching self-constraint and respect for future opponents. Having coached Zambia in 2012, an underdog squad that shocked the entire African continent, Renard knows what can happen in 90 minutes of football. Meanwhile, Malawi needed two spectacular games—against Comoros today and against Morocco in April 2019—to change Group B dynamics, and perhaps even spoil Morocco’s ultimate joy: qualification. But Malawi’s loss has smashed the country’s hopes to qualify for CAN 2019. The defeat also ends any prospects of surprises in Group B, casting the dice for Morocco, who can now fully relish the joy of sealing qualification before the last game. Mission accomplished, then, as we prematurely reported yesterday. While qualification for Moroccan Lions was simply mathematical after their victory against Cameron, it is now official. And, as they now majestically sit on top of Group B with 10 points, having outclassed Cameroon (second with 8 points) in terms of head-to-head encounter, Morocco’s Lions can already start dreaming about being the continent’s champions. Bottom line: there will be no need to wait until the last game to engage in a thrilling anything-is-possible-in-football exercise.

Rabat- The news comes in line with speculation about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s awaited first visit to Morocco since his election in June. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported Saturday that any awkwardness caused by Sanchez’s delayed visit vanished at Sunday’s World War I ceremony in France. Sanchez met and talked with King Mohammed VI, who was at the event along with other world leaders. The outlet stated that Sanchez made an appointment to visit Morocco soon after his election on June 2, but has not yet found a suitable time for the meeting. The delay may have proved “uncomfortable” for the King and the Spanish minister, especially during the Marrakech Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration on December 10, without Sanchez having made a prior formal visit to Morocco, the host country. During his rumored visit, Sanchez and Spanish Minister of the Interior Fernando Grande Marlaska will meet with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The focus of the visit will be on irregular migration. As of November 14, about 56,000 undocumented migrants crossed the sea from Morocco to Spain this year. According to Spain’s interior ministry, around 3,300 irregular migrants have entered Spain through the highly fortified borders of the two Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, this year. El Pais explained that the visit’s delay never hinted at “bad bilateral relations” between the two countries, asserting that Morocco has always been one of the first destinations that Spanish ministers and diplomats traditionally visited. Morocco and Spain enjoy strong bilateral ties economically, politically, and on security issues. Spain did not hesitate to support King Mohammed VI’s offer of dialogue with Algeria in his speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. In a November 8 tweet, Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell described King Mohammed VI’s offer as “great news.” Spain has also been a vocal advocate for raising the EU’s funding for increased border control in Morocco. In October, the EU approved a €70 million fund to assist Morocco in combating irregular migration. The EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, although not yet ratified, will allow Spanish fishermen to fish in Moroccan waters. The agreement offers 138 fishing licenses to European boats, half of which will be for Spain. Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas asked for a “rapid ratification” of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement at the European Parliament on Tuesday. Planas met with Spanish MEPs and the European Parliament’s Agriculture and Fisheries Commissions, urging them to accelerate the ratification of the agreement so that it can be approved in the first quarter of 2019.

Rabat- Amkouh was one of the 184 Hirak prisoners whom the King pardoned on the eve of Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice), August 21. He had received a three-year sentence for participating in “unauthorized protests” and “undermining territorial integrity.” Local police arrested Amkouh again late in October for practising violence against security forces and “inciting minors to protest” during the funeral of the mother of Hirak Rif detainee Bilal Ahabbad in Imzouren, a town in the Rif mountains near Al Hoceima. Dozens of neighbors and locals attended the funeral in an atmosphere of solidarity and sadness on October 26. Ahabbad, one of the youngest Hirak detainees, had been sentenced by a Casablanca court to 10 years in prison for participating in “unauthorized” Hirak protests. Ahabbad became suicidal after his mother’s death, especially when prison officials refused to let him attend his mother’s funeral despite previous promises. In June, a court in Casablanca sentenced 54 Hirak activists and journalists to 1-20 years in prison. Moroccan authorities had arrested the activists involved in the Hirak Rif protest movement in 2016 and 2017. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.

The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in “unauthorized” protests.

Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Passengers at the Menara airport face lengthy lines at passport control upwards of three hours sometimes. Complaining travelers have been posting negative reviews about the low-quality of service and unprofessionalism of some airport employees. “This airport is a disorganised mess. We arrived and there was no proper queuing system. It took two hours to get through passport control after there being two supposed queues into the main queuing system and people cutting in front of me,” an outraged British traveler wrote on Thursday on the Airline Quality website. He went on to complain of the airport’s border personnel: “I think I found the reason for such queue though as the man who checked my passport didn’t even acknowledge I was there as he was too busy on his Facebook on his phone. Absolutely disgusted with this airport and such attitude.” Another British traveler posted his review on the airport’s customer feedback site earlier this month: “A beautifully dramatic airy building, but queue at immigration was completely unacceptable: the worst I’ve ever encountered in 35 years of flying regularly all around the world! It took us 3.5 hours to get from back of queue to an immigration officer’s kiosk.” He noted that previous reviewers expressed the same frustration “which the airport seems unwilling/unable to do anything about.” An American agreed that the passport control process was too slow immigration, saying it would be a “deterrent” to visit Marrakech. He called on those in charge to add more employees to make the process faster. Following a petition by tourism investors and professionals, Karim Kassi-Lahlou, governor of the Marrakech-Safi region, convened a meeting this month with airport staff to find solutions to maintain smooth administrative and security measures and boost tourism in the red city and the economy of the country as a whole. According to the 2018 tourism statistics released by the Ministry of Tourism, 1.2 million tourists arrived through Marrakech’s Menara Airport between January and July. Licensed accommodation establishments recorded 4.7 million overnight stays.

Rabat- The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has cast doubt on Saudi Arabia’s denial that MBS was involved in Khashoggi’s murder. Several intelligence sources prompted the CIA to reach its conclusion, including a recorded phone call between MBS’s brother Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and Khashoggi. According to the Washington Post, Khalid bin Salman told Khashoggi that he should retrieve documents he needed from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, assuring him that he would be safe. The US officials vouching for the CIA conclusion said that there is “no way” that MBS, who is aware of minor affairs and movements in his country, would not have been aware of or involved in the murder. Despite fingers pointing at MBS as the mastermind behind Khashoggi’s murder, Saudi Arabia has continued to deny its crown prince’s involvement in the Khashoggi case. Khashoggi, a Saudi contributor to the Washington Post at the time of his death and a permanent resident of the US, was killed on October 2 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  Turkish investigators have put forward the theory that Khashoggi’s remains were dissolved in acid and poured down the drain of the Saudi consulate shortly after he was killed by a 15 man hit-squad flown in from Riyadh. On Friday, Mecca and Medina held funeral prayers in absentia for Khashoggi, after Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, called for a worldwide funeral for Khashoggi. According to Islamic law, burying the dead is a collective obligation. If the community of Muslims does not carry out this duty, they are burdened with collective sin.

Rabat – The public show of allegiance to a complex national and cultural heritage took place at a cultural event in Marrakech on Thursday. Under the theme “Moroccan Judaism: Toward Shared Moroccanness,” panelists and participants convened to celebrate films and other cultural works that shed light on “beautiful historical stories of shared heritage and togetherness” between Morocco’s Muslim and Jewish communities. Zhor Rehihil, a curator at the Moroccan Judaism Museum, the body that organized the event in Marrakech, said that Thursday’s meeting between artists and participants—mostly a young audience—was an opportunity to cultivate seeds of Moroccanness in young Moroccan Jews. She said that the country’s history is full of “beautiful shared memories” that need to be taught to younger generations to ensure a harmonious and shared future. According to the Rehihil, the museum has been engaged on the cultural front of the struggle to integrate minorities’ history in official Moroccan accounts. The objective is to instill in young Moroccans from the two communities the skills to appreciate their country’s complex and rich heritage. Thursday’s event, she said, was a culmination “of all the efforts that the Moroccan Judaism Museum has been making for twenty years” to celebrate religious and cultural diversity in Morocco. The museum’s work has been “profound and unremitting,” she explained. Referring to the number of successful cultural events and discussion panels that the museum has organized since 1997—both in France and in Morocco— Rehihil said that acknowledging diverse cultural heritages is necessary for a changing Moroccan society. What it all boils down to, she elaborated, is that “we, Jews and Muslim Moroccans, have worked together because we share the feeling of Moroccanness.” In a 2013 documentary film, “Tinghir-Jerusalem,” Moroccan-Jewish director Kamal Hachkar explored the complexities of Moroccan Jewry. The film received wide critical acclaim for offering a reconciliatory reading of cultural complexity in a world where “binarisms and inward-looking attitudes are on the rise.” The Moroccan Judaism Museum played a key role in the realization of the documentary, the museum’s curator said. Art works like “Tinghir-Jerusalem,” she explained, are part of a growing trend in Moroccan cultural circles. “It is part of the awareness-process of our shared cultural heritage.” Maxime Karoutchi, a Moroccan-Jewish singer and actor, spoke of the “flame of Moroccanness” burning inside him. Karoutchi said he was 14 when he was first introduced to his Moroccan cultural heritage. Since then, he added, he has been “unwaveringly committed to the richness and complexity” of his Moroccan-Jewish heritage. “Peaceful coexistence is a basic truth and nothing can isolate us from our Muslim neighbors,” Karoutchi said. But Karoutchi was not preaching a detached artistic attitude that offers a dreamy and simplified version of the complexities of daily life. His lifestyle and his public statements reflect his belief in an open and diversity-integrating Morocco. In a 2015 interview that went viral, the singer celebrated the double heritage of his upbringing. However, he hammered in the interview: “I am first and foremost a Moroccan.” The artist regretted, however, that nothing substantial has been done in terms of policies to formally integrate the Jewish heritage in Morocco’s official historical archives. Perhaps alluding to the recently rumored royal instruction to teach Jewish history in Moroccan schools, the singer said that including Jewish-Muslim shared heritage in Moroccan school textbooks would be a significant step toward normalizing and spreading the lived reality of the two community’s peaceful cohabitation and common history. Discussions during the event shed light on the often neglected “beautiful history” of Berber Jews, as the Maghreb’s Jewish communities are often called. Also speaking at the Marrakech event, Kamal Hachkar, the acclaimed director of the “Tinghir-Jerusalem” documentary film, mentioned the critical importance of “building cultural bridges.” For him, celebrating diversity is only possible through cultural bridges and dialogues that point out memories and heritage that members of a society have in common. Of his documentary, Hachkar said: “The film was not a historical account, but it intended to understand how it is that one survives attachment to one’s native land.” The film originally set out to “interrogate what, for my generation, has remained of our native culture.” Did he learn anything new from directing the documentary? “I’ve learned that language, primarily Darija and Amazigh [Berber], constitutes the unflinching link between us and our culture of origin,” Hachkar said.

Rabat- The report, according to the Court of Auditors, examines “supporting documents of the amounts received by the political parties for the participation of the state in the financing of their electoral campaigns,” and the “declarations relating to the costs incurred by the representatives of the lists of candidates in the course of their electoral campaigns.” The report shows that out of the 29 political parties that received government funding for their campaigns, only 20 parties reported their campaign accounts within the set deadlines. Several parties, including the National Rally of Independents (RNI) and the United Socialist Party (PSU), filed their campaign accounts after the deadline. The government spent MAD 250 million in the 2016 electoral campaign for the House of Representatives. However, some of the funding was unaccounted for. The political parties received 99.6 percent of the amount allocated for their campaigns. According to the Court of Auditors, political parties declared MAD 287 million in total costs. However, eight parties accounted for 89.5 percent of all parties’ total declared costs. The Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) spent 26.2 percent of the budget, while the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) spent 24.8 percent, RNI spent 7.8 percent, and the Istiqlal party spent 8.8 percent. Other parties spent less than 7 percent of all parties’ costs: the Socialist Union of Popular Forces Party spent 6.4 percent, the Popular Movement party spent 5.5 percent, the Constitutional Union party spent 5.2 percent, and the Progress and Socialism party spent 4.7 percent. The Court of Auditor, chaired by Driss Jettou, added that it received no documentary evidence to justify MAD 9.17 million in expenses, or 3.2 percent of the total amount of the declared cost. Subsequently, the court called on 18 parties to return over MAD 5.77 million to the national treasury.

Rabat – Morocco’s key forward Hakim Ziyech scored two goals for the Atlas Lions during the second half of the match. This is the first time that the Moroccan team has beaten Cameroon in an official match.   Renard and his boys can finally breathe a fresh sigh of relief, especially following the heavy criticism the team received after two successive disappointing displays against the Comoros. Morocco’s key forward Hakim Ziyech has scored two goals for the Atlas Lions during the second half of the match. This is the first time that the Moroccan team has beaten Cameroon in an official match.  Prior to the Morocco vs. Cameroon game, there was apprehension and doubt. But there was also fear and perhaps panic among Atlas Lions’ fans.  True, Cameroon’s lads are no longer the indomitable lions they were when they had the likes of Patrick Mboma and Samuel Eto’o. But they are the reigning champions of the continent, having won the latest Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). They were also Group B leaders prior to taking on Morocco’s Lions tonight at the Mohammed V Complex in Casablanca. So the apprehension and doubts were legitimate. But Hervé Renard had no time for doubt and half-hearted conviction. Speaking with usual vigor of a true believer on the eve of the game, the Moroccan coach said, ‘I am not afraid of Cameroon.’ If anyone still doubted that, tonight was their answer.  Perhaps Renard knew that his team is defiant and utterly different when it has Hakim Ziyech and Mehdi Benatia, two of the many high-caliber names Morocco so unmistakably missed in their latest games. Harnessing the defensive solidity and the tactical prowess they showcased in Russia, Morocco was present when Cameroon looked frightening in the first 30 minutes of the game. After that, it was almost a one-man show for Morocco, except for some intermittent bursts of energy on the Cameroonian left flanks. Morocco parked the bus when it was needed, played fearless offensive football when it was required—which is why, despite Cameroonian players bout the penalty (first goal) and the late-minute red card, it is hard to argue that, this time too, Morocco was lucky. Perhaps there was luck; there always is when one wins. But what we mostly saw tonight is what this Renard-coached team is capable of when there is focus, harmony, and public support: it delivers. Mission accomplished, then!

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The family of an unnamed Moroccan teenager murdered in Canada is choosing to repatriate his body for the funeral.  The seventeen-year-old male was killed in an attempted robbery by two other teens that were arrested by police soon after. The body of the young Moroccan was found Monday night by Montreal police. Police suspect the two accused teenagers placed the body in a way that made the death seem accidental at first in an attempt to cover the botched robbery, according to news sources in Canada.  Prosecutors are seeking to try the teens as adults if they are convicted. The judge presiding over the case has also placed a ban on publishing the names of the underaged victim and suspects.  A candlelight vigil was held for the boy on Wednesday night at a community center on Nun’s Island in Montreal, and over 500 people from his community attended. Mourad Bendjennet, head of the local  Al Jazira Islamic Centre, organized the memorial service. The Moroccan Consulate General Habiba Zemmouri also attended the event, and the Moroccan Consulate will be covering the funeral and repatriation costs of the teen’s body. Zemmouri stated that “[the homicide victim] is a son to us all. He is a son of Morocco. He is a son of Quebec,” and the widespread support of his community resulted in over $20,000 USD in donations by the end of the funeral.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat- Five ministries within the French government came together to issue a joint statement Wednesday for a 17-point plan to stop importing products they believe have an extreme negative impact on global forests. France gave the examples of palm and soy products as environmentally-intensive products France will regulate, according to French outlet France24.  Palm oil, grown in tropical forests, is used frequently in cooking and cosmetics, among other things. Indonesia, the world’s largest supplier of palm oil, recently came under global criticism for the rapid destruction of forests which have pushed native orangutan populations to the brink of extinction. According to the French ministries’ joint statement, between 1990 and 2015, the world’s forest area fell by about 129 million hectares. The beef industry will also face stricter regulation in France. Similar to the palm and soy oil industry, the cattle business requires a large amount of deforestation to produce enough beef to meet the constantly rising global demand. Cattle are also responsible for a large portion of methane released into the atmosphere. Methane is a harmful greenhouse gas, and its increase has been linked to global climate change. The French bill includes financial incentives to foreign countries for abiding by stricter environmental laws, a push for increased taxes on products that pose a risk to forests, and a “zero deforestation” label on consumer goods. France has also joined Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway to demand the European Commission develop a plan to address global deforestation by the end of 2018.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The PSOE began discussions with other factions in Spain’s parliament regarding the revision of the Citizen’s Security Law last June, which went into effect in 2015. The law was originally passed by the right-leaning People’s Party (PP).  PSOE members submitted an amendment which maintains the immediate expulsion of irregular migrants who cross over to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from Moroccan territory. The PSOE alleges that this specific provision “requires a reflection” that should not be considered as the parties debate the current law, but rather reviewed in forthcoming immigration legislation. The practice of immediately returning an irregular migrant who has stepped foot in Spanish territory is known as a “hot return.” Since putting the law into action in 2015, Spain has faced criticism from immigrants rights organization and the European Court of Human Rights for such actions. Last August, Spain expelled 116 sub-Saharan migrants to Africa after they had reached Ceuta, acting against the wishes of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s coalition government, the coalition of which is primarily composed of PSOE members. In October, Melilla migration officials expelled another 30 irregular migrants back to Moroccan authorities.   According to Spain’s Interior Ministry, around 3,300 irregular migrants have entered Spain through the highly fortified borders of the two Spanish cities this year. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska says Spain aims to deter migrants from the dangerous crossing before they reach the multitude of fences and barriers which separate Spain and Morocco.  Jose Alarcon Hernandez, a migration official in the Labor Ministry said: ” The more we help Morocco control its borders, the better it is for everyone.” Spain has been a vocal advocate in for raising the EU’s funding for increased border control in Morocco. In July, the EU approved a 55 million euro fund to assist both Morocco and Tunisia in combating irregular migration. This is in addition to a 100 million euro fund to assist Morocco specifically. In announcing the deal, Spanish officials called Morocco their “preferential partner” in migration management.

Rabat- In a statement published on Tuesday, November 13, the party said that it decided to “establish contacts” with Algerian parties to support King Mohammed VI’s dialogue initiative that he offered in his Green March speech on November 6. The King said that Morocco and Algeria should work together to normalize bilateral ties, announcing Morocco’s determination to consider “the proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard to break the stalemate in the relations between the two countries.” Besides the PPS, Morocco’s Justice and Development Party (PJD) also issued a statement, emphasizing that its members will visit Algeria to find ways to “overcome all disagreements” that prevent the development of cooperation between Algeria and Morocco. It has been 10 days since King Mohammed VI announced Morocco’s willingness to enter into a dialogue with Algeria. Algeria has not yet issued any official statement regarding the offer, but relied on an anonymous “authorized source” quoted by Algerian media to announce its position on the Moroccan initiative. According to the source cited by TSA, Algeria finds the offer “questionable” and “not sincere.” Several Algerian Islamist parties opposed Morocco’s offer to Algeria. TSA reported yesterday that PJD will “act as a representative of the Moroccan government. I think that this approach advocated by this Moroccan party will not lead it to what it wants,” said Mohamed Doubi, the secretary general of Ennahda party . He added that the two countries’ governments should study the possibility of opening the border together. The Morocco-Algeria border has been closed since 1994. The deputy of Algeria’s Front for Justice and Construction party (FCJ), Sliman Chenine, said that Morocco “must first put an end to the tension.” Algerian media and the anonymous “authorized source” said that Algeria would accept Morocco’s offer with conditions.  The first condition is related to Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria wants Morocco to remain neutral in the conflict and keep it within the context of the auspices of the United Nations.  Morocco backs the UN-led political process, but would object to Algeria’s condition about neutrality because Morocco has been mobilizing its diplomacy internationally to defend its position for four decades.

Rabat – During a press conference held Thursday in Mohammed V Stadium, Renard said he does not fear Cameroon and that the essential for him is to drive Morocco to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) as part of the objectives set by the president of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa. Renard did not miss the opportunity to warmly congratulate Mehdi Benatia for his performance with Juventus. Pointing to his return to the national team, Renard said that “his comeback to the team is very important.” For his part, Benatia expressed joy for being called up, emphasizing that his absence during Morocco’s last matches is due to his physical condition, which he describes as “not good.” However, Benatia reassured Moroccans that he is doing well and ready to play with the national team. Tonight’s match represents an opportunity for Morocco to gain ground in the competition and for Renard to prove that he is capable of piloting the Atlas Lions to new heights and achievements. The match will surely be a nail-biter, given the Moroccan team’s weak performance during its double face-to-face against Comoros. This means that they must win the match in order to secure the three points. The second fact is that Cameroon is considered as a knot for the Atlas Lions, as they have never won against them.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation of 4 teams is representing the at the final phase of the robotics competition in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The teams won a qualification phase on June 9, in Casablanca, attended by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Thirty teams aged 7 to 17 competed.  The robot olympiad this year is gathering 500 teams who prepared their project and robots to complete a mission in the agro-food sector, under the theme “Food Matters.” The theme’s importance is illustrated by the fact one in nine people in the world is undernourished. The olympiad’s primary reason for choosing the topic was to use technology to help grow more and better food and reduce waste. Teams will demonstrate their projects and robots before 28 judges, each from a different country. Each team has two or three students and a coach.   The global robotics competition attracts more than 20,000 teams representing 60 countries. A total of 2,500 people attended the international final in 2017. The Olympics project in Morocco is run by Loop For Science and Technology and the Start-up Play Academy, which aims to promote engineering technologies and sciences among Moroccan youth.

Rabat- Passenger injuries ranged from broken limbs to only scratches. No deaths have been reported. The accident, which occurred near Bab Jdid in Fez, was caused by an angry passenger attacking the bus driver, causing the driver to lose control of the bus. A local source told Morocco World News the bus belonged to bus line 25.   The source told MWN that the fight erupted when the driver refused to make an unscheduled stop at the request of the passenger, a waste management worker.   Another recent publicized bus accident took place in Meknes, near Fez. A school bus carrying 43 students crashed and injured three primary school children. Between January and May, 1,187 traffic deaths were recorded, a decrease of 0.67 percent compared to the same period in 2017, while the number of serious injuries caused by traffic accidents was 3,179 (down 5.08 percent), according to the provisional toll issued by the National Committee for the Prevention of Traffic Accidents (CNPAC). The number of minor injuries has increased by 6.18 percent in comparison with the same period of 2017, reaching 46,783. According to some of the latest statistics by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), 24 people died in traffic accidents in Morocco from October 22 to 28, and 1,849 were injured.

Rabat – The outlook comes from a recent Fitch Ratings analysis. As Morocco’s government keeps its traditional policy of subsidizing commodities such as butane gas, sugar, and flour, the budget deficit and public debt figures in 2018 are set to be far higher than initially expected by government calculations. While the government planned to narrow the central government budget deficit to 3.0 percent in 2018 from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017, the analysis predicted the deficit will actually widen to 3.8 percent of GDP. Social programs were prioritized in Morocco’s proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year. The goal of the government’s social policies was to support consumers’ purchasing power and decrease socio-economic disparities. However, as it came at the expense of an inclusive-growth-oriented fiscal policy, overemphasis on social policies only exacerbated citizens’ discontent, according to Fitch. “Despite strong investments in infrastructure and manufacturing capacities in recent years, Morocco’s non-agricultural activity has failed to accelerate and job intensity of growth remains low, resulting in only small improvements in employment and social indicators.” But the picture is not all bleak. In fact, according to the rating, there are many reasons to be optimistic about Morocco’s prospects, especially in the medium and long-term. Positive indicators include “fiscal consolidation leading to a trend reduction in government debt/GDP;” “sustained improvement in the current account balance consistent with declining net external debt-to-GDP;” and “stronger growth potential and an improvement in development indicators” over the medium-term. Suggesting that the positive indicators outweigh the persisting structural setbacks and the potential risks, Fitch Ratings gave Morocco a BBB- rating. The rating, Fitch explained, indicates an overall “stable outlook” for Morocco’s doing business index. “Morocco’s ‘BBB-‘ rating is supported by a track-record of macroeconomic stability, comfortable external buffers and a low share of foreign-currency debt in public debt,” Fitch

By Shaquile Goff Rabat- Beginning November 20, Moroccans will be able to book a cruise to Brazil. Macroisiere, a Moroccan online cruise reservation business, reached a deal with MSC cruises, the largest privately owned cruise service in the world. The cruise service agreed to add Casablanca as a stop on one of its itineraries to meet the growing demand of wealthier Moroccans for luxury vacations.  Moroccans will be able to sail on a 12-day cruise from Casablanca to the cities of Santa Cruz and Tenerife in the Canary islands, before crossing the Atlantic and stopping in the Brazilian cities of Salvador, Ilheus, and Rio de Janeiro. Moroccans also receive a complimentary return ticket from Brazil to Morocco courtesy of Royal Air Maroc.   The MSC Poesia is making the inaugural trip. It set sail from Marseille, France, on November 12, and will conclude its journey on December 2. Casablanca has previously been a popular sightseeing destination for European cruises,  but this is the first time Moroccans will have an opportunity to join the journey from Casablanca and travel via cruise ship from Morocco to Latin America. The decision comes as Morocco attempts to modernize its business and entertainment industry through foreign investment. The companies also predict Moroccans will receive the new route well because Brazil does not require Moroccan citizens to get a visa before entry, according to Moroccan business magnate Ismael Belkhayat.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s offer came on November 6 as he gave a commemorative speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. The Moroccan monarch called for unity and brotherhood in the Maghreb region, saying that decades of cold diplomacy served no one’s interests in a region with a shared history that faces multiple common security and socio-political challenges. Reacting to King Mohammed VI’s message, the US State Department said that rapprochement between Algiers and Rabat could help de-escalate regional tensions between two important players. MAP, Morocco’s state news agency, quoted the State Department as saying that dialogue and improved diplomatic ties between the two neighbors would lead to significant gains for regional security. “The US Government has urged Algeria and Morocco to recognize that improved relations will help the two countries tackle common bilateral and regional issues such as terrorism, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and economic integration,” the Department of State told MAP. Algeria silent, inflexible despite warm international reactions King Mohammed VI’s “frank dialogue” and Maghrebi brotherhood message has garnered positive reactions in Africa and elsewhere. The US’s reading of the regional implications of the royal message echoed reactions by other governments and international bodies. Spain, France, the UAE, Jordan, the African Union and the United Nations Secretary-General were all quick to applaud King Mohammed VI’s move. They hailed the boldness of Mohammed VI’s proposal to set aside decades of hostility and give a chance for peace and diplomatic normalization. The international community’s response has supported the belief that frank dialogue between Algiers and Rabat would also help settle the Western Sahara question. Meanwhile, since the King’s speech, Algeria has shown no signs of readiness to allow the diplomatic overtures Morocco wishes. Earlier this week, Morocco’s ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), announced plans of a trip to Algiers to meet with Algerian political parties. PJD’s statement said that the party hoped to “seek solutions with a view to normalizing bilateral relations and overcoming all disputes that prevent the development of cooperation between the two countries.” But Algerian parties have turned down PJD’s proposal. They argued that necessary steps to facilitate normalization between the two countries should come from governments rather than political parties. “The parties do not have the capacity to make decisions binding on both countries,” said Mohamed Doubi, the secretary general of Algeria’s Ennahda party.

Rabat – In the lower house, 189 MPs voted for the Finance Bill, while 93 rejected it. The 2019 Finance Bill expects the economy to grow at 3.2 percent and an inflation rate of less than 2 percent. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the Finance Bill also plans to ensure stability of the financial equilibrium by maintaining a deficit of 3.3 percent. The government made the MAD 443 billion 2019 Finance Bill, Law 18.80, public in October. It took the House of Representatives 15 days to conduct a final vote, delayed by several debates on its provisions. Throughout the 15-day delay, the ministry delegate in charge of relations with the Parliament issued statements announcing amendments on the bill’s provisions. On November 11, the finance committee at the House of Representatives adopted 56 amendments and withdrew 72 of 224 total amendments.  The amendments include an increase of domestic consumption taxes by 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks. The Finance Bill will also raise taxes on tobacco, specifically raising the prices on cigarette brands Marlboro and Marquise. On Thursday, the ministry also announced an amendment of Article 135 of the general tax code stipulating that “promise of sale” contracts concluded before notaries will cost MAD 200, instead of MAD 1,000. The ministry also speculated that the amendment will “distinguish” the 2019 Finance Bill.

Rabat – Following the inauguration of Morocco’s high speed train (LGV), French interior minister Christophe Castaner spoke with his Moroccan counterpart Abdelouafi Laftit in Rabat yesterday. French President Emmanuel Macron also came to Morocco to take the train’s first ride with King Mohammed VI. The official emphasized that France is interested in consolidating cooperation with Morocco in the fight against migrant trafficking. He added that France has much to learn from the cooperation with Morocco in migration and security. Castaner told the press that Morocco and France have strong ties, expressing France’s determination to further strengthen the cooperation. He told the press that he discussed the most important issues for both countries with Laftit, especially counterterrorism and information exchange. Both officials also discussed efforts to fight trafficking of narcotics and migrants. “The smuggling of migrants is a matter on which we must cooperate even more, given what Morocco is undergoing as a transit country, hence the need to support it and to be mobilized along with Spain on the side of Europe as well as of Morocco.” On October 31, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian emphasized the importance of Moroccan-French security cooperation. The French official said that security cooperation between the two countries “is essential to respond to the threat posed by the return of foreign fighters from the Syrian-Iraqi conflicts.” He also emphasized that Morocco and France must respond to the pressures of terrorism and migratory issues in a “spirit of firmness, responsibility and humanity.” Yesterday, both France and Morocco inaugurated Africa’s first high speed train. Macron, accompanied by Castaner, inaugurated the flagship project with King Mohammed VI. Between January and September, Moroccan police stopped 68,000 undocumented migrant attempts and dismantled 122 active criminal networks. Nearly 47,500 migrants arrived in Spain by sea since the beginning of the year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The pressure pushed Spain to campaign for Morocco in the EU, convincing the European Commissioner for migration to approve a fund of €70 million for Morocco to stem undocumented migration.

Rabat- The report, “Expectations and Aspirations: A new framework for education,” suggests that teaching methods throughout the MENA region are highly focused on memorization and do not provide much scope for students to develop their imagination and critical thinking skills. Morocco and other MENA countries’ curricula rely heavily on rote learning, memorization, and repetition. According to the research, 60 percent of  eighth-grade students in Morocco are required to memorize facts and mathematics and science rules, and the “procedures” of most lessons, if not all. The rate—which also applies for Oman, Lebanon, Jordan, and Kuwait—is “almost twice the international average,” states the report.  The report gives the example of Canada and New Zealand, emphasizing that only 10 percent of their eighth-graders are required to memorize during mathematic lessons. In Sweden and the United States, 11 percent are required to memorize, and 14 percent are in Ireland and Singapore.  The study reasons that when students are only required to memorize rules, procedures, and facts, they become unable to exhibit a basic understanding of day-to-day applications.  The hypothesis is tangible in Morocco. Fewer than half of fourth-graders could read a basic graph in the North African country, according to the 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  Egypt and Saudi Arabia are not any different. Only 55 percent of Egyptian and Saudi eighth-graders could interpret a basic pictogram. MENA students have some of the lowest results in student assessments globally. Only 41 percent of fourth and eighth graders reached the “low” international benchmarks of TIMSS in mathematics in 2015, and only 35 percent of fourth-graders and 47 percent of eighth graders reached the “low” international benchmark in  science. As for reading literacy, only 36 percent of fourth-graders reached the “low” international benchmark. Students in the MENA countries are in dire need of their teachers’ guidance to develop flexible knowledge and skills “that can facilitate independent, complex cognitive work.” The World Bank argues that there should be a balance between rote memorization and high-level problem-solving.  The report states that “the region has great expectations and aspirations. Unleashing the potential of education is attainable, but it will take a commitment by all to make education not only a national priority but also a national emergency.” The substantial overlap in pedagogical methods and labor market issues, says the report, can be explained by “post independence trajectories.” Morocco, colonized by France for 44 years until 1956, has faced challenges concerning “education quality and learning outcomes” like other MENA countries. “However, the power of education to build human capital and to create change depends on its quality, its access to complementary economic and social environments, and its ability to leverage technology smartly,” the World Bank states. Another issue that hinders the pedagogical progress in MENA countries, according to the report, is violent discipline. The World Bank recognizes that some degree of discipline is necessary, however, violent discipline negatively impacts the psychological health of students and hampers their performance at school. Violent discipline affects “children’s physical, psychological, and social development and hampers their learning and school performance, ultimately reducing human capital development,” said UNICEF. Unfortunately, violent discipline is prevalent in schools in the MENA region. UNICEF’s 2013 study of 50 countries suggests that MENA countries have the highest rate of violence targeting children aged 2 to 14 Some 79 to 95 percent of young students in Yemen, the West Bank and Gaza, Tunisia, Iraq, Algeria, Syria (pre-conflict), and Morocco are violently disciplined. Teacher absenteeism, when teachers stay home from school without good reasons plague Morocco and the rest of the MENA region. The World Bank considers this a “chronic problem” that hampers the school systems.  Among MENA countries participating in TIMSS 2015, 16 percent of eighth graders were enrolled in schools whose teachers were absent regularly. School principals reported that teacher absenteeism is a “serious problem.” The problem is more acute in Morocco, affecting 28 percent of students, the report said. Morocco is followed by Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt.  Lack of teachers and financial support is also an issue in Morocco.  Morocco’s Court of Auditors identified similar serious deficiencies in both public and private schools in August. The court noted that some schools have multiple grade levels in one class. Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research Said Amzazi pledged in July that his ministry would launch a national program of generalization and reform of pre-school education in Morocco.  The program, including the 2018-2019 academic year, was to start on July 18 and run to 2028. Reforming preschool practices is a first step in recognizing the concerns in primary and secondary school.

Rabat – ONCF Director General Mohamed Rabie Khlie said that ticket prices will vary according to the ticket class, date of purchase, date and time of trips, discount cards, and whether the tickets are refundable or flexible.  Tickets can be purchased up to three months prior to the trip. Depending on three peak periods—low, normal, or high—second-class tickets cost MAD 93-139 for Tangier-Kenitra, MAD 115-172 for Tangier-Rabat, and MAD 149-224 for Tangier-Casablanca. First-class tickets cost MAD 162-244 for Tangier-Kenitra; MAD 187-281 for Tangier-Rabat, and MAD 243-364 for Tangier-Casablanca. Passengers buying tickets on same day of the trip will have to pay 10 percent extra, and 20 percent extra for refundable tickets. Children, young people, students, and the elderly have privileged discounts. Children under 4 can travel for free, but will not automatically get a seat. Children 4-15 years old will have to pay MAD 50 for second-class and MAD 80 for first-class for any distance. Young people aged 16-26 and seniors over 60 get a 15 percent discount. Students under 26 also get a 30 percent discount for second-class tickets. A group of 19 people or more can also get a 15 percent discount. Twenty-six high speed trains are operating on the new line, but it is not clear whether the trains will serve Casablanca yet as the line does not appear to be finished. The first train from Tangier leaves at 5:55 a.m. and the last train leaves at 8:55 p.m.  King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated Morocco’s first high speed train (LGV) Thursday, November 15, in Tangier. The LGV departed from Tangier to Rabat with King Mohammed VI and Macron taking the first ride. The high speed train will link Tangier and Casablanca in two hours and 10 minutes instead of the normal five-hour train ride. The train will also make stops in Kenitra in Rabat. The trip from Tangier to Kenitra will take 50 minutes while the trip from Tangier to Rabat will take 80 minutes.  Khlie revealed that the high speed train will eventually take 1 hour between Tangier and Rabat after work is completed on the rails between the two cities, allowing the train to travel at optimal speeds. Once completed, the trip between Kenitra and Rabat will take only 10 minutes. Currently, the high speed train actually takes about 30 minutes between Kenitra and Rabat.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Salah Khashoggi, the son of Jamal, said the prayer would be held in Medina following the morning prayer, and a second will be held in Mecca following the conclusion of Friday’s prayer.  The ceremony will be held without the remains of Khashoggi who was killed October 2 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.   Last Sunday, Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, called for worldwide funeral prayers for Khashoggi on Friday. She specifically requested the “janazah” prayer to be performed in the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, Khashoggi’s home city.  Jamal Khashoggi was a contributor to the Washington Post at the time of his death and a permanent resident of the US. Turkish investigators have put forward the theory that Khashoggi’s remains were dissolved in acid and poured down the drain of the Saudi consulate shortly after he was killed by a 15 man hit-squad flown in from Riyadh.  Cengiz had a visceral reaction to the Turkish theory. Taking to Twitter she wrote, “I’m unable to express my sorrow to learn about dissolving your body Jamal!”  She added, “They killed you and chopped up your body, depriving me and your family of conducting your funeral prayer and burying you in Madinah as wished.” According to Islamic law, burying the dead is a collective obligation. If the community of Muslims does not carry out this duty, they are burdened with collective sin. In practical terms, funeral rites for the deceased usually fall to their next of kin. The rites consist of three main acts: Washing the body, holding a prayer for their loved one, and finally internment in the earth. By denying Jamal Khashoggi’s next of kin the rite to his remains, those responsible have added to their crimes by not allowing a proper Muslim burial.  On Thursday, Saudi prosecutors announced the findings of their internal investigation into the death of Jamal Khashoggi, handing down 11 indictments and seeking the death penalty for five suspects. Officials had originally arrested 18 suspects in connection with Khashoggi’s murder.

By Trista Youssef Rabat- Saudi Arabia’s halt is seen as a response to international pressure to end the war.  According to a pro-coalition military source, “The coalition has instructed forces on the ground to halt fighting inside Hodeidah.” Violence in Yemen’s Red Sea port city has de-escalated over the last two days. Saudi coalition airstrikes have decreased despite the bombing of a bus carrying fleeing civilians on Wednesday, which killed seven and wounded four. The port of Hodeidah functions as a lifeline for humanitarian aid to over 14 million Yemenis, acting as an entry point for 80 percent of Yemen’s food and supplies. The United Nations has warned the blocking of Hodeidah’s port will worsen the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, putting millions of starving people at risk of widespread famine. The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October has also increased international scrutiny toward Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy in Yemen. In response to mounting international pressure, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are ready to engage in UN peace talks mediated by UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths.  Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, announced the kingdom’s support for the UN-led peace conference on Thursday: “We support a peaceful solution in Yemen and we support the efforts of the U.N. special envoy to Yemen.” The UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, also publicly announced his support for early peace talks on Wednesday.  Colonel Turki al-Maliki, the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, would not confirm the halted offensive as a ceasefire, saying military operations will continue. “Each operation has its own specifics and pace,” said al-Maliki.

Rabat – South Africa has officially signaled that the ball is in Morocco’s court if the kingdom wants to send an ambassador to Pretoria or receive a South African ambassador. The Moroccan ambassador isan Pretoria left South Africa when the country recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 2004. Since then, Rabat has not responded to a request from Pretoria to accept a South African ambassador. After joining the African Union again last year, Morocco has stated that it wants to re-establish high-level relations with South Africa. King Mohammed VI and former South African President Jacob Zuma decided late last year to raise the level of diplomatic representation by appointing high-level ambassadors in Rabat and in Pretoria. The head of operations at the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), Mxolisi Nkosi, told reporters on Monday that the starting point for any normalization of relations between Rabat and Pretoria should be Morocco responding to South Africa’s request.

Rabat – M-Wallet will enable Moroccans to pay for a wide range of services and goods just with their mobile phones, the African Ecofin agency reported. The “contactless payment” will come into effect by the end of November, in line with an agreement between Bank al-Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, and the telecommunications regulator, in coordination with Moroccan banks. According to the telecommunication regulator, Morocco had 44,027,000 mobile subscribers as of June 30, 2018, and the number is only growing.
Bank Al-Maghrib predicts that M-Wallet will handle as much as MAD 50 billion in transactions by 2023. The platform intends to make payment easier reduce the theft of cash, and replace credit cards that charge merchants monthly and transaction fees.
In 2017, Bank Al-Maghrib started considering contactless mobile payment when Abdellatif Jouahri, governor of the bank expressed his optimism about the project, saying, “The principle of interoperability has been accepted.” Banks and mobile carriers have twice before attempted to launch mobile payment systems. Maroc Telecom launched the Mobicash service in 2010 in partnership with Attijariwafa Bank. Meditel (now Orange) and BMCE Bank also jointly started a cash platform in 2013. The services are not widely used in Morocco.

Rabat – The PJD, Morocco’s ruling party, announced on Tuesday its intention to start visiting Algerian political parties, following King Mohammed VI’s speech calling for a dialogue with “openness” and “good faith” between the countries. The Algerian Ennahda and Front for Justice and Construction (FJC) parties rejected the invitation Thursday, according to Algerian media outlet TSA. “The PJD is the ruling party in his country. Therefore, they will act as a representative of the Moroccan government. I think that this approach advocated by this Moroccan party will not lead it to what it wants,” said Mohamed Doubi, the secretary general of Ennahda. The PJD said it wanted to meet Algerian parties “in order to seek solutions with a view to normalizing bilateral relations and overcoming all disputes that prevent the development of cooperation between the two countries”. If the PJD “wants to achieve positive results, it must take an initiative in a formal framework through the government it leads. The parties do not have the capacity to make decisions binding on both countries,” Doubi said. He added that opening the border must be studied between the governments of the two countries. Algeria’s FJC went even further, saying the onus was on Morocco, reports TSA. “Morocco must first put an end to the tension,” said Slimane Chenine, deputy of the FJC party. “The PJD’s initiative linked to King Mohammed VI’s speech is not in line with our movement’s approach,” Chenine said. Spain, France, the UAE, Jordan, the African Union and the United Nations Secretary-General have supported King Mohammed VI’s initiative to establish a joint political mechanism for dialogue with Algeria.

Rabat –  Morocco, the only foreign country invited, sent cavalry units from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Attendees at the opening show Tuesday were delighted by the cavalry unit’s notable performance.  “The real highlight of the inaugural evening was the equestrian show performed by the Moroccan Police mounts,” wrote the Spanish newspaper ABC.  “The horse connects two countries, two continents and two cultures,” the local daily Diario de Sevilla reported at the show.  Princess Elena De Bourbon and the Mayor of Seville, Juan Espadas, attended the opening ceremony.  Six Moroccan riders performed a classic carousel that drew a round of applause from the audience.  The Andalusian equestrian show continues until Sunday and will be marked by a series of equine shows and competitions. This year, 1,077 horses from 343 stud farms will participate. Every year, more than 200,000 visitors attend the event honoring purebred horses. The show also hosts training sessions for professionals and enthusiasts on the technical aspects of horse breeding.  Dedicated primarily to the training of the mounted police, Morocco’s DGSN Cavalry School, established in 2011 on the 55th anniversary of the national police, trains high level riders who also compete in national and international contests.  Since its affiliation with the Royal Moroccan Equestrian Federation, DGSN has built a team of riders who compete in national competitions.

Rabat – The Atlas Workshops are offered to young emerging filmmakers in the Middle East and Africa.  The primary aims of the workshops is to assist filmmakers who are working on their feature-length narrative or documentary films. It also seeks to create a platform that would allow them to exchange their thoughts and experiences with 150 Moroccan and international professionals. “Eight projects in development and six films in post-production, originating from nine countries, have been invited to take part. They will benefit from a tailor-made day-long consultation with professionals who will provide them artistic feedback, as well the Industry point of view. At the end of the workshop, a jury will award a Development Prize of €10,000 and a post-production prize of €20,000 to the best projects,” according to the website for the festival. Netflix is seeking to boost its market share through business cooperation in the Middle East and Africa. The company is building partnerships across the two regions and investing in local original productions. Morocco seems to be the perfect choice for Netflix as it is a gate to both Africa and the Middle East.  “I don’t want us to be deprived of any great storytellers and I know there’s going to be some in [Arabic-speaking] countries — we know there are, and we want to access them,” said Todd Yellin, Vice-President of Product Innovation at Netflix. “It’s healthy psychologically…when people are exposed to people of other nations and what they do, then you gain understanding, and we start eroding away all the ignorance. So that’s the goal,” he added. Online video streaming services like Netflix are booming in the Middle East and most of Africa. “Rapid growth in premium online video services across the Middle East and Africa is a sure sign that Internet TV is a truly global phenomenon,” said Tony Gunnarsson, principal analyst with Ovum’s Media.

Rabat – In  a tweet,  lawyer Francis Szpiner wrote: “The investigating chamber has just ordered the release of Tariq Ramadan subject to the submission of a fine of 300,000 euros including 200,000 to guarantee the payment of fines and damages.” After a year of denial, the 55-year-old scholar admitted in October to playing “sex games” with two women in France who accused him of sexual assault. A member of the scholar’s defense team, Emmanuel Marsigny,  told the press that Ramadan had “relations akin to sex games of the submissive-dominant kind, but always in a consensual and knowing way.” He added that Ramadan is “relieved” and can “finally speak freely.” La chambre de l’instruction vient d’ordonner la mise en liberté de Tariq Ramadan sous reserve de la remise d’une caution de 300 000 euros dont 200 000 pour garantir le paiement des amendes et dommages-intérêts 1/ — Francis Szpiner (@fszpiner) November 15, 2018  Ramadan was arrested in February after several women filed complaints against him, accusing him of sexual assault and rape. In October 2017, Henda Ayari went public with a rape complaint against Ramadan, who is also a  professor. In June of this year, another woman filed a complaint against the Islamic scholar with a similar story. In September 2018, Ramadan confronted another accuser named “Christelle,” who said that he raped her in 2009 in a hotel room in Lyon, southeastern France. The court meeting lasted 10 hours. Throughout Ramadan’s hearings, the court has been denying his  medical release request.

Rabat – In a statement issued on November 7, the US Department of Defense announced that it contracted with DRS Network &amp; Imaging Systems for $129 million in foreign military sales for six countries, including Morocco, to prepare military software. DRS is to build several army systems: System technical support services, system sustainment technical support services, post production software support services for the direct support electrical system test set, embedded diagnostics, a software loader/verifier, a combined application platform, and power and diagnostics services.  The completion date according to the contract is set for November 6, 2023. In a US  Air Force contract issued on November 14, the defense department announced that L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC received $35,000,000 contract to give logistic support for the Air Force C-12 fleets around the world. The project work will be conducted in multiple countries, including in Morocco. According to the statement, the work is estimated to be completed by December 31, 2018. Morocco remains one of the largest importers of military equipment in Africa after Algeria, which mostly receive its equipment from Russia. Morocco’s primary supplier is the US. In October, Moroccan news outlets reported that Morocco will receive its first shipment of 12 F-16V fighting falcons in 2021. In October, Global Firepower (GFP) ranked Morocco 55th among 136 countries in the 2018 military strength ranking. GFP also said that Morocco owns 284 aircraft, including 56 fighters, 56 attack planes, and 130 helicopters. Morocco also has at least 127 of the almost 200 Abrams M1A1 tanks it has ordered, according to Spanish news outlet Infodefensa. In 2015, Morocco ordered its tanks from the US.  The order also included associated parts, equipment, logistical support, and training for over $1 billion. In total, Morocco has 1,276 combat tanks, 2,384 armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and more than 700 artilleries of three different types: 448 self-propelled artilleries, 192 towed artilleries, and 72 rocket projectors.  In 2017, Morocco also launched the Mohammed VI-A satellite, launched from Kourou, in French Guiana, at the Centre Spatial Guyanais. The satellite helps Morocco monitor its borders and track Polisario’s activities east of Morocco’s defense wall.  Capable of taking 500 images daily, the satellite is dedicated to high-resolution imaging, with high resolution Imager (HiRI) playloads that can give a resolution of up to 70 centimeters and 28 inches. The French satellite launching company Arianespace reported Tuesday that Morocco will launch a second surveillance satellite, Mohammed VI-B on November 21, to increase its aerial surveillance. The satellite will also be launched from Kourou, French Guiana.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The National School of Applied Sciences (ENSA) in Khouribga, central Morocco, will see Moroccan entrepreneurs competing to represent Morocco in the $1 million international contest.  The prize is jointly run by the Hult International Business School, headquartered in Massachusetts, and the UN. The annual competition awards $1 million to university students with the most revolutionary business solutions to global social issues like poverty, renewable energy, and food security.  The Hult Prize competition is often called the “Nobel Prize of students,” and since it started in 2010, it has invested over $50 million dollars in various startups around the world. Boukhal Ferdous, the head of the Hult Prize intra-campus competition taking place in Khouribga, says she believes that his students have a good chance of advancing to the finals in New York to win this year’s Hult Prize. The interdisciplinary competition invites students from different areas of study like science, business, and engineering to submit ideas for start-up businesses that seek to eliminate specific global social issues. The winner of the competition in Khouribga will get the chance to try to move on to the second regional stage, and eventually to the global finals at the UN’s headquarters in New York. Former US president Bill Clinton, a presenter for the competition, remarked, “The Hult Prize is a wonderful example of the creative cooperation needed to build a world with shared opportunity, shared responsibility, and shared prosperity.” The multi-disciplinary faculty at ENSA hope to represent Morocco on the international stage this year and encourage any interested Moroccan students to apply.

Rabat- After a video of the incident was posted online and went viral on Wednesday, the Royal Gendarmerie in Tit Mellil in the Mediouna Province of the Casablanca-Settat region arrested the violent mother. The Moroccan child’s rights organization “Matkisch Weldi” (Do Not Touch My Child) has confirmed that the child in the video, only 6 years old, goes to a private school in Tit Mellil. The organization said the child is on the receiving end of his mother and father’s constant fighting. After the mother recorded herself beating the child, she sent the video to her husband, whom she kicked out of their house in an effort to make him divorce her.  The father later filed a complaint against her with the King’s attorney-general in the Court of First Instance in Ain Sebaa, Casablanca, leading to her eventual arrest, reported Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum 24. In 33 seconds, the spine-chilling footage shows glimpses of the child’s toys lying forgotten amid the violence as he pleads with his absent father: “Come now and divorce her; she’s hitting me.” The angry mother, continuing to strike the child, said to her son: “Are you two ganging up on me?” referring to her husband. The graphic video garnered widespread anger and condemnation from Moroccans.  Under the Moroccan Moudawana Family Code, both men and women have the right to petition for divorce. However, a man may not divorce his wife without the permission of a judge. Women can file for divorce in case of abandonment or violence, but must also get a judge’s permission. In terms of child custody, priority goes to the mother. facing children in North Africa and the Middle East region, according to a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) report. The 2017 report stated that 91 percent of children in Morocco are exposed to violence.  The majority of children exposed to violence are aged between two and 14 years old, and that the violence exists in several forms, including physical, verbal and psychological.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Kalam’s announcement came as protests by the Muslim Rohingya population who fled persecution in Myanmar broke out across refugee camps in Bangladesh. The protestors said they feared more violence if they were repatriated to Myanmar.  Bangladesh had originally brokered a deal with Myanmar to begin returning 2,260 Rohingya refugees from nearly 300 families on Thursday. The UN refugee agency and human rights groups criticized the move to begin repatriation, saying Bangladesh can not force the Rohingya back against their will. “The plan to begin returning the Rohingya to Myanmar comes just days after UN investigators warned of an ‘ongoing genocide’ against the Muslim minority.” The terms of the repatriation deal have yet to be made public. Beginning in August 2017 the Rohingya population in Myanmar experienced army-led violence in response to a series of attacks by Rohingya rebels on military compounds. The Myanmar military’s campaign killed more than 6,700 people and forced nearly 700,000 to flee into neighboring Bangladesh.  The UN Human Rights Commission stated that there were credible reports of “massacres, murders and mass rapes,” as hundreds of Rohingya villages burned across the Myanmar countryside. The sheer scale of the crimes led many nations and human rights organizations to accuse Myanmar’s government of ethnic cleansing and genocide.  Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian government and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has been widely criticized for failing to condemn or even acknowledge the atrocities directed against the Rohingya at the hands of Myanmar’s armed forces.  In a stunning rebuke Amnesty International revoked Aung San Suu Kyi’s Ambassador of Conscience award, given to her in 2012, two years after her release from a years long period of house arrest for her efforts to promote democratic reforms in Myanmar.   Writing in the Washington Post, Kumi Naidoo, the secretary general of Amnesty said, “Although her party does not control the military, Aung San Suu Kyi has allowed herself and her government to become a shield for military abuses.” Aung San Suu Kyi faced further criticism this week when she attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Singapore. US Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly pressed her to protect the Rohingya, “This is a tragedy that has touched the hearts of millions of Americans.”  Pence also told her Americans believe in a “free and independent press,” saying Myanmar’s jailing of two Reuters journalists last December who had been covering the massacre of the Rohingya was “deeply troubling.”  Myanmar is a Buddhist-majority country and many do not accept the Rohingya as true members of Myanmar society, instead viewing them as “Bengalis” who immigrated illegally from nearby Bangladesh. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since a 1982 law went into effect.

By Trista Youssef Rabat- The association will be represented by five Christian converts from Rabat, Fez, and Kenitra, according to spokesperson Jaouad El Hamid. The association has prepared a report on “obstructions” to religious freedom in Morocco that restrict individuals from practicing religions other than Sunni Islam.  The Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms is not recognized by Morocco’s interior ministry as a legal NGO. Before the UN forum, the Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms must meet with Moroccan interior minister Abdelouafi Laftit over its legal status. Jaouad El Hamid told Morocco World News in a statement today that the interior minister was absent at a scheduled meeting with his NGO and the Moroccan National Human Rights Council. Laftit’s absence prevented the association from gaining legal recognition.   Hamid also stated that religious minorities in Morocco face challenges acquiring and maintaining citizenship and are largely excluded from public life. According to a US State Department report, Moroccan minorities, including Christians, Jews, Shia Muslims, and Baha’i Muslims—a subgroup of Shi’ism, make up 1 percent of the population. The report shows several religious minorities remain persecuted by society and also by the Moroccan penal code despite the guarantee of freedom of worship in the Moroccan Constitution.  Hamid described his NGO’s involvement in the UN Forum on Minority Issues as the “first step” in allowing “religious minorities in the Kingdom to practice their beliefs without being restricted.”  The UN Forum for Minorities is instrumental in shaping the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review. Recommendations and insight given by international NGOs aids the UNHCR in giving human rights reports overseeing human rights standards in several countries, including Morocco.

Rabat – The ministry delegate in charge of relations with the Parliament issued a statement on Thursday to announce an amendment that will “distinguish” the 2019 Finance Bill. According to the statement, the revised version of Article 135 of the general tax code stipulates that “promise of sale” contracts concluded before notaries will cost MAD 200, instead of MAD 1000. Individuals and businesses need notarized “promise of sale” contracts when buying and selling items of large value, such as real estate. The modified version of the Finance Bill, which includes Article 135 will be voted on in the House of Representatives before it is sent to the House of Councillors for deliberation. The amendment is one of several changes in the 2019 Finance Bill. The finance committee adopted 56 amendments including an increase of domestic consumption taxes by 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks. The finance bill will also raise taxes on tobacco, specifically raising the prices on cigarette brands Marlboro and Marquise. The House of Representatives is set to take a final vote of the Finance Bill on Friday, November 16, at a plenary meeting. The government has approved a budget of MAD 443 billion for next year’s Finance Bill, aiming to achieve a growth rate of 3.2 percent in GDP. Both upper and lower houses of Parliament have held debate sessions on the Finance Bill.  On Wednesday, the House of Representatives discussed the first part of the Finance Bill. Parliamentary committees also discussed sectoral budgets for each ministry. Today, the House of Councillors will hold two plenary meetings to discuss the second part of the Finance Bill.

Rabat – After touring the sites of the region’s many megaprojects in Agadir and its surroundings, Minister Moulay Hafid Elalamy said he was satisfied at the projects’ pace of development. According to the minister, the successful—and timely—completion of the Souss-Massa projects is part of Morocco’s 2014-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan. Launched in January 2018 under the auspices of King Mohammed VI, the industrial revival of the Souss-Massa region aims to modernize the region’s outputs, creating job opportunities for its young people. Investing in human resources in areas as diverse as automobile manufacturing, aviation, construction, printing, and technology, the plan’s long-term aspiration is to establish Morocco as a global industrial hub. After a meeting with the wali (governor) of the Souss-Massa region and other regional authorities, Elalamy stressed the importance of the region’s industrial development for the country’s economic prospects. The minister suggested that the “economic transformations” recently witnessed in the Souss-Massa region indicate the region’s importance for the whole country’s economic aspirations. He explained, “The project will reinforce the region’s reputation as an industrial platform, making it an industrial hub for employment opportunities for young people.” The minister added that after completing the projects, the region will be an integral part of Morocco’s shift towards inclusive growth. In addition to the initial 11 projects which included manufacturing construction materials, plastics processing, paper production, and high-tech plants, the region is set to host an industrial duty-free zone. The project is reported to have already attracted tenders with world renowned expertise. The objective, according to Elalamy, is to establish the region as a continental hub for industrial investments. The industrial duty-free-zone will be operational by the first half of 2019, according to official documents.
Sounding satisfied and optimistic after touring the industrial sites in progress, Elalamy said, “These projects will create over 12,000 jobs in the region.” The figure is just half of the overall prospect after the projects’ full completion. In the framework of the Industrial Acceleration Plan, Morocco hopes to create as many as 24,000 jobs in the Souss-Massa region alone. The Moroccan government’s ambitions for the ongoing projects mirror Moroccan authorities’ increasingly bold insistence on the need for an industrial revolution to propel Morocco among world leaders in technological advances. The automotive, aeronautic, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and energy sectors have recently been the focus of a number of public statements by Moroccan officials. They have steadily maintained the necessity to be participants, rather than consumers or spectators, in the fast-moving and digitized global economy.

Rabat – The 200-kilometer-long high speed train will link Casablanca and Tangier in two hours and 10 minutes instead of the normal five-hour train ride. The LGV departed from Tangier on its way to Rabat with King Mohammed VI and Macron taking the first ride. The flagship train, which represents strong bilateral ties between Morocco and France, is being driven by a Moroccan rail engineer, who was trained among others in France, according to Jeune Afrique. During testing, the train reached a speed record of 357 kilometers per hour in May. Morocco’s “Al Boraq” high speed service will average 320 kilometers per hour between Tangier and Kenitra, a city north of Rabat, and will drop its speed to 160 kilometers per hour from Kenitra to Casablanca, the pan-African magazine added. The Moroccan government allocated MAD 5.8 billion to the rail’s construction. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development contributed MAD 1 billion. The French government offered loans of 51 percent of the €2 billion overall cost. The French government financed the project via several loans, including an initial investment by the French Development Agency (AFD) of €220 million. Morocco later received a loan of €80 million from AFD to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high -speed train project in October 2017.
 According to Jeune Afrique, Morocco’s railway operator (ONCF) also received funds from several Gulf countries, including a €144 million loan from the Saudi Fund for Development and a €100 million loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.  The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development has also loaned the project €86 million, and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development loaned €70 million. A number of French companies also contributed in the construction of the project, including SNCF, which managed the project, and the Egis Group which took over the civil engineering. Systra, a subsidiary of SNCF, built the rails while Alstom built 12 trains. ONCF will announce the LGV ticket prices on Friday, November 16. The train was originally scheduled to be finished in 2015 but was later postponed to 2017. After a series of delays, however, the project was completed and launched today from Tangier. The project will increase its passenger capacity from 3 million per year to more than 60 million starting in the third year.  In the operational phase, Morocco’s LGV is expected to generate 1,500 direct and 800 indirect jobs. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the partnership led to the creation of the Railway Training Institute (IFF) in Rabat for railway workers from Morocco, France, and other countries in the region, as well as a joint venture  between ONCF and France’s SNCF to maintain high-speed trains, while allowing ONCF to gradually gain skills in this area.

Responding to the verdict, Amnesty International’s MENA Regional Director Heba Morayef stated: “Today’s verdict is another appalling blow for freedom of expression in Morocco and a blatant miscarriage of justice.” “Instead of jailing El Mortada Iamrachen in inhuman conditions, Morocco’s authorities must release him and ensure that his conviction on these bogus charges is quashed,” Morayef said. Many Moroccans also expressed shock at the sentence. Iamrachen had already spent 11 months in solitary detention over two Facebook posts. He was arrested on November 30, 2017 on charges of undermining state security. In one of his posts dating back to December 2016, Iamrachen allegedly applauded the assassination of Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art exhibition in Ankara, Turkey. Mevluet Mert Altintas, an off-duty Turkish police officer was responsible for the attack. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima. The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists and journalists. Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison for their participation in “unauthorized” protests.

Rabat – The Chinese embassy and the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), a Moroccan government think-tank, organized the conference in Rabat. The event focused discussion on “The future of relations between Morocco and China in a globalized world.” During the conference in Rabat, both sides noted the successful relationship between Morocco and China since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Rabat and Beijing in November 1958. Economically, China is Morocco’s third largest trading partner, “and in 2017 Chinese tourism in Morocco grew 150 percent from the previous year,” according to the Arab Weekly. Morocco and China have become even closer in recent years due to an increase in Chinese investment into the country. Mohammed Tawfik Mouline, president of the IRES, recently travelled to China for a visit to the Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, where both sides discussed trade, problems in the Maghreb region, and opportunities for development in the Arab state, according to the university. China has become a crucial international investor in Africa, surpassing the US in 2009 to become Africa’s largest trading partner. In Morocco, this trade has risen to approximately $4.7 billion annually, according to Moroccan news outlet Le Matin.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI received the French president upon his arrival in Tangier at the royal salon of the Ibn Battouta Airport in Tangier. After talks between the leaders, Macron was also greeted by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani; the King’s advisors, Fouad Ali El Himma and Andre Azoulay; Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit; and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Besides launching the LGV, Macron’s official trip to Morocco reflects the strong bilateral ties between the two countries. Flagship project The successful story of Africa’s first LGV high speed train started in 2007, when King Mohammed VI and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the project. Construction was launched four years later in 2011. The project, which included collaboration and loans from several French companies, cost €2 billion. According to BFMTV, the French government “is engaged in financing 51 percent through various loans, including one granted by the French development agency of 220 million euros.” The €2 billion cost represents a budget approximately 15 percent higher than the initial estimate of €1.8 billion, calculated in 2007 at the launch of the project. Morocco received a loan of €80 million from the French Development Agency (AFD) to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project in October 2017. AFD’s loan followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million to establish the project. Among the French companies that collaborated in the building and furnishing of the LGV are SNCF, Alstom, Cegelec, and Ansaldo-Ineo. The cooperation has led international media to describe the LGV as a “flagship project of the bilateral relationship.”

MP Atmoun of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) met with several members of the European Parliament of different political trends to strengthen relations on November 12-14 at the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Moroccan and European deputies examined ways to enhance bilateral relations to take a new, mutually advantageous partnership step with an ambitious dimension and to promote new initiatives, Maghreb Arab Press reported. MPs approved an agenda which aims to “maintain a continuous and regular dialogue on all aspects of the Moroccan-European partnership that should have a positive impact on the pace of negotiations already under way,” according to a statement from the joint commission. Atmoun also welcomed the favorable opinion that the European Parliament adopted in Strasbourg towards renewing the agriculture agreement between Morocco and the EU.  The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the European Parliament voted for it on Monday, November 12. The agriculture agreement aims to extend trade preferences to agricultural and fishing products from Western Sahara in southern Morocco. Atmoun also congratulated the European Parliament on the positive vote for Morocco in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Human Rights on the 2017 report on human rights and democracy in the world. The report was “marked by the rejection by an absolute majority of a draft resolution presented in this report against the Kingdom of Morocco.” Atmoun considered the vote “a recognition of the Moroccan experience by the European institutions in the field of strengthening human rights; and that Morocco continues to respect its international commitments while contributing substantially to the development of international human rights law, which has allowed it to obtain ‘advanced status’ with the EU and ‘Partner for Democracy’ from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.” Atmoun’s delegation included MPs Ibtissame Azzaoui of PAM, Belassal Chaoui of the Constitutional Union party, and Lahcen Sekkouri of the Popular Movement party.

Rabat – Planas met with Spanish MEPs and the European Parliament’s Agriculture and Fisheries Commissions Tuesday, November 13, in Strasburg. The Spanish minister asked them to speed up the ratification of the agreement so that it can be approved in the first quarter of 2019 to allow Spanish fishermen to fish in the Moroccan waters, Spanish Europa Press reported. Planas stressed the Spanish government’s interest in maintaining the agreement, especially for fishermen in Andalusia, Galicia, and the Canary Islands. The minister told the press he received “positive responses” from the MEPs concerning the implementation of the agreement.  Planas affirmed that the legal services of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers of the EU are verifying the agreement. “The Council of Ministers of the EU, in which the [European] governments are represented, is examining the agreement and then it will be sent to the EP for its opinion,” he added. Planas indicated that “it would be a desirable objective” for the European Parliament to approve the agreement in February, so that fishermen can fish in Moroccan waters as soon as possible. Before entering into effect, the fisheries agreement must pass through the Parliament and receive approval by all 28 EU member states. The new EU-Morocco fisheries deal was finalized on July 24, in Rabat, with Moroccan officials. The agreement offers 138 fishing licenses to European boats, half of which will be for Spain. The agreement maintains the same fishing opportunities as the previous protocol, according to Europa Press. The EU agreed to pay €52 million for fishing privileges instead of the €80 million that Rabat requested. The amount is higher than the €42 million in the previous deal which expired on July 14. The EU Commission, represented by MEP Sabine Henzler, assured MEPs that the commission is currently discussing tracing products from Western Sahara with Morocco. Henzler did not recognize Polisario’s role in the discussion over the fisheries agreement. She said that the fact that the UN considers Polisario as the political representative of Sahrawis does not mean Polisario could be considered as a trade representative. Liberal French MEP Patricia Lalonde stressed, in her draft report published on September 11, that the European Parliament should ensure a traceability mechanism to trace products from Western Sahara “so that Member States customs authorities have a clear indication of their origin.” All MEPs agreed that traceability should be made before the Parliament will expectedly vote on the proposal in January 2019, according to pro-Polisario Western Sahara Resource Watch.

Rabat- Balafrej, a member of the United Socialist Party (PSU), told Moroccan news outlet L’economiste in an interview published Wednesday that he has maintained his disapproval of the LGV since the launch of the project. Balafrej, an MP known for his critical views on several issues in Morocco, stated that Morocco is already facing economic challenges. Balafrej addressed Morocco’s “new development model,” arguing that LGV signifies an old model, and Morocco should learn from similar “major projects that did not succeed elsewhere.” Balafrej said that the National Railway Office (ONCF), Morocco’s state-owned sole rail company, has two options for LGV ticket prices: Either set high prices or low prices that would put ONCF in debt.  Balafrej explains that ONCF’s deficit then would be balanced by the state budget and taxpayer money. King Mohammed VI’s “new development model” represents his aspirations for a more developed and confident Morocco. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani cited a study on the current development model in October, showing that it cannot achieve a high growth rate in the national economy and does not provide sufficient employment opportunities. El Othmani emphasized that the government needs to give a strong push for economic activities. For his part, King Mohammed VI said in a speech during the opening session of the new legislative year on October 13  that although Morocco has made tangible progress, “We have to admit that our national development model no longer responds to citizens’ growing demands and pressing needs.” King Mohammed VI arrived in Tangier on Wednesday for the inauguration of the LGV on Thursday with French President Emmanuel Macron at the new Tangier LGV station. The LGV, named “Buraq” after the Qur’anic creature that carried Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, connects Tangier to Casablanca in two hours and 15 minutes instead of the usual 5-hour train ride. The 200-kilometer long LGV is the first high-speed train in Africa. Several French companies collaborated in the construction and furnishing of the LGV, including SNCF, Alstom, Cegelec, and Ansaldo-Ineo. The cooperation has led international media to describe the LGV as a “flagship project of the bilateral relationship.”

King Mohammed VI and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the project in 2007, and construction began four years later in 2011. The project cost €2 billion, and according to BFMTV, the French government financed 51 percent of the project through various loans. In October 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) granted a loan of €80 million to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project. This followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million in 2011 to establish the project.

Rabat – In October, officials in Riyadh arrested 18 men in connection with the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a contributor for the Washington Post, who was killed shortly after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  On Thursday, the country’s prosecutor indicted 11 of the 18 men arrested last month, charging them with murder. The Saudi report on the case stated that Khashoggi died after being administered a lethal drug cocktail and that his body was dismembered shortly thereafter. The location of his remains is still unknown. The prosecutor’s report blamed Khashoggi’s death on the head of the Saudi repatriation team who flew into Istanbul on the same day Khashoggi visited the consulate to obtain the documentation necessary to marry his fiancee.  The prosecutor further noted that the team was not sent to kill Khashoggi, but rather to bring him back to Saudi Arabia. The report contradicts headlines earlier this month in which Saudi officials admitted the death of the journalist was pre-planned.   Turkish officials have insisted that the death of Khashoggi was premeditated and ordered by the highest levels of the Saudi government. Turkey’s President Erdogan also demanded that the 18 originally arrested in Saudi Arabia be extradited to Turkey to stand trial.

Spotify is now available in 13 new countries, including Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Previously users in these markets had to register their accounts in other nations, usually in Europe. The company was founded in 2008 in Sweden.  Spotify named Claudius Boller as the company’s managing director for the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking to Reuters, Boller said the company expects quick growth in the region given the area’s high youth population and the ubiquity of smartphones.  Spotify’s premium service, which allows users to listen to music without advertisements, is available for a subscription of $4.99 per month. The company also offers a free service.  Following the launch of the service on Tuesday, Spotify celebrated by publishing “Arabia Hub,” a collection of Arabic music. The playlist includes music by Palestinian rapper Belly, Morocco’s French Montana, Lebanon’s Massari, and Egypt’s Sherine.

Rabat – The French Arianespace satellite launching company will launch into orbit the new Mohammed VI-B satellite, according to a November 13 press release from the company. The satellite will launch from the Vega Launch Complex in Kourou, French Guiana. The government has not officially confirmed acquiring a new satellite. Last September, Moroccan newspaper Almassae quoted an anonymous military source saying Morocco would launch a new satellite in November. The satellite will undergo a pre launch safety inspection and logistics review on November 19 before the final launch countdown. The Franco-Italian satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia and Airbus built the satellite. The new satellite will reportedly serve non-military purposes such as environmental monitoring, meteorology, and map making.
Morocco’s first satellite, Mohammed VI-A, has also been used to monitor Polisario’s activities. It has also served as a border monitor, taking pictures with a precision of 50 centimeters. The project is part of an agreement between France and Morocco signed in 2013 when former French President Francois Hollande visited Morocco. MOHAMMED VI-A was launched in 2017 and cost Morocco €500 million, a considerable portion of the country’s 2017 military budget of $3.42 billion. Morocco ranks 51st in military spending globally.

Rabat – The lower house of Parliament, chaired by Habib El Malki, will devote its plenary meeting to a final vote on the 2019 Finance Bill, Law 18.80, which was made public in October. The government has allocated an MAD 443 billion budget for next year and aims to achieve a growth rate of 3.2 percent in GDP. The government took 15 days to announce the date for a final vote, delayed by several debates on the bill’s provisions. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives discussed the first part of the Finance bill. Parliamentary committees also discussed sectoral budgets for each ministry. On Thursday, the House of Councillors will hold two plenary meetings to discuss the second part of the Finance Bill. On Sunday night, the finance committee at the House of Representatives adopted the first part of the Finance Bill by majority. Twenty-four MPs voted for it and 13 voted against. On Monday, November 12, the ministry delegate in charge of relations with the Parliament issued a statement to announce amendments to the draft finance bill. On Sunday, November 11, the finance committee had adopted 56 amendments and withdrew 72 of 224 total amendments. The adopted amendments included raising domestic consumption taxes by 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks. Starting January 1, 2019, manufacturers of soft drinks will pay MAD 45 for 100 liters instead of MAD 30. Domestic taxes on nectar will also increase from MAD 10 to 15 per 100 liters. It remains to be seen whether the House of Representatives will accept the amendments or not. The Finance Bill also said that it will raise taxes on several brands of cigarettes, including Marlboro and Marquise.  Marlboro packs will be sold for MAD 40 instead of 33. Article 5 of the 2019 Finance bill said that the minimum tax rate will increase from MAD 567 to MAD 630 per 1,000 cigarettes. Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun estimated that the increase on tobacco taxes will generate additional revenue of about MAD 1.2 billion in 2019. The Finance Bill will also continue to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour by allocating MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund. The government allocated MAD 68 billion for education and MAD 16.3 billion for the health sector to improve and overcome crises in the two sectors.

Rabat – Law enforcement arrested the suspect on the basis of intelligence from the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The statement added that police arrested the suspect in a 4×4 vehicle in Mohammedia. Police found the suspect in possession of 20,000 ecstasy tablets and 1,980 Rivotril tablets, a seizure medication. Both drugs are growing in popularity in the illegal drug market. Police placed the suspect in custody to determine the source of the drugs. The new seizure of ecstasy tablets followed the thwarting of an attempt to traffic 493,700 ecstasy pills into Morocco through Tangier Med Port on November 5. During the operation, police arrested three suspects, including one woman in a car registered in the Netherlands. The ecstasy tablets were carefully concealed in the car’s trailer. The ecstasy pill, also widely known as “the love pill,” affects the central nervous system causing hallucinations and psychoactive effects.

Rabat- Of the 1,000 people the study interviewed, women were more inclined toward emigration than men. Only 31 percent of those who said they would emigrate if they could were men. Unsurprisingly, youth aged 15-24 are the most willing to emigrate. Some 59 percent of the age group said they would not hesitate to migrate irregularly. There are several reasons that prompt Moroccans to ponder emigrating. According to the survey, the most prominent reasons are lack of trust in the Moroccan government, the high unemployment rate or difficulty finding jobs, and difficult social and economic situations. Older Moroccans are less likely to want to emigrate. Of those aged 25-34, 40 percent want to emigrate, while 42 percent of 35-44-year-olds want to emigrate. According to an April study by ReKrute, 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and below are tempted to move abroad in search of better work conditions and quality of life, which includes health care and comfort.  Young, well-trained Moroccans set their sights on Western countries. Canada, which attracts 37 percent of Moroccan professionals, is the hottest destination, not only for Moroccans but for many people in the world. Moroccan physicians and doctors, in particular, experience tough working conditions domestically–underpaid and under-equipped–which prompts them to emigrate. As the Moroccan government continues to fight irregular migration by land and sea to Europe, many Moroccan migrants are persistent in trying to leave the country, mostly by risking the western Mediterranean route by boat. Moroccans account for 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in the first nine months of 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). The Spanish Ministry of Interior indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” EU officials announced in October they would seek to extend economic and logistic support to help Morocco curb irregular immigration.  Moroccan authorities said in the same month that irregular migration attempts had surged 150 percent along the western Mediterranean route from the levels recorded between 2003 and 2015.

Rabat – In a speech commemorating the 43rd anniversary of Green March—a peaceful popular uprising wherein thousands of Moroccans protested against the Spanish colonial presence in Western Sahara—King Mohammed VI said that Morocco is ready for a “frank dialogue” with Algeria. “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” read part of the King’s speech. Cameroon’s Bassek Ba Kobhio and Benin’s Sylvestre Amoussou, who recently took part in the Agadir International Cinema and Migration Festival, extolled Morocco’s newfound African turn. They applauded both Rabat’s cultural diplomacy as well as its economic and financial undertakings in African countries. Ba Kobhio, a Cameroonian writer and film director, is known in African cultural circles for the fierce pan-Africanism of his works. The Cameroonian artist is particularly famous for his vehement criticism of neocolonialism. Both in his artistic works and public statements, he has consistently espoused a feisty pan-African rhetoric. He has maintained that Africa should be responsible for its future. Commenting on King Mohammed’s recent call for dialogue between Algeria and Morocco, the Cameroonian artist said that “the entire African continent should celebrate King Mohammed VI’s peace message to Algeria.” “The continent,” he elaborated, “needs such messages to settle borders disputes and political stalemate witnessed between a number of African states.” The message, he explained, is part of the King’s insistence on strong intra-African relations. Strong and peaceful connections between African countries pave the way for “the necessary African integration,” Kobhio asserted. He added: “It would be surprising to see an African that does not rejoice in the King’s call to Algeria…. Morocco has become a strong partner for the rest of Africa. Just imagine what peace between Morocco [and Algeria] could mean for the continent.” Even in the domain of cultural production (especially music, cinema, and literature) the feud between Algiers and Rabat is increasingly becoming “an anachronistic crisis” that leaders in the two countries need to transcend. Amoussou, whose widely acclaimed 2017 film “An African Storm: A Continent Under Influence ” was screened at the Agadir festival, echoed the same pan-African sentiment. Since Morocco’s return to the African Union (AU) in January 2017, the country has been at the forefront of pan-African initiatives, he suggested. For the Beninese filmmaker, the King’s latest call for genuine political will to end the Rabat-Algiers decades-long saga of cold diplomatic ties came as further validation of the King’s sincere belief in Africa’s ability to solve its own issues. “Africa must unite,” the filmmaker hammered into the audience. He added that “only through South-South cooperation and African unity, as pioneered by Morocco and its King, can the African continent finds its way toward socio-economic development.” Both artists suggested that it is time that the continent settled divergences coming from “colonial borders.” Strong African support While the two artists’ comments can easily be perceived as the traditional artistic inclination to paint reality in a more beautiful and palatable light, the sentiment of unity and pan-Africanism they espouse has made the rounds in many African circles since the King’s Green March commemoration speech. AU’s commission chair, Moussa Faki Mahamat, recently lauded Morocco’s efforts for “frank dialogue” with its Algerian neighbor. According to the African diplomat, King Mohammed’s speech reflected the African Union’s agenda of “reviving regional cooperation.” Just recently, Morocco’s ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), announced plans to travel to Algeria to meet fellow representatives of Algerian political parties to discuss the terms and feasibility of the King’s dialogue and brotherhood offer. For all the excitement and euphoria that King Mohammed’s message has generated in Africa and worldwide, it is yet to be seen how authorities in Algiers will receive King Mohammed VI’s extended brotherly hand.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced via a communique that the council will be held on Friday instead.  The meeting is set to approve the draft law related to the establishment of a Moroccan health insurance fund; examine three other draft decrees dedicated to improving conditions for the installment and use of marine fishing vessels; and create an organization for Tangier’s Training Institute for Renewable Energy and Efficient Energy. The final draft decree concerns the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System. A few changes also occurred in French President Emmanuel Macron’s schedule, shortening his visit to Morocco on the day of the LGV inauguration. Instead of landing in Rabat and sharing lunch with King Mohammed VI, President Macron may land in Tangier’s Ibn Battouta airport and go directly to Tangier’s new LGV train station to attend the ceremony, then quickly fly back to France to be present at another ceremony at ÉlyséePalace in Paris. The French and Moroccan flags, which decorated the streets of Rabat at the start of the week in anticipation of Macron’s visit, were taken down. Tangier’s new LGV station is ready to receive passengers. Photos of the polished station have been circulating online since Monday. Several French companies collaborated in the construction and furnishing of the LGV, including SNCF, Alstom, Cegelec, and Ansaldo-Ineo. The cooperation has led international media to describe the LGV as a “flagship project of the bilateral relationship.”

King Mohammed VI and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the project in 2007, andconstruction beganfour years later in 2011. The project cost €2 billion, and according to BFMTV, the French government financed 51 percent of the project through various loans. In October 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) granted a loan of €80 million to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project. This followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million in 2011 to establish the project.

In response to the threat diabetes poses, the Ministry of Health has made diabetes prevention and control a key priority for its sectoral strategy, mainly through extending the range of healthcare services.  In addition to complications related to conception and pregnancy, diabetes, if left untreated, can lead to blindness, kidney disease and lower limb amputation.  Annually, the ministry budgets around MAD 156 million for the purchase of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs. The agency also commits around MAD 15 million for the acquisition of  medical devices to screen for diabetes and monitor patients.  748,000 diabetics in Morocco, around 64 percent of which are women, receive free medication and primary care.  The ministry also furthered their partnerships with social welfare organizations and the private sector, specifically in the areas of therapeutic intervention and childhood diabetes.

By  Trista Youssef Rabat – Fighting between Israeli and Palestinian forces, which  began on Sunday and ended with a ceasefire on Tuesday night, reached its worst levels since a 50-day war in 2014. The violence started when Palestinian forces fired rockets at Israel in response to a covert Israeli operation that killed seven Palestinians in Gaza.  Two Israelis and at least 14 Palestinians were killed during the violent, two-day-long flare-up. Although never officially confirmed by the Israeli government, an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire announced by Hamas on Tuesday night is still in place. Lieberman responded to the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to accept a truce with Gaza as “surrendering to terror.”  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the truce during a speech, saying: “At these moments, leadership is not about doing the easy thing. Leadership is about doing the right thing, even if it is difficult.”  Lieberman told reporters in Jerusalem on Wednesday: “Despite the difference in opinion, I tried to stay a faithful member of the government for a long as possible…but it has failed.” Palestinians view the defense minister’s resignation as a political victory. Hamas Spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri called Lieberman’s resignation a “recognition of the defeat before the growing force of the Palestinian resistance,” which showed a “state of weakness that has overcome the Israelis.” Lieberman’s resignation removes the far-right Israel Beitenu party from Netanyahu’s conservative coalition, weakening the prime minister’s position in upcoming elections. The loss of five Israel Beitenu seats gives Netanyahu control over only 61 of 120 parliamentary seats.

Rabat- The mother recorded her son, who appeared to be just six years old, as she ruthlessly swatted his bare skin. “Tell you father to divorce me,” she menaced while the child screamed and wailed in pain. The 33-second-long footage shows glimpses of the child’s toys lying forgotten amid the violence, as he pleads for his absent father to “come now and divorce her; she’s hitting me.” The angry mother, continuing to strike the child, said to her son: “are you two ganging up on me?” The woman’s identity has not yet been identified. Moroccans on social media, appalled, condemned her behavior as child abuse. Moroccan child’s rights organization “Matkisch Weldi” (meaning “do not touch my child” in English) denounced the violence and called on authorities to open an immediate investigation into the incident, said Moroccan news outlet Alyaoum24.

Rabat – In a press conference in Casablanca today, the lawyers said that Bouachrine was tried as a person and not as a journalist. The team also said that the trial took into account mitigating circumstances. On November 9, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Bouachrine to 12 years in prison. The journalist was arrested and jailed in February after several women journalists working for him at Akhbar Al Youm newspaper filed complaints, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, and harassment. In the press conference, the women’s lawyers said that the trial was concluded after nine months and 80 hearings. The lawyers added that each hearing lasted for 8 to 12 hours, “ensuring” a fair trial. Ten of the women’s lawyers participated in the press conference. In response to several statements from Bouachrine’s supporters, the lawyers said that the trial had nothing to do with politics or of the opinions of Bouachrine. After the sentencing hearing, Justice and Development Party (PJD) member Abdelali Hamidine said the trial had “political motives.” Prince Moulay Hicham, the King’s cousin, echoed the same statement. Moulay Hicham said there were national and Arab political motives behind the prosecution of a journalist who was a “nuisance because of his writings.” In response, the women’s lawyers said that Bouachrine had a conflict with the law and not with themselves. The team said that the journalist enjoyed all his rights, including the right to know why he was arrested. He also had the right to remain silent and the right to speak with his lawyer. The team confirmed that evidence and videos seized during Bouachrine’s arrest were featured in the trial. Police had seized 50 tapes, which the lawyers said confirmed the charges attributed to him. The defense team said that the scientific laboratory of the royal gendarmerie conducted an investigation to determine whether the videos were faked.  Experts concluded that the videos were not faked as Bouachrine’s defense team claimed throughout the trial. The lawyers of the victims said that Bouachrine was convicted of the charges attributed to him, including sexual exploitation and human trafficking, crimes that can carry sentences of up to 30 years in prison. “But the court made Bouachrine enjoy maximum mitigating circumstances (12 years in prison) with fines.” The lawyers added that the fines will not solve the social and mental damages which will last forever for the victims.

Rabat – Initiated in June 2004, the Morocco-US FTA entered into force in January 2006. The agreement essentially applies to agriculture and related products. Gregg Doud, the US trade representative’s chief agricultural negotiator, and Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s agriculture and fisheries minister, met in Rabat on Tuesday, November 13, to discuss strengthening bilateral ties in terms of technical and trade cooperation in agriculture. In a statement highlighting the most important points of the meeting between the two officials, the Moroccan agricultural ministry indicated that the two officials stressed the importance of upholding the “specially strategic” ties binding Rabat and Washington. The ministry’s statement also underlined that the Akhannouch and Doud meeting came just weeks after Aziz Akhannouch met with Ken Isley, administrator of the US Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). On October 23, the two officials mentioned the need for both countries to expand exports and agro-science bilateral ties. The impetus for US-Morocco agricultural cooperation has been reported to derive from a busy agenda for Moroccan agricultural authorities. Akhannouch has launched cooperation campaigns with other partners (Japan, the EU, and China, for example) to materialize Morocco’s 2008-initiated Green Morocco Plan. Speaking on Tuesday after his meeting with Gregg Doud, Aziz Akhannouch said that the 2018-2019 agricultural season has started off with better prospects than the 2017-2018 season. In August, Rabat and Washington agreed on the terms for Morocco to import US poultry products. Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, said, “The Trump Administration continues to prioritize the opening of new markets for U.S. agricultural products. This new access to the Moroccan market is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports.” Morocco, in the meantime, is hoping to capitalize on the advanced technologies of US agriculture and the technical know-how of American farmers to further Morocco’s competitiveness. The long-term goal is to expand Morocco’s newfound continental role as an expert exporter in regional and continental markets, the Moroccan ministry suggested.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat- Mustapha Akiki, a radiologist from Casablanca, made history by being the first Moroccan winner of the competition held by France’s National College of Obstetric Gynecologists (CNGF). Akik won the competition with his presentation of a case study on the successful premature delivery of a seven-month old fetus thanks to ultrasound technology. Akiki competed with 200 other doctors for the competition in Paris on June 28. Akiki also founded the Gyno-Obstetric Ultrasound Circle (CEGO), a Moroccan NGO that gives gynecologists training in ultrasound imagery and makes sure the technology is available for use throughout Morocco. Ultrasound imagery is often used to monitor a mother and her baby during pregnancy so that doctors can address any issues or prepare for future problems that might occur during pregnancy. Akiki and his team have spent the past five years traveling throughout Morocco and hosting workshops focusing on interdisciplinary work related to embryology between gynecology and general practitioners in an effort to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates, according to Eljadida News.  In a recent interview with Le Matin, Akiki said, “A good ultrasound is a woman saved.” The work he has done so far has already seen dramatic success in reducing fatal pregnancies across the country. With growing international recognition and support, Akiki has increased the accessibility of ultrasounds for doctors nationwide.

Rabat – Trump appeared to be upset over President Macron’s sharp rebuke of rising nationalist sentiment, which Trump may have considered a personal attack on himself and his administration. The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!…….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 13 novembre 2018 
Macron gave a speech at a ceremony honoring the 100-year anniversary of the end of the first world war, saying, “Nationalism is a betrayal of Patriotism.”  The French president went on to state, “In saying, ‘Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,’ you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great, and that which is most important: Its moral values.” President Trump was also angered by critical press coverage for his decision not to attend a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice made by all nations involved in the war. Yesterday, Trump tweeted, “Macron suggests building his own army to protect Europe from the United States, China and Russia. But it was Germany in both World Wars – How did it go for France? They started learning German in Paris before the arrival of the United States. Pay for NATO or not!” Macron had argued that Europe should strengthen its military because it can no longer depend on the US for defence. Trump complains that the NATO countries, including France, are not paying their share of the defense alliance’s expenses. On Saturday, Trump and Macron met at the Elysée Palace to discuss issues such as defense and trade. Macron told Trump that France was not making a choice between a European defense strategy and multilateral organizations such as NATO.

Rabat – According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the majority of the members of the committee adopted a favorable opinion of the agriculture agreement. The committee’s views may reflect the “position of the political groups represented therein in favor of the adoption by the European Parliament of this agreement which aims at extending trade preferences to agricultural and fishing products from Morocco’s southern provinces.” In July, the European Union Foreign Affairs Council decided to include Western Sahara in the Association Agreement and the EU-Morocco agriculture deal. “This is a measure that is in line with the decision of the EU Court of Justice on the liberalization agreement of agricultural and other products issued on December 21, 2016, which is aimed at extending tariff presence” to the region, a source quoted by MAP said. The decision also encouraged the EU to continue to enhance partnership with Morocco and “lead the way on the fishing agreement between the two partners in the coming months,” the source added. The EU and Morocco also agreed to renew a fisheries deal, which expired on July 14. EU-Morocco fishery ties date back to 1995.  Before entering into effect, the deal must pass through the European Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states.

Rabat – The 2018 summit, under the theme “Africa, My Home: An Inclusive Participation for Africa’s Development,” will meet November 16-17 at Palais des Congres Rabat. The event will host civil, political, art, and media personalities as well as representatives of the public and private sectors and diplomatic missions. The summit’s activities “will focus on themes which form the main strategic vision of the 2030 UN Agenda and the African Union (AU) agenda 2063, including migration, gender, youth and women’s participation in development and peace as well as education, employment and climate change,” reads a press release by the Pan African summit. The summit will also focus on “African cultural identity and its contribution to socio-economic transformations in Africa, as well as the role of civil and civic diplomacy in promoting people-to-people relations and partnerships exchanges bilaterally and regionally.” After Morocco re-joined the AU in January 2017, the country took part for the first time in the 2017 Pan African Humanitarian Summit and Awards in Tanzania on November 18 last year. Morocco’s ambassador and country director to the Pan African Humanitarian Summit, Karima Rhanem, told Morocco World News, “Morocco was chosen for its global and regional commitments to just causes, it is a country that has shown solidarity, vision and leadership in promoting socio-economic development and cooperation in Africa.” At the 2017 Pan African Humanitarian Summit, Morocco took the chance to share its experience in human and socio-economic development with over 300 delegates.  Morocco’s leadership “has been clearly seen through several investments and efforts deployed by Morocco under the wise leadership of HM King Mohammed VI in the past few years to promote South South cooperation and to contribute to the development of the African continent,” she added. She noted that 85 percent of Morocco’s foreign direct investment goes to Africa. This makes Morocco the “number one investor in West Africa and the second largest investor in the African continent.” Morocco may have left the AU for three decades but it never left the African continent and “has ever since strengthened ties with several African countries on the bilateral level,” Rhanem affirmed. After the 2017 Pan African summit, the Moroccan International Center for Diplomacy signed a partnership agreement with the Nigerian-based Pan African Center for Leadership and Entrepreneurship Development to organize the fourth summit in Morocco. Rhanem said that the King regards Africa as “his natural home and deployed considerable efforts in strengthening partnerships with African countries.” “It is a beautiful day when one returns home after too long of an absence,” King Mohammed VI said at the AU summit in January 2017. King Mohammed VI has made over 52 visits to several African countries in the last 19 years.  Holding the summit in Morocco, according to Rhanem, shows “the Kingdom’s commitment towards regional and global issues and provides for an institutionalized platform for dialogue for civil society and other stakeholders.” Speaking about migration, Rhanem asserted that Morocco is “the only African country with a full integration policy for African migrants and refugees.” On November 7, Moroccan Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit said that 50,000 migrants residing in Morocco have been regularized since 2014. The number accounts for about 85 percent of the overall applications from foreign nationals in Morocco. The objective of the 2018 summit is to identify concrete African solutions on sustainable peace and social-economic development in Africa. Rhanem said that one of the main objectives of the summit is to “demonstrate HM the King’s leadership in Africa and his efforts in promoting South-South cooperation.” The event will also be an opportunity to exchange Morocco’s experience in human and economic development with other African countries. This year’s meeting seeks to “provide technical expertise to delegates on how to move Africa from consumption of international aid programs to a strong strategic economic and geopolitical partner,” according to the Pan African Summit’s press release. The Moroccan International Center for Diplomacy organized the two-day event in partnership with the Pan African Center for Leadership and Entrepreneurship Development (PALEDEC), the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation, and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. At the end of the summit, an award ceremony will pay tribute to African personalities who have developed Africa in various fields. Rhanem, who is also a civil society activist, won a 2017 Pan African Humanitarian Award. The activist was the first Moroccan woman to be nominated for the award, in the category of “Young Achievers Award on Social Leadership and Nation Building.” The summit will come one month before the UN Global Compact on Migration conference in Marrakech.

Speaking at the first African Road Safety Forum, in Marrakech on Tuesday, November 13, El Othmani said Morocco is mobilized to collaborate with African partners to address road safety challenges. Although Morocco has made progress, he said, the country wants to insure safer travel for its citizens. El Othmani said that Morocco is ready to share its experience in road safety. Transportation safety is an essential component of sustainable development and a real challenge for Africa. The head of government called improving road traffic safety a top priority for the government. He cited statistics that show that African nations have a high traffic death rate of around 26.6 per 100,000 persons per year compared to 6 per 100,000 in Europe. “Africa has to save its people from such disastrous results,” he said. On October 20, slab of the Mohammed VI Avenue bridge in Casablanca fell on a car, killing the vehicle’s passenger, a woman in her sixties.

Rabat – The pioneering German firm specializes in the supply of electrical systems, cables, and plastic components. The project, part of Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan, cost MAD 450 million. According to Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy, the project will offer 3,000 job opportunities. The company is expanding its presence across the world with over 40 sites and 48,000 employees. The North African country is aiming to exceed MAD  100 billion in car export sales by 2020. The Ministry of Industry wants to raise the bar to MAD 200 billion in exports with a production capacity of 1 million vehicles by 2025. Last year, Morocco established itself as a continental leader, surpassing South African car production with 345,000 passenger vehicles in 2017 over South Africa’s 331,000.

Un investissement de 450 millions de dirhams et 3 000 emplois directs pic.twitter.com/FFvWHzM8su — Moulay Hafid Elalamy (@MyHafidElalamy) November 13, 2018  Morocco has become a regional  and an international hub for the automotive industry with the establishment of several plants of global giants, such as Renault and Peugeot, in the automotive sector. With  a global gateway port (Tangier-Med), Morocco has convinced automotive firms to open plants in economic free zones in Tangier and Kenitra. Renault has more than 40 percent of the market share in the region with two assembly plants. Morocco also attracted investors to build plants making car parts, including Nexteer, Gestamp, Ficosa, and Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli. In September, Africa Intelligence said that Morocco is also keen to attract German giant automobile manufacturer Volkswagen. The news outlet said that the company “is putting the finishing touches to a business plan for the establishment of an assembly plant in the country.” Morocco’s acceleration initiative in the automotive sector aims to create 500,000 jobs, “half of which comes from foreign direct investment, and the other half from a renovated national industrial base,” according to the Ministry of Industry. It also aims to achieve a “nine point growth in [the automotive] industry’s share of GDP, increasing from 14% to 23% by 2020.”

By: Trista Youssef Rabat – General Abizaid is a top-ranking general who led the US Central Command from July 2003 to March 2007. He oversaw US activities in the Iraq war under former US President George W. Bush.  Abizaid currently serves as consultant and fellow at Stanford University.  Abizaid, who speaks fluent Arabic, is highly regarded by military and diplomatic veterans and known for his extensive experience in the Middle East.  Abizaid’s nomination comes at a time where US-Saudi relations are strained by the death of US resident Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national, who was brutally killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a Saudi hit squad.  Trump’s decision to appoint Abizaid shows the emphasis put on the military relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia in light of a multi-billion dollar arms deal in 2017. Although Trump claims “severe consequences” will face Saudi Arabia in light of Khashoggi’s death, he intends to keep the arms deal intact.  The ambassador position to Saudi Arabia has been vacant throughout Trump’s presidency. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner previously acted as a liaison to Saudi Arabia. He is cited as being in frequent phone communication with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and took an unscheduled trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017.  It is unclear whether Kushner will continue to be the main contact with the crown prince or if Abizaid will assume control over the US-Saudi communication channel.   Abizaid’s appointment has yet to be confirmed by the US Senate.

Rabat- In a meeting following a week of protests against GMT+1, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), headed by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, reiterated that it will not go back on its decision to stay on GMT+1 after Daylight Saving Time ended. Other members of the Parliament argued during the meeting that it was a “chaotic and rushed” decision, and it directly affects the people. While defending the decision, El Othmani recognized that his government kept the decision from the public until the last minute, which Moroccans considered a “surprise” move, reported Alyaoum24.   Morocco was set to end DST and return to standard time on Sunday, October 28. The government announced on October 26 that Morocco would add 60 minutes to standard time, effectively staying on DST. The government asserted it would “benefit” the public and save energy, which has caused widespread condemnation. Many criticized officials for not “taking public opinion into consideration.” Mohamed Benabdelkader, the Moroccan minister delegate in charge of administration reform, said Tuesday in the House of Councillors that staying on GMT+1 will depend on the benefits it brings to the country throughout wintertime from November to April 2019, which may be a testing period. Responding to a central question about the causes and reasons for the change in the legal time, Benabdelkader pointed out that the decree to stay on summer time is a “text of management” which is not definitive. He added that it aims to achieve stability and not to establish a new time zone for Morocco. Benabdelkader emphasized that the government’s decision to stay on GMT+1 was the result of a “thorough scientific” assessment conducted by the Administration and Public Service Reform and international experts under El Othmani’s supervision. Since Tuesday, November 6, hundreds of students across Morocco, in Fez, Meknes, Rabat, Sale, Casablanca, Beni Mellal, Khenifra, Errachidia, and the town of Kelaat Sraghna in central Morocco, skipped school and organized marches and sit-ins both to protest staying on GMT+1 and to call on the government to keep the traditional school timetable. The students’ protests, especially on Monday in Rabat near the Parliament, witnessed an air of “chaos.” Some students carried sharp weapons, threw stones at each other, and burned the national flag in public. Police arrested some of the students. According to Morocco’s penal code, insulting the emblem and symbols of the kingdom is punishable by imprisonment from six months to three years in addition to a fine of MAD 10,000 to 100,000. If the offense is committed in front of a group of people, the penalty increases to one to five years in prison. The offender may even lose his or her civil rights or be banned from entering the country, according to Article 40 of the penal code.

Rabat – Marrakech, which depends largely on French visitors, makes approximately 30.2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from tourism. The red city came second to Cancun, Mexico, a favorite American destination. Cancun receives 49.6 percent of its income and revenue from tourism and travel. For Macau, China, which came third, the figure is 29.3 percent of GDP. Marrakech’s economy is primarily based on tourism, commerce, and crafts. The luxury and boutique hotel experience has helped upgrade tourism infrastructure in the city. Maintaining good tourism infrastructure helped make the red city a favorite destination for tourists and celebrities and a venue for international events. According to the 2018 tourism statistics released by the Ministry of Tourism, 1.2 million tourists arrived through Marrakech’s Menara Airport between January and July. Licensed accommodation establishments recorded 4.7 billion overnight stays. King Mohammed VI launched construction, reconstruction, and restoration projects in 2017 to preserve the cultural and spiritual aspects of the medina in Marrakech as “A City of Permanent Renewal.” Other medinas in Morocco such as Fez, Casablanca, Rabat, and Sale have also benefited from similar projects.

Rabat – The finance committee voted on the first part of the 2019 finance draft bill by adopting 56 amendments and withdrawing 72 of 224 total amendments on Sunday, November 11. The amendments included raising domestic consumption taxes by 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks with high sugar levels, according to a statement released by the ministry delegate in charge of relations with the Parliament on Monday, November 12. Beginning January 1, 2019, “Soft drinks manufacturers, which used to pay MAD 30 per 100 liters, will [now] pay MAD 45,” while domestic taxes on nectar will increase from MAD 10 to 15 per 100 liters, reported the daily newspaper L’Economiste. For energy drinks such as Redbull, the domestic consumption tax will increase from MAD 500 to 600 per 100 liters. A VAT of MAD 70 per 100 liters will be applicable on sales of soft and non-carbonated drinks that contain 5 grams or more of sugar per 100 milliliters. The government expects to generate over MAD 313 million from domestic consumption taxes on soft drinks in 2019. Reducing effects of sugar on public health Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun approved the amendments, which received a unanimous vote on the tax increase. The move, according to the committee, aims to reduce the effects of sugar on public health. Over 2 million people in Morocco suffer from diabetes and elevated blood pressure. The government hopes the tax increase will reduce the costs of Morocco’s social protection funds, which currently allocate more than 50 percent of their budget to diabetes and chronic diseases. According to a study conducted by the High Commission for Planning, in 2016, about 10 million Moroccans were overweight, including 6 million women. The increased tax may make consumers reduce their consumption of soft drinks and juices and make manufacturers revise the sugar quantity they put in the drinks. Tax raised on shisha tobacco The approved amendments also included raising domestic consumption taxes on shisha tobacco by MAD 100 per kilogram. According to L’Economiste, the tax will increase from MAD 350 to MAD 450 per kilogram. The domestic consumption tax on certain cigarette brands will increase as well. The tax increase will affect the most widely-consumed cigarettes on the market: Marlboro and Marquise. Marlboro packs will be sold for MAD 40 instead of 33, and Marquise for MAD 21 instead of 19. According to Article 5 of the bill, the minimum tax rate will increase from MAD 567 to MAD 630 per 1,000 cigarettes, while the minimum tax burden will increase from 53.6 percent to 58 percent. The 56 adopted amendments also included VAT exemption on sales of “water pumps generated by solar and all renewable energies used in the agricultural sector.” VAT exemption will also be applicable on anti-meningitis drugs.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The violence, which erupted on Monday and stretched into Tuesday, was set off by a botched Israeli commando raid into Gaza on Sunday night which killed seven Palestinians, among them a Hamas commander. One Israeli soldier was also killed in the fighting. In response to the raid, Hamas, the group administering the Gaza strip, and other militant factions launched more than 400 projectiles mostly aimed at the southern Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Sderot, killing one and injuring 18 others. Israel retaliated with dozens of airstrikes aimed at military targets and other structures used by Hamas, damaging several homes in the process. Reports from inside Gaza also stated Israel target the buildings housing the Al-Aqsa television channel and Al-Amal Hotel.  Late Tuesday, Hamas leaders announced a ceasefire, and Israel soon followed suit. The sudden announcement sparked celebrations in Gaza. A joint statement by Palestinian groups in Gaza read, “Egypt’s efforts have been able to achieve a ceasefire between the resistance and the Zionist enemy. The resistance will respect this declaration as long as the Zionist enemy respects it. A right-wing member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government confirmed the rumors of Israel’s agreement to the ceasefire, although the member himself insisted he was against such an agreement. The announcement angered residents in Sderot who took to the streets in protest, lighting tire fires and chanting “Disgrace!” and, referring to Netanyahu’s nickname, “Bibi go home!” The fact that Israeli officials were reluctant to publicly state their decision demonstrates the balancing act the government has had to strike while attempting to reach a long-term agreement with Hamas, which Israel views as a terrorist group.  According to the Washington Post, “Analysts say that the two sides are not interested in another round of conflict but that both are grappling with internal pressure to show strength.” The outline of the deal, being brokered by Egypt and funded by Qatar, includes much needed economic relief for Gazans in exchange for Hamas clamping down on border demonstrations, which made international headlines earlier this year.

Rabat – Following rumors, PAM confirmed on November 11 that one of its members has been serving the interests of the Polisario Front. In the statement, PAM wrote that after investigations, the party learned that Said Bouchti, who joined PAM in 2015, had left Morocco months ago. The party added that Bouchti is no longer committed to the mission for which he was elected. “He has not been linked to the core principles of the PAM in the region of Guelmim Oued Noun since the end of 2015.” The party decided to “implement the procedure of immediate expulsion” for party members acting against PAM’s principles. PAM concluded the statement by commending the efforts of its elected members and activists in the region of Guelmim, an area south of Agadir, for their “maximum mobilization” to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. The party also praised its members for their “demonstrable efforts to defend the dignity of citizens of all territorial communes in the region and to strongly advocate the interests of the population and their right to basic services and development.” It is not the first time a public figure in Morocco decided to join the separatist group. In 2013, a journalist at Al Oula television channel, Mohammed Radi Elili, started to heavily criticize Morocco following tension between himself and the director of Morocco’s National Television channel (SNRT), Fatima El Baroudi. Ellili said he left SNRT due to “harassment suffered in Al Oula because of being Sahrawi.” In response to the allegation, Baroudi said the tension was caused by Ellili’s behaviors, writing his own headlines and reading them without permission on air. Ellili left Morocco and is working in a news outlet in France as a political refugee. He is also active in defending the Polisario Front and lobbying against Morocco’s territorial integrity on his social media.

Amsterdam  – Oral health is affected by diet, nutrition, tobacco use, knowledge on general health, and diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Bad oral health leads to cavities, tooth decay, bad breath, and gum diseases like periodontitis. Bad oral health is also associated with risks for Alzheimer’s and heart disease and systemic health problems. In a country where cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes account for 58 percent of the mortality rate, oral health needs to be discussed as a matter of public health. Lack of oral hygiene and consuming sugary products or sweet sodas lead to oral cavities. When left untreated, this may lead to tooth decay, missing teeth, and gingival diseases.  Periodontitis is an irreversible aggressive form of gum disease. Oral hygiene and the associated habits must be incorporated from a young age. It should become a routine, a personal tradition, that is then maintained throughout one’s life.  In Morocco, children in orphanages are at high risk for oral diseases. Children’s oral health practices are dependent on their parents. Low rates of toothbrush use are observed in studies of mothers and their children. In this instance, the mothers displayed very inefficient brushing techniques.  In Sale, a neighboring city to Rabat, the mothers’ own knowledge of the practice of dental hygiene was investigated and shown to be related to children’s oral hygiene. Good oral hygiene practices were associated with the mother’s educational level and the child’s health status.  The Moroccan Mother and Child units serve as a basis to offer counselling for mothers regarding general health. This could function as a resource for incorporating dental hygiene and oral health programs into public services. With regard to adolescents, a research group from the Department of Odontology at Mohammed V University in Rabat showed that of a study with 450 participants, 86 percent had at least one untreated dental cavities even though 82.3 percent of the study population had dental health covered by their insurance. This indicates that oral health is not only related to medical insurance, but possibly other factors.   Morocco has a high prevalence of periodontitis in young people. In 2016, a Moroccan study group concluded that the young Moroccan population is at high risk for developing aggressive periodontal disease. Therefore, it is plausible that, due to the nature of the disease, the same applies to older populations.  A Spanish oral health research group conducted a study on patients with periodontitis, wherein 62 percent had aggressive periodontitis and 14 percent had chronic periodontitis. The bacteria co-responsible for developing periodontitis was  present in 60 percent of a study population consisting of Moroccan adolescents.  It is assumed that Moroccans are more susceptible to periodontitis; biological elements such as genetics and the oral flora play a role in contributing to the increased risk. Likewise, a lack of proper oral hygiene, limited access to dental healthcare, the irregular use of toothbrushes and toothpaste in rural settings and low income families, and inadequate knowledge on significance of oral health factor into this widespread public health issue.

Rabat – In a statement published Tuesday, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) announced that party members will visit Algeria to find ways to “overcome all disagreements to prevent the development of different levels of cooperation” between the two countries. The statement did not announce when PJD will visit Algeria. The statement added that the PJD discussed the decision to send a delegation to Algeria during a regular meeting chaired by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on November 10. PJD also discussed the major points of King Mohammed VI’s speech for the Green March on November 6. In his speech, the King called Moroccan-Algerian diplomatic ties “not normal” and “much less than acceptable.” The King emphasized that the abnormal situation requires a “frank and a direct dialogue.”  The King also said that Morocco is “willing to consider the proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations. Algeria, however, has remained silent on Morocco’s offer. To date, Algeria has not issued any official statement on the King’s dialogue offer. But on November 10, Algerian news outlet TSA shared a statement from an “authorized source” speaking anonymously on the King’s dialogue initiative. The source said that the King’s offer is “questionable” and a “non-event that does not deserve a formal answer.” Unlike Algeria, many countries have shown support for Morocco’s dialogue offer, including the UAE, Qatar, France, Spain, and Jordan. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also backed Morocco’s dialogue initiative. On November 7, the Secretary-General’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said that Guterres “has always been very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco.”  Dujarric also said that Guterres “welcomes” the support of King Mohammed VI for the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who invited all parties for talks in Geneva December 5-6.

The agreement, effective November 13, offers passengers more choice and better connectivity between Spain and Morocco. It will allow both companies to increase their flight schedule between Casablanca and Madrid. The companies hope it will revive traffic between the two countries offering tourists, businessmen, and students more travel options and better schedules. Royal Air Maroc and Iberia now offer their customers 21 direct flights per week between Casablanca and Madrid. They offer 25 per week during peak periods. The flights are already available on the booking systems of both companies. The new code-sharing agreement may be extended over time to other cities and regions.

Rabat- The figure comes from the latest High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) report based on employment data from 2017.  According to the report, a number of factors increase the likelihood individuals have healthcare coverage: being female, living in a city, being 60 or older, and in a household headed by a male—or more importantly, by a person with a higher education degree. Women are slightly more likely (47.6 percent) to be covered by healthcare insurance than men (45.5 percent). Urban dwellers  are more likely (53 percent) to be insured than those in rural areas (35.5 percent).  Moroccans aged 60 and above also have much higher coverage rates (56.7 percent) than younger people, especially those aged 15-29 (37.1 percent) The healthcare coverage rate is 47.4 percent for Moroccan households managed by males and 41.1 for households headed by females. The rates vary the most drastically based on the educational levels of household heads. Households whose heads do not have a degree are far less likely (39.3 percent) to be covered than households whose heads have higher education degrees (78.2 percent). HCP indicates that 10.7 million people were employed in Morocco in 2017, and of these 4.6 million are covered with healthcare insurance. The government plans to cover 90 percent of the Moroccan population with health insurance by 2021. The current health system, the Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED), has been in place for six years, along with Compulsory Health Insurance (AMO). In May, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pledged to support Morocco’s ambition to extend health insurance to low-income and disadvantaged people.

By Mohamed Bella Rabat- On the edge of the historic Second Battle of the Aisne, near Reims in northeast France, the Art and Gardens Association of the Hauts-de-France region and the World War I Centennial Commission decided to create a garden to commemorate the war dead. The valley once ravaged by war was this year turned into an awe-inspiring garden to remember the Moroccan soldiers that died in France during World War I.  Moroccan Karim El Achak of the Marrakech National School of Architects designed the garden in collaboration with Belgian Bernard Depoorter of BDP Concept Agency in Lyon and Marrakech. The “piece of Morocco” on French soil is inspired by the Garden of the Hesperides. Hesperides was a mythical garden that once grew the golden apples of wisdom east of the Canary Islands and south of the Iberian peninsula. Many people believe it is located on a small hill between the town of Larache and Tangier. The new garden in France is punctuated by a simple metal basin set on a colorful mosaic platform. It evokes the Arab-Muslim garden design with a fountain in the center.  The Peace Gardens project settled 14 gardens of remembrance along with the Moroccan garden to commemorate the soldiers from all the nations affected by the war. The gardens are the work of artists and designers from the countries that once fought in Hauts-de-France, a region in northeast France. The Peace Gardens are created in the same places of conflict that witnessed bombings and killings throughout the course of the war. People from all ages and nationalities came together on Armistice Day, November 11, in Hauts-de-France to mourn and celebrate at the same time the sacrifices of those who served in World War I.

Rabat – The accident also injured three other miners, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Local authorities, including the royal gendarmerie and civil protection, went to the site to evacuate and transport the victims to Oujda’s University Hospital. Police have opened investigation into the incident. Although the miners’ deaths were the third fatalities from mining accidents in a week, Tuesday’s accident was the first to be officially announced by the state-run news agency. On Sunday, November 11, a 54-year-old miner died in an accident only four days after a young miner died on Wednesday, November 7. The 54-year-old miner died while he was attempting to extract coal waste.  Jerada has observed multiple miners’ deaths. On December 23, 2017, two informal miners were crushed while mining underground at an abandoned coal mine in Jerada. Another miner died while extracting coal from an illegal mine near Jerada when the walls of the mine collapsed and killed him on February 1, 2018. The death of miners caused a wave of protests to denounce social inequalities and unemployment. The protests also led to several arrests. A court handed down the first sentences for protesters on November 8. Nine people received three-five years in prison. The court charged the nine with “destruction of public property, incitement to commit crimes and offenses or participation in a non-violent demonstration,” their lawyer said in a statement to AFP. In 1998, the government closed Jerada’s coal mines. Due to a lack of economic opportunity, many workers in the town take risks to continue extracting resources from the mines. In two separate mine accidents, four informal miners died in December 2017 alone.

By Majid Morcelli The Algerian media may have been caught off guard and did not expect the King’s speech to proclaim peace towards Algeria. Algerian officials probably believed that the King’s speech would be business as usual defending Morocco’s territorial integrity and saying Algeria is doing its best to thwart any progress in the Sahara dossier. King Mohammed VI’s move was a smart one. If the Algerians accept his proposal for dialogue, Morocco and Algeria will move on to making peace and turning a new page. But if Algeria refuses, the King’s proposal will make it seem to the world that Algeria is the enemy of peace and an obstacle to a united Maghreb. When Morocco previously proposed a peace plan to Algeria, the Algerians responded immediately with their conditions in order to start dialogue with Morocco. This time, the Algerians did not officially respond to Morocco’s overture. Instead, an “authorized source” informed a news outlet of their refusal of the King’s proposal. Algeria is going through tough times. President Bouteflika has reportedly been incapacitated by a stroke, and there seems to be insider fighting in the El Moradia Palace. Army generals have been dismissed, possibly to prepare for Bouteflika’s successor, and no one knows what the near future will bring.  King Mohammed VI is a savvy politician, and he is very much aware of what is happening in Algeria. Perhaps his overture was a way to save Bouteflika by showing that he can still make deals, or perhaps he wanted to give Bouteflika an opportunity to make a lasting peace deal that North Africans will remember him for before he is out of office. But I do not believe the King’s proposal is a farce. I think it is genuine because it is not the first time that Morocco has asked Algeria to start a new beginning. The lack of response from El Moradia Palace may signal that Bouteflika is no longer in charge. That is unfortunate for the Algerian regime, because they are probably trying to show that their president is still calling the shots.   To be fair to the Algerians, it is simply not a good time to start any peace plan with Morocco. Algeria is likely too busy working out a plan to introduce Bouteflika’s successor. Algeria is not a democratic country. Everything is decided behind a closed door. Bouteflika himself was chosen by the military. Morocco will simply need to hope that whoever Bouteflika’s successor is, he will be interested in making peace with his neighbors. All signs so far indicate the contrary to me, but we should remain hopeful. Hope is all that we have.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent congratulations to Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Empress Michiko on the 28-year anniversary of Akihito’s ascension to the throne, according to the state-run news agency the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The King’s cable, sent Monday, praised the “friendship and mutual appreciation” between the two countries.  Since Japan’s formal recognition of Morocco in 1956, the two countries have had a positive relationship.  Japan and Morocco opened embassies in each other’s countries within the next ten years. Since then, Japan has often looked to Morocco as an important African partner both for trade and solving geopolitical issues in North Africa.  Since the 1990s, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has also invested in training for road maintenance, agricultural machinery improvement, micro fisheries development, port management, and maternal health care in Morocco. In late June both countries pledged to fight environmental problems in the Maghreb region by forming the “Morocco-Japan-Africa tripartite cooperation.” In addition, Japan has also invested over MAD 28 billion in loans for Moroccan economic growth and business development since the end of 2015. Japan was also a co-organizer alongside the UN, World Bank, and African Union Commission of the Tokyo International Conference  on African Development in Tokyo in October.

Rabat – The Social, Economic, and Environmental Council (CESE) is an independent consultancy body that conducts studies on socio-economic developments in Morocco. Prized by Moroccan decision makers, CESE’s studies and recommendations are generally commissioned by the Royal Palace or Moroccan parliamentary bodies. CESE’s secretary general, Driss Guerraoui, was speaking in Skhirat on Monday, November 12, at the plenary session of the first national conference on social protection. Social protection—assistance to vulnerable and low-income classes—and investment in quality education for a “frustrated and abandoned youth” should be an integral part of the development model, Guerraoui said. He asserted that investment in these two areas can strengthen social trust and help build a healthy rapport between citizens and their country. “Combating social exclusion fosters social peace.” As well as fostering inclusive growth and social trust—among citizens and between citizens and institutions—an effective policy framework on social protection and youth integration can lay the ground for social satisfaction, according to Guerraoui. Satisfied citizens and integrated youth, CESE’s secretary general elaborated, decreases grievances and establishes a peaceful social climate. Guerraoui’s Monday speech comes as Moroccan authorities realize the centrality of youth issues. From mass unemployment to widespread determination to immigrate to Europe, young Moroccans see no prospects of better life in their country. CESE’s reports have described Morocco’s youth as the left-behind of successive government actions. In August, CESE rang the alarm bell on Morocco’s disinterest in its young people. In a report that advocated for a “new national initiative to engage the youth,” the body argued that Moroccan youth are victims of repeated political failures. There is a staggering gap between policies and young people’s concerns, the report said. It explained that the perceived lack of job prospects and personal fulfillment opportunities often exposes Moroccan youth to “juvenile delinquency, suicide, drug addiction, and extremism.”

Rabat – The pope’s visit, announced Tuesday, will take in Rabat and Casablanca, two cities with Catholic congregations. The pope will spend two days in Morocco March 30-31 at the request of King Mohammed VI. The visit of the pope was expected in December to take part in the UN intergovernmental conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration in Marrakech December 10-11. “At the request of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and bishops, his holiness Pope Francis will visit Morocco for an Apostolic trip from March 30-31 2019. He will visit Rabat and Casablanca,” reads the Vatican’s statement. The visit will be the second of its kind from a pope to Morocco after the visit of John Paul II in 1985. King Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians. In March, King Mohammed VI sent a congratulatory message to Pope Francis, on the fifth anniversary of his papacy. The monarch expressed Morocco’s determination to continue to work with the pope on the consecration of the values of coexistence, communication, and dialogue between different people and civilizations. The King said that their mutual goal is to contribute to the construction of a better future to ensure the principles of harmony, peace, sustainability, and security.

On November 5, Lalonde presented her mission report on extending the EU-Morocco fisheries deal into the waters off of the southern provinces in the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee (INTA).  The report followed a visit by a delegation of three INTA committee members, Lalonde, Tiziana Beghin, and Heidi Hautala, to the southern provinces on September 3-4. The mission was in charge of evaluating the extension of EU-Morocco trade preferences to products from the region —mainly agricultural and fishery products.  In her draft report published on September 11, Lalonde wrote the European Parliament is “convinced” that local populations in the southern provinces will profit from economic development and “the spill-over effects created in terms of investment in infrastructure, health and education.” The MEP also recognized the economic, social, and environmental development “observed in Dakhla and Laayoune and the significant potential for further creation of both low- and high-skilled local employment opportunities.” Lalonde’s report stressed that the European Parliament should ensure a traceability mechanism to trace products from the region “so that Member States customs authorities have a clear indication of their origin.” The EU Commission, represented by MEP Sabine Henzler, assured MEPs that the commission is currently discussing the traceability issue with Morocco, reported Western Sahara Resource Watch. Henzler did not recognize Polisario’s role in the discussion over the fisheries agreement. She said that the fact that the UN considers Polisario as the political representative of Sahrawis does not mean Polisario could be considered as a trade representative. The MEP added that the commission has done “all that is possible and feasible” to get Sahrawis’ consent through a “consultation exercise,” reported the pro-Polisario outlet. All MEPs agreed that traceability should be made before the Parliament will expectedly vote on the proposal in January 2019, according to the same outlet. Polisario supporters opposed Lalonde’s report by sending a letter to the European parliamentarians calling for the suspension of the Parliament’s assessment of the proposed trade deal, according to pro-Polisario Western Sahara Resource Watch. “The conclusions included in the draft report of MEP Lalonde favouring the application of the EU-Morocco liberalization agreement have no basis, in the absence of a profound and thorough investigation,” the letter reads. The report, according to the letter, is biased because it favours Morocco and “disrespects [the] EU position of not recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory and undermines international law and UN peace efforts.”  The International Trade Committee will vote on Lalonde’s report on December 3. The new EU-Morocco fisheries deal was finalized on July 24, in Rabat, with Moroccan officials.  Instead of the €80 million that Rabat requested, the EU agreed to pay €52 million for fishing privileges. The amount is higher than the €42 million in the previous deal which expired on July 14.

Rabat- The first appeal hearing of journalist El Mahdaoui, sentenced to three years in prison for failing to report “an attempt to undermine internal state security” to the national police, did not go smoothly. El Mahdaoui and his defense protested the judge’s “biased” approach in leading the hearing, complaining that the judge listened fully to the attorney general’s arguments but interrupted the appellant’s team.  The dispute metamorphosed into shouts when the attorney-general denied that he had previously told El Mahdaoui: “Moroccans are with you.” “I swear to God you said that to me,” El Mahdaoui insisted before the judge dismissed him from the court, adjourning the hearing. The public prosecutor condemned protests inside the court, stressing that the “decisions of the court must be respected by everyone.” He added: “An independent judiciary does not rule under the pressure of shouts and protests.”  The court postponed the hearing to December 3, 2018, for the defense to have more time to prepare. El Mahdaoui’s lawyers, including Mohammed Aghnaj, who is representing Hirak activist Nasser Zefzafi appealing his 20-year sentence, requested El Mahdaoui’s temporary release.  Asmaa Al Wadii, El Mahdaoui’s other lawyer, argued, “The right to freedom follows the right to life,” and “One may only know the value of freedom when imprisoned,” reported Moroccan news outlet Hespress. Police arrested El Mahdaoui, the founder of news outlet “Badil,” on July 20, 2017, for giving a speech at Place Mohammed VI in Al Hoceima encouraging people to join an “unauthorized” Hirak protest. The court also ruled that El Mahdaoui should pay a fine of MAD 3,000. The journalist said in the speech: “The continuous detention of activists is an aggression against us … the state might be strong but we are stronger with the fact that our cause is just.” Commenting on El Mahdaoui’s choice of words at the time, the public prosecutor stated that it was “incompatible with journalism as a profession dealing with collecting information and facts or investigating about them in a professional way in order to write or make media material.” In June, El Mahdaoui was among 54 activists and journalists sentenced from 1 to 20 years. Leaders of the protests, including Nasser Zefzafi, Nabil Ahamjik, and Ouassim Boustati, received 20 years.

The sentencing of journalists and activists sparked outrage across the country and made international headlines, leading to a series of protests calling for the release of the Hirak detainees. Several journalists, celebrities, NGOs, politicians, and activists took to their social media accounts to condemn the court’s ruling. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in the northern Rif region.

Rabat – While the number is a decrease from 2017, it represents a slight increase from November 2015 (MAD 220.8 billion) and a larger increase from November 2014 (MAD 168.25 billion) During the week of November 1-7, Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, injected MAD 72.3 billion into the economy. The interbank interest rate is currently 2.29 percent, Bank Al-Maghrib reported in a press release. Many European markets have negative interbank rates, according to Trading Economics. In contrast, countries such as the US, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia have rates between 2.62 and 2.73. During the same period, the dirham appreciated by 1.13 percent against the US dollar and depreciated by 0.19 percent against the euro.

Rabat – Bulgaria announced on Monday, November 12, that it would not sign the compact. As the country is facing a surging tide of protests and popular uprisings demanding affordable commodity prices and improved living conditions, Bulgaria’s announcement was hardly surprising. Saying migration worsens Europe’s crises has become the dish du jour in many European circles. But Bulgaria is hardly a one-off. Hungary, with a notoriously right-wing and anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orban, had already declared its opposition to the Global Compact’s agenda. Poland and the Czech Republic are also no fans of the compact, which, like Hungary’s Orban, they accuse of blurring the lines between legal and illegal immigration. But while Poland is yet to confirm its position, Czech authorities have already announced that they are considering not signing the final document. Croatia is also preparing to jump on the bandwagon of Eastern Europe’s reluctance to embrace migration. A hot-button topic in Europe, migration has become one of the few areas where European leaders have consistently failed to devise a common policy architecture. Clashes between Brussels and member states or among individual member states over national quotas for asylum seekers have become a wide currency in Europe’s troubled political waters. The latest clashes between Italy and France (over France’s decision to return irregular migrants to Italy) and Italy and England (over taking in migrants onboard the Aquarius rescue ship) also fit the narrative of Europe’s uneasiness with the flow of irregular migrants.
Euro-African partnership In the meantime, there are some voices calling for a new partnership model between Europe and Africa. They argue that the exclusive nationalism espoused by European right-leaning parties and the ensuing anti-migrant rhetoric are not the way forward for Europe. To salvage the European project, Europe needs to build bridges, rather than walls, with other parts of the world. Andre Flahaut, Belgium’s minister of budget and civil service minister, recently told Morocco World News that Europe should engage the non-European world to devise common ways of facing common challenges. The Belgian politician argued that respect for each other’s humanity should be the founding pillar of a new—and necessary—partnership between Europe and Africa. Udo Bullman, leader of the Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) in the European Parliament, said that, for Europe to come to terms with the rising tide of crises, ignoring Africa would be akin to “political suicide.” Meanwhile, the not-so encouraging stories about irregular migration—persisting intra-European clashes over national quotas of asylum seekers—suggest that there many be more reticent countries by the time representatives convene in Marrakech, Morocco, to ratify the Global Compact. What is the Global Compact? Adopted by the UN General Assembly on July 13, the Global Compact is the equivalent of a UN declaration on migration. The 34-page document calls for an effective multilateralism to solve a global issue as complex as intra and intercontinental human mobility. It advocates for an “enhanced cooperation on international migration in all its dimensions, have adopted this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.” In its desire to “make migration work for all,” the compact called on world governments to acknowledge “that no State can address migration alone, and upholds the sovereignty of States and their obligations under international law.” However, the US, which withdrew from the compact at the outset, said that the document encourages illegal migration and that it blurs the lines between different types of migrants. Proponents have slammed the criticism, however. Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, who called the compact’s adoption “a historic day for multilateralism,” said that the document signaled “realism, global vision, and shared responsibility” with regards to the global migration crisis. “Those countries that decided they are leaving the UN migration compact, had they read it, they would not have done it,” said Jean-Claude Junker, president of the European Commission.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a Saudi security officer who frequently traveled with the crown prince prior to his role in Khashoggi’s murder and one of a 15-man hit squad, made the call shortly after Khashoggi was strangled to death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.  In the Turkish recording of the call, Mutreb is heard instructing his superior over the phone to “tell your boss” the mission had been accomplished. Turkish officials told their US counterparts they think Mutreb was calling one of MBS’s aides back in Saudi Arabia. The New York Times reported that three people familiar with the contents of the recording said it did not specifically mention the crown prince by name, although US intelligence officials believe “your boss” most likely refers to MBS. Turkey shared the recording with CIA director Gina Haspel last month, when she visited Turkey to gather evidence about the journalist’s murder. Although a Saudi citizen, Khashoggi resided in the US at the time of his death.  Another part of the recording revealed that Khashoggi was quickly strangled after entering the consulate and dismembered with a bonesaw. Investigators have still not found his remains.  While Mutreb made the call in Arabic, and translations may differ, Mutreb reportedly said, “The deed was done.” In a statement released after the Times report, a Saudi official said Turkey had allowed them to listen to the audio, and “At no moment was there any reference to the mentioned phrase in the recordings.” On Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated he had shared the recording with Saudi Arabia, the US, France, and other Western allies. However, on Monday, French officials stated they had no such recording in their possession. “If the Turkish President has information to give to us, he must give it to us,” said French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Le Drian added that Erdogan risked turning the case into a “political game.”  Evidence implicating MBS in the death of Khashoggi is certain to intensify pressure on President Trump’s administration, who have viewed the crown prince as an invaluable ally in shaping the White House’s foreign policy goals in the Middle East.  Trump himself has suggested even more information coming out about the case could alter his views. He sayid last Wednesday, “I’ll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week.”  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call with MBS last week, stated, “The United States will hold all those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable.”

Baddou, who has also been the director general of the Moroccan Federation of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (FMSAR) since 2010, was re-elected at GFIA’s general meeting in Luxembourg on November 8. The two-year term will be Baddou’s second representing Africa and the Middle East within the executive committee of GFIA. In addition to Baddou, the committee has four representatives: Don Forgeon from Canada, Michaela Koller from Insurance Europe (representing all European federations), Toyonari Sasaki from Japan, and Tim Grafton from New Zealand. The Mexican market representative, Recaredo Arias, will now chair the executive committee. Baddou is the director of the Transport Insurance Company (CAT) and former president of the African Insurance Organization (OAA). He was both the first and only African and Arab representative to join GFIA’s executive committee in November 2016. Baddou’s re-election is a national and regional achievement, which demonstrates Baddou’s effective work with GFIA. Established in October 9, 2012, the GFIA represents national and regional insurance associations with various organizations, such as national governments and international regulators.  GFIA currently has associations and federations from 61 member countries, representing 87 percent of the annual insurance premiums issued worldwide.

Rabat-  In a statement, Morocco’s Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs announced that as the 1st of Rabi Al Awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar fell on November 9, Eid Al Mawlid celebrated by Sunni Muslims on the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal, will be on November 20. Morocco observed the crescent moon indicating the start of Rabi Al Awwal in the evening of November 8 coinciding with the second Hijri month Safar 29, 1440 AH.  While Sunni Muslims observe the birthday of Prophet Muhammad in the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal, Shia Muslims celebrate it on the 17th of the same month, falling this year on November 25. Unlike Eid al-Fitr marking the end of Ramadan or Eid al-Adha (the festival of sacrifice), for Eid Al Mawlid there are no special Eid prayers which Muslims perform early in the early morning of Eid. Although Eid Al Mawlid has frequently been a subject of debate in the Islamic world on whether Muslims are allowed to celebrate it or not since many Muslim scholars consider birthdays “haram” (forbidden), many Moroccans see it as an occasion to express their devotion to their faith and love for their prophet. Eid Al Mawlid Nabawi is a spiritual day when Muslims recall the ideals of Islam and recite poems dedicated to the prophet.

Rabat – Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported on Monday that the suspects arrested in Ait Meloul and Inezgane were also plotting terror attacks against high-level police officers, especially those who work with Morocco’s anti-terror squad who might arrest their accomplices in similar operations. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the suspects on Friday, November 9. According to the newspaper, the suspects were plotting serious terror attacks across Morocco, mainly targeting Jemaa El-Fna and other tourism hubs. The suspects had created a union of radicalized suspects, including two members of a terror group arrested in July in Fez and Safi. The suspects and the previously arrested members were allegedly coordinating to obtain weapons to commit terror attacks on sensitive locations across the country. The suspects, one of whom was already arrested on terrorism-related charges, also had links with ISIS outside the country to learn how to make explosive devices. Morocco has dismantled 183 terror cells since 2002. Fifty-one out of the 57 cells dismantled since 2015 were allegedly connected with ISIS.

Rabat- The feature film, “Sofia,” produced by Moroccan director Meryem Ben M’barek, won three awards on Saturday at the Opera Theater in Tunis, including the TV5 Monde Prize and the Tahar Cheriaa Award, so named for founder of the Carthage Film Festival.  In addition to “Sofia,” two other Moroccan films won awards in the feature film category: Mohcine Basr’s “Laaziza” and Hind Bensari’s “We Could Be Heroes.” The jury praised the quality of the movie “Sofia” and stressed the significance of its subject and plot. Ben M’Barek’s Sofia follows the story of a single mother, who is desperately searching for the father of her unborn child to avoid being reported to the authorities by the hospital. The film aims to depict “the pressure imposed by a society that cannot comprehend a birth without a husband,” Ben M’Barek explained in a previous statement. In addition to awards at the Carthage Film Festival, “Sofia,” which was released in French cinemas on September 5, received the Best Screenplay Award at the Cannes Film Festival in May. “Sofia” is Ben M’Barek’s first feature film; however, her short film “Jennah,” which was her thesis project at the Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion (INSAS) in Brussels, won the 2014 Grand Prize at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. Other films representing Tunisia, the U.S., Brazil, Lebanon, Guinea, and Palestine were screened at the festival.  The Carthage Film Festival is considered a platform that unites African cinema  with Arab cinema. Established in 1966 by the late Tunisian film critic Tahar Cheriaa, the festival has been held in Tunis annually since 2014. Moroccan cinema continues to gain notoriety on the international stage, as evidenced by Noureddine Lakhmari’s nomination for best feature film for “Burnout” at the 2018 Brussels International Film Festival (FIFB). “Burnout” is the third and final film in a trilogy that began with “Casanegra” and “Zero.”  The fourth annual festival will be held from November 18 to 23.

Rabat – That optimistic sentiment was the conclusion of MEDays 2018’s only panel on art and design in Africa. The panel featured go-to names in the Moroccan artistic landscape, such as Hicham Lahlou, a leading Moroccan designer; and Nourredine Ayouch, a household name in the Moroccan and African world of media and art. The other two panelists were Kwame Kwel Armah, the UK-based artistic director of the Word Festival of Black Art, and Hampate Bah Roukiatou, president of the Amadou Hampate Bah foundation. Together, they discussed how coordinated African policies to disseminate and popularize African art can shape the way forward for Africa on the global stage. Even if art cannot literally end the numerous crises that the African continent is facing today, it does provide an opportunity of self-expression for many Africans striving for meaning and socio-economic prosperity. “As it breaks barriers and fosters communication, art can bring our continent together,” said an optimistic Hicham Lahlou. Speaking about the role design and art can play in realizing African unity, the Moroccan designer extolled the unifying virtues of artistic creation. “Being a designer or an artist is not only about working alone in your corner of the table,” he said. As well as adding beauty and color to ordinary things, the work of the artist or a designer adds meaning to individual’s lives. A design or a song often is the reflection of the soul and identity of a whole people. But besides these traditional roles associated with artistic endeavor, art does practically contribute to economic development. Lahlou explained: “I was recently reading an article in Les Echos—a leading French magazine on economy-related matters—and I remember the article’s author saying that the art industry contributes six times more to [France’s] GDP than the automobile sector.” An avowed lover of colors and sounds, the Moroccan designer explained how Africa’s colorful creativity stems first and foremost from its uniquely diverse linguistic landscape. With an estimated 2,200 languages spoken across Africa, the continent can pride itself in being a repository of boundless creative potential. In fact, the Moroccan offered, “There is already a lot to be proud of in Africa. There is so much going on. So many talents both established and emerging. All that remains is to promote them, give them platforms to express themselves and contribute to the rise of the continent. Africa is not the future; now is the time for Africa.” In a burst of validations, other panelists resoundingly agreed with Lahlou. Though in different tones, reflective of their backgrounds, they all argued that “a society’s artistic creation plays a key role in how its people are perceived by outsiders.” Investing in African pride According to Hampate Bah, a crucial challenge of contemporary Africa is to “reclaim our sense of being in the world and wash away the inferiority complex” associated with being from Africa. “We need to be proud of our intangible heritage,” she asserted. For his part, Ayouch put a strong emphasis on the importance of communication in bringing Africa’s creative talents to the global stage.
“Without communication, even the greatest talent can easily fade away, unknown and unexploited.” He explained that African governments and businessmen should invest more in nurturing the many unexplored talents on the continent, giving them space to produce beauty and alter how Africa is perceived by others. Kwame Kwel Armah, the panel’s last speaker, echoed the same belief in art’s transformative powers, though in more philosophical language.
“Disruption,” he began, referring to MEDays’ 2018 theme—In the Age of Disruption: Finding the New Paradigms—“does not require new tools.” To disrupt all you need is to know the tools at your disposal, he asserted. The suggestion, as he went on to articulate, is that only by internalizing and espousing the “African spirit” can the African continent rise to the challenges facing its countries and people. Calling for a demystification of European universality, the UK-based artist and drama director spoke extensively of “how the way we think about our art can usurp the notion of European superiority.”

Rabat – British news outlet the Telegraph confirmed the news Monday morning.  Public Health England (PHE) released a statement warning travellers to avoid contact with animals when travelling to rabies-affected countries. The statement from PHE said that “there is no risk to the wider public in relation to this case but, as a precautionary measure, health workers and close contacts are being assessed and offered vaccination when necessary.” PHE also included information about how rabies is spread, emphasizing that people can be affected through injuries such as bites and scratches from an animal with rabies. “This is an important reminder of the precautions people should take when travelling to countries where rabies is present. If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal you must wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay, the statement quoted the head of Immunisations at PHE Mary Ramsay as saying. The statement added rabies is common in several parts of the world, especially in Asia and Africa. The infectious disease can be found in dogs, cats, and other mammals. In Morocco, the number of people who contracted rabies moved from 43 in 1985 to 15 in 2017.  If there is a suspicion of rabies, the patient should get a rabies vaccination as soon as possible after an animal bite to prevent infection.  The injury should be also washed for at least five minutes with soap, water and detergent.

Rabat – Moulay Hicham shared a statement on Twitter in which he criticized the sentence given by Casablanca’s Court of Appeal on Friday night. Bouachrine received a sentence of 12 years in prison. “We are deeply saddened about the absence of a fair trial in the case of journalist Taoufik Bouachrine,” the prince said. He added that the lack of a “fair trial “missed an opportunity to establish truth in a judicial case that was mainly intended to protect Moroccan women.”
 Bouachrine was arrested in February after several women journalists filed complaints against him for “sexual harassment, assault, human trafficking, attempted rape, and  rape.”
 Prince Moulay Hicham said that the absence of a fair trial in this case and the lack of “testimony [by] national and international human rights organizations, which are known for their credibility, lead automatically to the conclusion that there are national and Arab political motives behind the prosecution of a journalist, who was a nuisance because of his writings.”
 The prince also questioned press freedom in the country, saying that the target, in this case, is “freedom of expression and independent press.” For  Moulay Hicham, Bouachrine’s case is “a new episode of an ongoing series” wherein we witness the “targeting [of] news outlets and journalists.” He added that some of those journalists who were jailed or exiled include Abou Baker El Jamii, Ali El Merabet, Ali Anzoula, Hamid El Mahdaoui, and others. Moulay Hicham also criticized Morocco’s development model. He said that the recent cases come against the backdrop of the state’s admission that its development model has “failed.” “with the state acknowledgment of its failed development model.”

Rabat – Recent reports have indicated diplomatic “normalization” between Israel and a number of Arab countries, especially the Gulf States. In a speech on Saturday, Hezbollah’s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah fumed at the growing diplomatic gains. Brandishing the Palestinian cause as a diplomatic red line, Nasrallah said that befriending Israel is a betrayal of the people of Palestine. “We condemn any normalization with the Zionist entity,” Nasrallah said. He added: “The current normalization has put an end to Arab hypocrisy, and removed the mask from the swindlers and hypocrites.”  Israel’s rejoinder was quick to come. Speaking on behalf of the Israeli government on Sunday, Regrev slammed the leader of Hezbollah, promising that “Israel will continue normalization with the Arab World.” “To the terrorist Nasrallah: I heard the things you said yesterday about the prime minister and myself and the hospitality we received in the Gulf States. I saw how painful it is for you that there is someone in the Arab world who embraces us and desires us,” Regev retorted.  She continued: “We will continue to visit the Arab countries and aspire to peace as the Jewish people have always aspired to…. We will continue to extend a hand to peace and you will continue to threaten the State of Israel and its citizens and engage in terror.” In late October, Negrev was spotted at the Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed grand mosque wearing traditional Emirati garments. The Israeli official, who accompanied her country’s judo team at the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam, was extended an official visit by officials in the United Arab Emirate in order to tour the country’s largest mosque, which is also the world’s third-largest mosque.  Negrev said that during her trip to Abu Dhabi, the hospitality and the warmth that characterized her stay signaled a new chapter in Israel’s relations with the Arab World. “I am happy that I was privileged to be the first senior official from Israel to sign the mosque’s guest book,” she said on Facebook. She called her tour of the mosque a  “dream come true” and the beginning of dawn of a new era for Israel’s diplomatic push in the Arab world. Meanwhile, many in the Arab world have expressed discontent with news of normalization between the state of Israel and fellow “Arab brothers.” In his closing speech at the MEDays forum on November 10, Saeb Erakat, chief negotiator and secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, received a standing ovation when he remarked that there is no normalization with Israel until its forces liberate the “occupied Palestinian territories.” According to Erakat, Palestinians are today living under conditions that are “worse than the darkest hours of apartheid in South Africa.”

Rabat – Two weeks ago, Morocco announced that the country would be staying on GMT+1 time year-round instead of reverting back to GMT.  The move, announced two days before the scheduled change, was widely criticized for not allowing citizens and companies enough time to adjust. In the decree, the government said the new rule was “to avoid many changes that occur many times during the year and repercussions at many levels.” It also indicated that the permanent DST will be adopted as “an experiment.”  The Ministry of National Education said that protests against the new school hours were “isolated cases.” In Rabat, some protestors gathered in front of parliament; reports from Casablanca say students occupied the stairwells of the Twin Center. Last Friday, the Ministry of Education issued a memo to schools nationwide, encouraging them to adapt the new school hours. Normally, schools begin at 8 AM and end at 6 PM, allowing two hours for lunch.  With the new hours, students in urban areas begin at 9 AM, end at 5 PM, and have a two hour lunch break, while schools in rural areas begin at 9 AM, end at 3 PM, and only allot 30 minutes for lunch.

Rabat – Bourita told the press on Sunday at the forum that the main global challenges are peace, international security, climate change, and the fight against terrorism and migration. The minister said that Morocco is also very active at the international level combatting challenges, recalling that Morocco hosted COP22 in 2016 and other international symposiums. The official said that Morocco also has clear national policies to tackle immigration, terrorism, and climate change. “Morocco takes part in this forum in the framework of the vision of King Mohammed VI, which is marked by a direct correlation between stability on one side and development on the other,” Bourita said. The minister also spoke about Moroccan soldiers contributing to peacekeeping in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). Morocco is one of the many countries that contributed peacekeepers to help bring stability in the conflict-stricken African nation. Since it was established in 2014, MINUSCA has deployed over 12,000 troops to the country to protect civilians, following concerns over CAR’s security, human rights, and political crisis. Bourita said that since the creation of the UN, Morocco has sent more than 60,000 soldiers on peacekeeping operations in 17 operations around the world. The minister added that the North African country has nearly 2,000 soldiers serving under the aegis of the UN to preserve peace and security. The opening of the forum marked the Armistice Day commemoration in Paris on Sunday, November 11. King Mohammed VI and Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan attended the ceremony along with other world leaders. The event was organized to pay tribute to soldiers, including Moroccan combatants, who died in World War I.

Rabat – Mahamat also reaffirmed the AU’s support for any initiative to promote the revival of regional cooperation. “The President of the Commission has welcomed the will expressed by the King of Morocco, and reaffirmed the support of the African Union for any initiative likely to promote the revival of regional cooperation,” said Mahamat’s statement in response to King Mohammed VI’s Royal Speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. In his speech to the nation, the sovereign said that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with Algeria and proposed the setting up of a joint political mechanism for dialogue and consultation in order to settle the differences impeding the development of bilateral relations between the two countries. Morocco and Algeria share the world’s longest closed land border, and relations have suffered from their differing positions on the Western Sahara conflict. Several Arab, African, and European countries have commended the royal initiative to open new perspectives for peace, stability, and development in the Maghreb.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The move comes amid continued bipartisan anger by US lawmakers over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in early October, which has also increased scrutiny over American support of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s bloody civil war. Both the Saudi announcement, which came from the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Saturday, and US comments suggested Riyadh was the initial force that led to the decision. The Saudi-led coalition has been an active participant in the Yemen conflict since March 2015, when Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), who was Riyadh’s defence minister at the time, announced military action. The Saudi coalition intervened to fight the Houthi rebels on behalf of the internationally-recognized government of Yemen. Both the Saudis and US intelligence say the Houthi rebels are backed by the Iranian government, a claim which Tehran denies. The US and other Western nations have supported the coalition through the duration of the war with intelligence and logistical support, in-flight refueling, and billions of dollars in weapon sales.  In a statement, US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said he supported the Saudi decision to end US refueling support, adding “The U.S. will also continue working with the coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.” Although human rights organizations and aid workers applauded the decision, there are doubts weather it will have a significant impact on Saudi Arabia’s ability to conduct airstrikes. It is reported that before the announcement Riyadh was already refueling its own aircraft 80 percent of the time.  American support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen has long been controversial due to the high number of civilian casualties the airstrikes have caused, with the UN estimating at least 10,000 civilians dead. Other reputable organizations have placed the tally as high as 56,000. Coalition airstrikes have hit hospitals, wedding parties, health clinics and funerals among other non-military targets. Last August one such strike killed more than 40 schoolchildren on a bus, the bomb was US made. “After each airstrike, Yemenis often blame the United States in the same breath as the Saudi-led coalition for the tragedies.” In addition to the airstrike campaign, the Saudis have led an air, land, and sea blockade of Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, which has been ongoing since 2015. The blockade has had a devastating effect on Yemeni civilians, with the UN reporting 14 million people, more than half the country’s population, was at risk of famine, along with dangerous outbreaks of diseases such as cholera. In October Mattis announced the US would participate in peace talks between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition in Sweden later this year, which would be sponsored by the UN as well. Previous negotiation attempts, spearheaded by the UN special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths, between the two sides fell through last September, when the Houthis backed out claiming they had not been guaranteed safe return.

Rabat- The new season will feature two operators, an attacker and a defender from Morocco and a new fortress map. The fortress will be a military training center set in the Atlas Mountains. The map will allow players to test their skills inside a mud brick kasbah, an architectural structure that originated in southern Morocco. The multiplayer map will reportedly be based on Dar al-Makhzen, the Royal Palace of Rabat and official residence of the King of Morocco. The producers announced the game’s third year of post-launch content with a tweet that says “Welcome to Morocco” in Arabic. The full unveiling of Operation Wind Bastion’s content will be presented on November 18 at the Rainbow Six Pro League Finals in Rio de Janeiro. The release date is not yet known, but it is expected to be tested on the technical test server and published in late November or early December. Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege is the latest episode of the first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal studio.

Rabat- The King’s call seeks to end the stalemate between the two countries and revive mutual relations built on solidarity and trust. Safadi said that dispute settlement is a common Arab interest, helping to strengthen common Arab efforts and remove the challenges facing the Arab nation, according to Jordanian news agency Petra. The minister also stressed the two countries’ central role in harmonizing Arab positions on issues of common interest, adding that rapprochement would have a positive impact on bilateral relations, as indicated in King Mohammed VI’s royal speech for the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. Relations between Algeria and Morocco have deteriorated due to differences over Western Sahara, and even more so during the Algerian civil war in the 1990s. The countries’ land border, closed in 1994, is the world’s longest closed land border today.

With this notable achievement, the young adventurer is believed to have set a world record by “becoming the youngest person to climb the highest mountain in North Africa,” reported Irish Mirror on Monday, November 12. Davison scaled the 4,167-meter peak of Mount Toubkal with his mother Lyndsey and an an experienced mountaineer. “At over 3,000m we could already feel the altitude but we set off for the summit at 7am the following morning,” Davison’s mother Lyndsey said. The adventure was more challenging because of thick snow falling during the exciting trip. “We wore crampons on our feet as most of the route to the summit was over a steep, icy slope of up to 40 degrees,” Lyndsey added. The hike took more than two days. The first day involved “a testing four-hour trek to a mountain refuge where they spent the night.” Mount Toubkal is a popular destination for hikers, adventure-seekers, and mountain climbers from around the world. When the group reached the Toubkal summit after six hours of climbing on the second day, they experienced an “enormous sense of achievement,” according to Irish Mirror. The low oxygen level, which drops to only 12.4 percent at the summits made it an arduous task. However, the group was “determined and pushed on steadily to the summit.” Davison was so excited that he walked quickly on the way back down. “We descended in six hours and I had to keep asking Joshua to slow down so I could keep up,” Lyndsey said. The adventure-loving kid is from Killarney in Kerry, a county in southwestern Ireland. Davison’s family is submitting the details of their journey to be included in the Guinness Book Of Records. Joshua has gone back to his school at St Oliver’s National School, Killarney, where he is probably sharing his exciting adventure with his classmates. The six-year-old was already the youngest person to climb Ireland’s highest peak, Carrauntoohil, at 1,038 metres,  according to Irish Mirror. Next year, Davison hopes to climb the 5,895-meters-high Kilimanjaro Mountain in northeast Tanzania. He wants to set another record for being the youngest person to summit Kilimanjaro to raise funds for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Irish outlet added.

Rabat – “Cooperating with Africa is Europe’s last hope of finding effective solutions to the continent’s permanent crises,” said Andre Flahaut, Belgium’s minister of budget and civil service. Flahaut made the comment on November 10 at the 11th MEDays forum in Tangier, November 7-10. This year’s MEDays event brought together analysts, academics, journalists, and decision makers to discuss and devise a new path to disrupt the current state of affairs. Speaking at a panel on the conception of new paradigms to salvage the dying European dream of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Europe, the Belgian official said that neglecting lives and political developments in the Global South is one reason the developed world is now struggling with an ever increasing set of crises. “Europe’s repeated political failures to heed the non-Western world are catching up with the continent,” he argued.
Speaking to Morocco World News at the forum, Flahaut doubled down on his rhetoric. “Europe has been neglecting North-South cooperation,” he said. The neglect reached a point where Europe misleadingly believed that its high level of development immunized it from the crises and socio-political turmoil in other parts of the world. And instead of thinking that a series of high-profile meetings in Brussels will salvage the European project, he said, “What Europe needs today is to engage with the South, especially Africa.” But what if Africa does not rush to Europe should the latter extend a helping hand? What about the permanent weight of colonial history and Europe’s interventionist foreign policies? “That is exactly the point. When I say engage with Africa, I mean genuine and sincere cooperation. I don’t mean Europe’s traditional inclination towards neocolonialism and paternalism when dealing with countries in the South. I meant partnership. Being partners with someone means being respectful of each other’s potential and listening to each other to move forward together.” According to Flahaut, true partnership between Europe and the southern hemisphere would also entail a comprehensive Marshall Plan to “help these countries create employment opportunities and other resources to contain or avoid crises.” In contrast to traditional Marshall Plans, however, Flahaut said that the one he is advocating would “include a human resources aspect, such as education and technical cooperation.” Of Europe’s hardened stance on stemming the flow of irregular migration, he argued that the prevailing closed-borders policy is not the solution. “But I’m not saying that Europe should open its borders to everyone. The crisis [migration] is much more complex than that. So what is needed is a concerted solution where Europe cooperates with others to find a mid-way solution. We should never downplay the human dimension of a crisis.”

Rabat- Photos of the newly completed train station has been circulating online today.      On the request of King Mohammed VI, French President Emmanuel Macron will attend the inauguration of the LGV on Thursday, November 15 . After a series of delays, the train, which was set to be finished in 2015, and later delayed to 2017, is finally finished. Morocco’s 200-kilometer long LGV is the first of its kind in Africa, linking Casablanca and Tangier in two hours and 15 minutes instead of the usual 5 hour train ride. Several French companies collaborated in the construction and furnishing of the LGV, including SNCF, Alstom, Cegelec, and Ansaldo-Ineo. The cooperation has led international media to describe the LGV a “flagship project of the bilateral relationship.” King Mohammed VI and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the project in 2007.  Construction was launched four years later in 2011. The project cost €2 billion. According to BFMTV, the French government financed 51 percent of the project through various loans, including one granted by the French development agency of €220 million.  In October 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) granted a loan of €80 million to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project. This followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million in 2011 to establish the project.

Rabat – In an interview with AFP, Lyautey high school history teacher Jean-Pierre Riera spoke about the bravery of Moroccan soldiers during the first world war. He said that Moroccan soldiers represented seven percent of the colonial troops involved alongside France. The professor mentioned in his interview two types of Moroccan soldiers: skirmishers and the regiments. Riera said in his interview with AFP, “There was no military service in Morocco at the time, so these [were] voluntary commitments at first.” He said that the volunteers were mostly young men from the countryside. The expert said that the contributors did not know what to expect like all other soldiers participating in the war. The historian said that Moroccans had participated in all the major battles of the first World War. Moroccans were involved as early as the Race to the Sea battle, fought between 17 and October 19, 1914. The French expert said that Moroccan soldiers also participated in two major battles in 1915: the Artois and Champagne battles. They also participated in the the battle of Verdun in 1916 and the famous Battle of the Aisne in 1917.  In 1918, Moroccan skirmishers helped to “limit the damage when the Germans [began] to advance towards Paris.” Riera then said that Moroccan troops then participated in the battles that liberated the territory, which was occupied by the Germans. Twenty-six percent of Moroccan soldiers were wounded, missing, or killed, higher than the 24 percent of French soldiers wounded, missing, or killed, said the French expert. The interview came in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on November 11, 2918. World leaders, including King Mohammed VI, gathered in Paris Sunday to mark the commemoration. The King was accompanied by Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan. The event aimed to pay tribute to those who fought in the Great War. On Tuesday, Rabat will host a study day under the theme “Moroccan Soldiers During the First World War.” The event will be hosted in coordination between Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French embassy in Rabat. It aims to pay homage to the commitment of Moroccan soldiers alongside France.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – In Education First’s 2018 English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), Morocco ranked sixth out of nine African countries. South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia, and Egypt, all scored higher on the index, yet Morocco fared better than Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya. The EF EPI is a standardized, online English proficiency test of both reading and listening skills. Globally, women exhibited a better mastery of English, scoring an average of 54.57, compared to men’s average of 52.63 on the EF EPI’s standardized exam, which grades on a zero to 100 scale. Strikingly, women in Africa continued to widen the gender gap scoring 55.20, compared to 51.58 for their male counterparts; this gap remains larger than any other region in the study. African women also scored higher than European males and slightly lower than European females, the report showed. Sweden, with an average score of 70.72, was the highest-performing country in the world, while Libya appeared in the bottom percentile of the 88 countries assessed, earning a score of 39.64. Morocco’s score of 48.10 represents an incremental improvement from the EF’s 2017 report, which scored the country with 47.91. Women who were tested in Morocco scored 50.50, whereas their male counterparts scored 46.44. The index studied adults 1.3 million candidates, of which 60 percent were women, from across 88 countries and regions. “The Moroccan educational system is exam-oriented. Since listening is not included in the national exam, it’s not given much importance in the teaching of English,” said Mohamed Bakkas, an English language teaching supervisor at the Ministry of Education. Bakkas told Morocco World news that “[m]ost Moroccan teachers skip teaching listening to prepare their students for the national exam. As a result, students’ results in the listening comprehension exam [are] terrible.” Mohammed Hassim, a retired English language teaching supervisor at the Ministry of Education, stated that “being at the bottom of international reports of education is but a logical result of failing educational reforms in Morocco.” Hassim is also an expert in curriculum design and a former president of the Moroccan Association of Teachers of English (MATE). He pointed out that “this failure is not because of the professional qualities of teachers, nor the approaches and methods we adhere to, but…[the] stagnant curriculum and evaluation system” that has remained the same for over a decade. “‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different outcome,’ as Albert Einstein once said,” Hassim added. A previous study published in 2016 showed that Morocco, along with the United Arab Emirates, performed far better in English proficiency within the MENA region. However, compared to other nations, the countries in this region did not score well.

Rabat – The 54-year old miner died only four days after a young miner died in Hassi Belal, near Jerada on Wednesday. Videos of Moroccans condemning the young man’s death went viral last week.  The 54-year-old who died Sunday was a former employee and miner at Moroccan Coal Mining (CDM). According to Moroccan television channel 2M, the miner died while he was attempting to extract coal waste in Hassi Belal. Home to protests in 2017 and 2018, Jerada has witnessed the death of several miners.  On December 23, 2017, two informal miners were crushed while mining underground at an abandoned coal mine in Jerada. Another informal miner died while extracting coal from an illegal mine near Jerada when the walls of the mine collapsed and killed him on February 1, 2018. The death of miners caused a wave of protests as relatives, friends, and sympathizers took to Jerada’s streets to protest social disparities, lack of infrastructure, and unemployment. The protests resulted in a tension between protesters and law enforcement. The police arrested many throughout the days of the protest. On November 8, a Moroccan court sentenced nine people with three-five years for their involvement in the unauthorized protests. The court charged the nine with “destruction of public property, incitement to commit crimes and offenses or participation in a non-violent demonstration,” their lawyer said in a statement to AFP. Five of the protesters received five-year sentences, and four received three-year sentences. Last year, the Moroccan government pledged new economic opportunities for the region including the opening of new mines and a pledge to turn the region into an industrial zone, “which will provide young entrepreneurs in several business sectors with the opportunity to carry out their projects.” The government closed Jerada’s coal mines in 1998. Due to a lack of economic opportunity, many workers in the town take risks to continue extracting resources from the mines. In two separate mine accidents, four informal miners died in December 2017 alone.

Rabat – “Every time we visit the region we witness considerable improvements,” said Ismaila Nimaga, ambassador of the Central African Republic to Rabat. Nimaga said he is impressed by the “rapid transformations” in the region. The aim of the visit, the Central African diplomat explained, is to “bear witness to Morocco’s diverse developments efforts.” The diplomat called Morocco a rising African power, suggesting that Rabat is growing in prominence in North Africa and in the entire African continent. Laayoune is part of the southern provinces that were historically associated with fewer opportunities and fewer government investments. Since 2015, however, the bulk of Morocco’s investment budget has been spent in realizing King Mohammed VI’s insistent calls for an “inclusive and harmonizing development model” to bolster the development of historically left-behind regions. “Moroccan government, private businesses, and NGOs have all recently shouldered their responsibility in investing in equal development of all regions,” Nimaga said. He argued that “these rapid socio-economic transformations” are mostly “due to King Mohammed VI’s personal commitment and political will.” In awe with a region that keeps changing for the better, the Central African said that other African countries, “especially in sub-Saharan Africa,” can learn a lot from Morocco’s recent efforts in its southern provinces. The region, he said, can play a great role in bringing Morocco even closer to its “African brothers.” The visiting ambassadors included Nigeria’s Baba Garba, Ghana’s Stephen Yakubu, and diplomats from DR Congo, the Gambia, Benin, Niger, Sudan, Chad, and Ukraine. Also speaking of the socio-economic transformations in Laayoune, Baba Garba said, “Morocco is on track and is making the right choices.”
“These kinds of projects should be emulated across the entire continent to improve the living standards of vulnerable and low-income classes,” the Nigerian diplomat said. Echoing the sentiments of his Central African counterpart, Baba Garba said that the efforts Morocco has been deploying in the south can serve as a springboard for enhancing the South-South cooperation agenda on the African continent. Ghana’s Stephen Yakubu said that he was “very pleased” that the lion’s share of Morocco’s investments is “actually benefiting local populations.” Remembering that Rabat and Accra signed technical cooperation agreements in February 2017, the Ghanaian official said that his country is hoping to take advantage of Morocco’s expertise in terms of project planning and realization. Initiated under the auspices of King Mohammed VI as part of Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, increasing investments in the southern provinces have borne considerable fruit for Moroccan diplomacy and Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara question. In the past months, multiple foreign delegations have hailed Morocco’s “genuine and sincere” commitment to its southern provinces. Most recently, participants in the Morocco-France Business Forum called Laayoune an “ideal hub” for investments. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the forum on November 2, Philippe-Edern Klein, chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Morocco (CFCIM), said, “The region of the South benefits from ambitious investment programs, both public and private, and major infrastructure projects that make it the ideal hub to the African continent.”

But on Saturday,  Algerian news outlet TSA quoted an authorized source anonymously speaking on the King’s offer to Algeria. The source described the King’s offer as “questionable,” aiming for the “bilateralism” of the Western Sahara conflict. For Algeria, according to the source, King Mohammed VI’s offer “is a non-event that does not deserve a formal answer.” Politicizing the offer On the 43rd anniversary of the Green March on Tuesday, the King said that Morocco is open to receive any “proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations.” For Algeria, however, King Mohammed VI’s call is not “sincere.” In an interview with Al Araby Al Jadeed, an anonymous Algerian diplomat said that Algeria would accept Morocco’s offer with conditions. Algeria’s conditions include the “end of diplomatic and media propaganda campaigns between the two countries; the end of the flow of drugs into Algeria; good neighborliness and a comprehensive settlement through dialogue; and neutralizing the conflict of Western Sahara and keeping it within the context of the auspices of the United Nations.” TSA’s authorized source has echoed the same conditions Morocco must meet before re-establishing bilateral ties is possible. According to the Algerian news outlet, Algeria will consider reopening the world’s longest closed land border, which has  been shut for over 20 years, if Morocco meets its conditions. But Morocco will likely not accept Algeria’s demands because they are against Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria, which hosts Sahrawis in Tindouf, has denied responsibility in the conflict for many years. It also believes that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Morocco and the Polisario Front separatist group. Algeria is also lobbying against Morocco’s position on the conflict in the US. According to exclusive information obtained by Morocco World News, Algeria has signed a $30,000-per-month contract with the Keene Consulting firm, owned by John Bolton’s friend, David Keene. The contract, received by MWN, says that Keene “shall provide counsel to and conduct lobbying activities for Algeria to reinforce friendship relations and cooperation between Algeria and the US.” Since Bolton’s appointment in March, political analysts have speculated that Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, might use his voice against Morocco on the Western Sahara conflict. Bolton was a part of   UN Special Envoy James Baker’s team and played a key role in the Framework Agreement plan known as Plan Baker II. Strongly rejected by Morocco, the plan provided for five years of Western Sahara autonomy under Morocco’s sovereignty followed by a referendum on self-determination with independence. Morocco, however, sees its autonomy plan as the only solution to end the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – Photos of the King and the Crown Prince standing along with other world leaders symbolize Morocco’s key contributions during the two World Wars. The King and Moulay El Hassan were greeted by world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump. The picture of the Moroccan monarch sitting in the first row next to the world leaders was widely shared by thousands of Moroccans.  Many pointed out that the picture shows the gratitude that France has toward Morocco for the role Moroccans played in WWI and WWII. Flashback A picture of Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan shaking hands with US President Donald Trump symbolizes Morocco’s major contribution in the second World War. The picture, which also features King Mohammed VI and other world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, also provides a symbolic image for the world. The photo reminds people of the late King Hassan II and his participation in 1943 that marked a turning point in WWII and on Morocco’s subsequent independence. Several world leaders participated in the Anfa Conference, including former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Some people shared the photo of the Crown Prince during his participation at today’s event and a similar photo of the late King Hassan II during his participation at the Anfa Conference in Casablanca at the age of 14 along with his father, Sultan Mohammed V. Despite his young age, the Crown Prince made several appearances in official events inside and outside Morocco. His first appearance was in 2017 at the One Summit in France, where he was warmly welcomed by world leaders. Today marks the second official international appearance of Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan. Morocco’s contribution  Nearly 40,000 Moroccan soldiers participated in the first World War. The soldiers took part in every major battle throughout the period of the first World War. Moroccan soldiers accounted for seven present of the colonial troops fighting alongside France.  Moroccan soldiers, whose major participation during World War I was commended throughout the world, also took part in the second World War. Known as “mountain warriors,” the Moroccan soldiers showed bravery during the second World War. Historians believe that Morocco contributed 85,000, soldiers between 1942 and 1945. The number represents more than double the amount of soldiers who contributed to the first World War (40,000).  More than 1,000 soldiers died in action, while more than 800 were wounded. The Moroccan soldiers participated in major and fierce battles during the second World War in the Mediterranean, including in Tunisia, Corsica, and Sicily, and in the liberation of  Marseille. Moroccan soldiers also participated in battles to liberate Paris.

Rabat – Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has, for the first time, acknowledged the existence of recordings that prove the murder of the prominent Saudi journalist, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. On Saturday, Erdogan announced that Turkey gave the recordings to Saudi Arabia, the US, Germany, France, and the UK. Since October, Turkish anonymous authorities said that Turkey has evidence of the murder of Khashoggi. The existence of recordings was not officially confirmed until Saturday. Before leaving Turkey to attend commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War 1 in France, Erdogan said, “We gave the tapes.” “We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,” Erdogan said. The recordings have pre-conversations before the murder was committed. Al Jazeera reported that a source said that “traces of acid were found at the Saudi consul-general’s residence” in Istanbul. Khashoggi went missing on October 2, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. His absence sparked outrage internationally as surveillance cameras have not captured his exit from the consulate. Nearly two weeks after his absence, Saudi Arabia admitted that the journalist died in a “fistfight” inside the consulate. After several days Saudi Arabia said that Khashoggi’s death was premeditated. The international community, along with Khashoggi’s two sons, have been calling on Saudi Arabia to reveal the location of Khashoggi’s body. Khashoggi’s sons recently spoke up in an interview with CNN. During the interview, Salah and Abdullah said they have asked Saudi Arabia to return Khashoggi’s body. “I really hope that whatever happened wasn’t painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death,” said Abdullah. Salah said that the only thing Khashoggi’s family wants is to “bury him in Al-Baqi [cemetery] in Medina with the rest of his family.” Last week, BBC shared exclusive information about the murder. Turkish officials told the news outlet that Saudi Arabia sent a a “toxicologist and a chemical expert” to its consulate in Istanbul to clean up evidence of the murder.  Investigators believe that the journalist was strangled to death and his body dismembered.

Washington D.C – Unlike in the past when the King devoted the bulk of his speech to defending Morocco’s position on the Sahara and denouncing Algeria’s efforts to thwart Morocco’s efforts to end the conflict, the Moroccan monarch sounded a friendly tone towards Algeria, opening Morocco’s arms and offering to engage in meaningful dialogue without preconditions and in good faith. The flavor of the speech elicited the praise of several countries, such as France, Spain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Mauritania, Jordan as well as the United Nations Secretary-General. They were all unanimous in supporting Morocco’s offer to engage in dialogue with Algeria. Algeria has still not issued any official statement on the Moroccan offer. Meanwhile, analysts are wondering whether the Moroccan offer is genuine and seeks to appease tensions between the two countries and pave the way towards a normalization of their relations or whether it is a ruse intended to embarrass the Algerian government. King Mohammed VI firmly believes in the Maghreb For starters, though King Mohammed VI has placed the Maghreb on the back burner in his recent speeches, the King has always been a firm believer in the need to achieve the unity and integration of Maghreb countries, mainly Morocco and Algeria. In his Ph.D. thesis, which he defended when he was still crown prince in 1993, King Mohammed VI argued that building a unified Maghreb and ending the rivalry between Morocco and Algeria was the only way for Maghreb countries to receive fair treatment from the European Union. Since his ascendance to the throne, King Mohammed VI has repeatedly advocated for the reopening of the border between the two countries, expressed Morocco’s readiness to normalize its relations with Algeria, and called on Algerian officials to engage in dialogue. The border has been closed since 1994. In the summer of 2004, the Moroccan government lifted the visa requirement for Algerian travelers willing to visit Morocco. Ever since, Morocco has called on many occasions for the reopening of land borders between the two countries. However, its calls fell on deaf ears with Algerian officials not showing any willingness to make reciprocal overtures. What makes Morocco’s new invitation noteworthy is the appeasing tone of the King, as well as the context in which it was framed. The offer was made in the wake of the adoption of Resolution 2440, which extended the mandate of the UN mission to the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, for six months. For the first time since 2002 and since the start of the UN-led political process in 2007, Algeria is mentioned in a Security Council resolution on the conflict on quasi-equal footing with Morocco. While Algeria it still not considered a party to the conflict, the new language of the resolution could open the door progressively for the Security Council to consider it as party to it. In addition, the resolution adds new language that puts more emphasis on the need for neighboring states, Algeria and Mauritania, to engage in the political process. Morocco shows willingness to turn the page In light of the new language of the resolution and in preparation for the roundtable, which will take place in Geneva December 5-6 under the auspices of the UN personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, Morocco wants to place on record for the whole world to see that it is willing to engage in genuine and honest dialogue to thaw tension between the two countries and prepare conditions for confidence-building between its officials, which could eventually pave the way towards normalizing ties between the two countries.  By doing so, Morocco conveys to the Security Council its willingness to engage Algeria and work with it towards reaching an understanding on ways to overcome all the obstacles to solve the Western Sahara conflict. In the event Algeria rejects Morocco’s offer, the latter could argue that it has done its part to for constructive dialogue between the two countries, but the other party has refused. But it remains uncertain whether Algeria will reject or accept Morocco’s invitation to engage in honest and meaningful dialogue. There are two scenarios for how Algeria will react to Morocco’s offer: One is very optimistic and may prove to be wishful thinking, and the other is a more realistic prospect that will most likely come to pass. Under the first scenario, Algeria will follow the logic of history, geography, shared language, and religion and open its arms to Morocco. In recent years, many former Algerian officials have deplored the closure of the border between the two countries and called on their leaders to end this anachronism. In addition, there have been many grassroots initiatives organized on both sides of the borders calling on the two countries to normalize their ties. As recently as July 22, Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that Moroccan and Algerian associations organized a march from the Moroccan city of Oujda and the Algerian city of Maghniya towards the border at Zouj Bghal. Algeria will reject Morocco’s offer for dialogue Under the second scenario, which I believe is the most likely, Algeria will turn down Morocco’s offer and insist that opening dialogue or the border would be contingent on Morocco’s acceptance of conditions Algeria laid down in 2013. Reacting to Morocco’s call to Algeria to reopen the border at the time, the spokesperson of the Algerian government stressed that it would only happen with “the cessation of the smear campaign against Algeria; a sincere, efficient and productive cooperation against the aggression that we undergo daily in the field of drug infiltration; as well as the respect of the position of the Algerian Government with regard to the question of Western Sahara which we consider to be a question of decolonization which must find a settlement in accordance with international law within the United Nations.” There is also a possibility that Algeria will never react officially to Morocco’s offer. While Algerian officials have not officially reacted to King Mohammed VI’s demand, some former Algerian officials and an authorized source told Algerian media that the Moroccan offer is “suspicious.” Over the past five years, there has been no sign indicating that Algeria is ready to open a new chapter in bilateral relations. The same leadership is still governing the country, and the military and the intelligence services still maintain the upper hand on decision-making. In addition, Algeria has left no stone unturned to thwart every Moroccan effort to advance its position on the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria has continued its efforts to undermine Morocco and opposed its return to the African Union behind the scenes, though to no avail. Facts belie Algeria’s statements While the Algerian government continues to claim that it has no vested interests in the Western Sahara conflict and is only a neighboring country, the facts on the ground and information in the public domain belies those claims. It is an open secret that Algeria is Polisario’s main lifeline, and without it, the separatist group would stand no chance to survive nor enjoy diplomatic support. It is self-evident that Algeria supports the Polisario at the financial, political, diplomatic, and military levels. A quick comparison between Mauritania, another neighboring country concerned with the conflict, and Algeria shows the difference between an actual neighboring country and a real party to the conflict. Despite some periods of tension with Morocco, there is no evidence that Mauritania has provided military, diplomatic, financial, or political support to the Polisario. Nor is there any evidence that Mauritania has ever lobbied foreign governments on behalf of Polisario. Conversely, Algeria not only hosts Polisario and supports it financially, militarily, and diplomatically, but it also lobbies foreign governments on behalf of the separatist group. Over the past 27 years, the Algerian government has relied mainly on the services of lobbying firm Foley Hoag to help it secure US support for the Polisario Front.  Since it renewed its contract with Foley Hoag in 2007, the Algerian government has been spending $400,000 per year to ensure that Morocco does not end the conflict in its favor. Recently, Foley Hoag was among the signatories of a letter sent to the Security Council on September 28, which called for pressuring Morocco to enter into direct negotiations with Polisario and for preserving the right of the Sahrawis to choose their future.   Furthermore, the recent developments at the Security Council have provided more evidence that Algeria is a party to the Western Sahara conflict. As a result of the new dynamic created by Security Council Resolution 2440, Algeria moved to sign a new lobbying contract worth $360,000 per year with Keene Consulting. David Keene, the chairman of the firm, is the former president of the US National Rifle Association, and a close friend to US National Security Adviser John Bolton. It is very telling that the new contract was signed just three days after the Security Council adopted a new resolution in which Algeria is mentioned for the first time and in which it is called upon to participate in the political process without preconditions and in good faith. Keene was quoted by Al Monitor as saying that he “will work on issues related to the disputed Western Sahara as well as military and defense cooperation.” This will not be the first time Keene will work on behalf of the Algerian government. Keene had already lobbied the Bush administration and Congress on behalf of Algeria as part of the lobbying contract signed between the Algerian government and the Carmen Group in 2006-2007.  In addition, in 2010 he authored an op-ed in the Hill in which he lashed out at Morocco and used the same talking points used by the Algerian government regarding the Western Sahara conflict. In June 2016, he authored an hagiographic op-ed about former Polisario leader Mohamed Abdelaziz in which he described him as “great leader” and a “Muslim democrat.”  Based on these facts, I am intimately convinced that Algeria is determined to pursue the same aggressive and malignant foreign policy against Morocco and will, therefore, deem King Mohammed VI’s offer for dialogue a non-starter. As Algeria is ruled by the same political and military oligarchy, it would be illusory to think the opening of a new chapter in relations between the two countries is possible. In Algeria’s foreign policy doctrine, Morocco is not viewed as a partner, but as an adversary and an existential threat to its dream for hegemony over the region. Nevertheless, regardless of Algeria’s reaction to Morocco’s offer, King Mohammed VI will have succeeded in exposing its duplicity and blatant contradictions. The Moroccan monarch is undoubtedly aware that his offer will fall on deaf ears like his previous offers, but he made it, nonetheless, to embarrass Algeria and expose its contradictions. Algeria is now facing a tough dilemma. If it accepts Morocco’s offer without preconditions, it will leave the door open for future bilateral talks between the two countries about the Sahara. If it rejects the offer based on the claim that Morocco should respect its position on the conflict and that Algeria is not a party to it, it would be contradicted by the lobbying contracts it signed with Washington D.C.-based companies to lobby the Trump administration and Congress about the same conflict. The deafening silence of the Algerian government five days after King Mohammed’s offer is very telling about the confusion in which Algerian officials have found themselves after the Moroccan monarch took them by surprise.

Rabat – Upon his arrival at the Elysee Palace, King Mohammed VI was received by French President Emmanuel Macron and French first lady Brigitte Macron. World leaders, including the King, German Chancellor Angella Merkel, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan walked to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris today morning. In front of world leaders, young students read out letters from combatants in English, Chinese and French at the commemoration, marking the 100th anniversary of the Armistice. Marking the break out of peace after World War I (1912-1918), the ceremony aims to remember the sacrifice of soldiers who participated in the deadliest war,  killing around 17 million soldiers and civilians across the world. It also offers the opportunity to honor many Moroccan victims who contributed to World War I. For their bravery, Moroccan soldiers become known to Germans as “swallows of dear.” The commemoration of this day also aim to raise awareness on the circumstances of wars.it also invites young generations to learn lessons from the past and to avoid making same errors, urging them to build a secure, prosperous and peaceful future, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). At the start of the ceremony, French-born Chinese-American cellist Yo-yo Ma performed a masterpiece to pay a tribute to the victims of thewar. The event also marks the participation of Morocco’s crown Prince Moulay el Hassan, who is accompanying his father King Mohammed VI throughout the event. Photographers covering the event captured the elegantly dressed Moroccan price. This is the second time that the 15-year old prince traveled with the king for an official visit after his participation at the One Planet Summit in France. Prince’s participation in the summit was welcomed by international officials, including  Macron who warmly received Moulay El Hassan in the Elysee Palace.  Prince’s participation in the summit was welcomed by international officials, including  Macron who warmly received Moulay El Hassan in the Elysee Palace.

Rabat – The contract entered into effect on November 1 and will continue through October 31, 2019. Algeria hired David Keene, a former president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to lobby against Morocco in the Western Sahara issue.  Keene told Al-Monitor that he “will work on issues related to the disputed  Western Sahara as well as military and defense cooperation,” as part of the one-year contract with his firm. According to the contract signed between Keene Consulting firm and the Algerian government, which was obtained by Morocco World News, Keene “shall provide counsel to and conduct lobbying activities# for Algeria to reinforce friendship relations and cooperation between Algeria and the US. Some of the activities include mobilization of “non-governmental organizational, public and media support for Algeria,” and “enhancing Algeria’s image” in the US. Under the agreement, Keene will regularly have in-person and telephone contact with Algeria’s Ambassador to the US Madjid Bouguerra.  Keene had a similar lobbying job for Algeria between 2006 and 2007 on behalf of the Carmen Group, a lobbying firm in Washington, DC. Keene was responsible for managing the firm’s services for Algeria. According to Washington Post, the Carmen Group worked to strengthen the US-Algeria relations and expand trade, through government relations and “strategic advice.” The group was also in charge of projecting “an up-to-date image of Algeria’ and promote congressional, public and media support for ‘Algeria’s legitimate interests and policy goals,’” Washington Post reported on July 6, 2006. Keene has a close friendship with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. Keene’s friendship with Bolton first made him seriously interested in Western Sahara and Sahrawis. The former NRA’s chief told Al-Monitor that Bolton first put him in contact with Algerian and Polisario officials. Polisario is an Algeria-funded group which has been in conflict with Morocco over Western Sahara since 1976. Backed by Algeria, Polisario’s main goal is to take over Western Sahara. Keene said he visited the Tindouf camps in Algeria in 2000 and became “very good friends” with Mohamed Abdelaziz, the former Polisario leader, according to Al Monitor. “My daughter was over there as a volunteer in the camp for about six or eight months in the early 2000s, and I had hosted [Bolton] when he came here and we developed a friendship,” Keene said. In 2011, Keene appointed Bolton to the NRA’s international affairs subcommittee. While Algeria has long claimed it is not a party to the Western Sahara conflict, this is the second contract it has signed with a lobbying firm in Washington D.C. to help thwart Morocco’s efforts to put an end to this territorial dispute.  In addition to Keene Consulting, Algeria has been linked since 2007 with lobbying firm Foley Hoag, which undertakes lobbying activities in the US administration and both houses of Congress on behalf the Algerian government.  According to Al Monitor, Foley Hoag activities focus on members of the Senate who are sympathetic to the Polisario, such as senator James Inhofe (republican representing Oklahoma), who visited the Tindouf camps in 2017.

By Zakaria Oudrhiri Rabat – Moroccan political scientist Hassan Aourid of Mohammed V University related Morocco’s contribution to World War I.  To persuade men to join the fight against the Axis powers, the French relied on religious discourse in mosques and the “super caid policy,” which depended on local authorities. At first, Aourid said, the French were skeptical of Moroccan soldiers. Before  they joined troops, the French described Moroccans as “unreliable soldiers.” But when General Lyautey decided to engage Moroccan soldiers on the front lines, that view changed.  Moroccan soldiers proved themselves on the battlefield, becoming known to Germans as “swallows of death” (hirondelles de la mort) for their bravery. Aourid’s fellow panelists, T. Jeremy Gunn of the International University of Rabat and Alexander Wilson of King’s College London, explained how, 100 years after the cessation of hostilities in the “War to End All Wars,” the world is still shaped by conflict and the legacy of the first World War. Gunn, a law professor, spoke about the Wilsonian dream of international cooperation and US President Woodrow Wilson’s doctrine of peace that led to the creation of the League of Nations which, in turn, shaped the New World Order.  Wilsonian idealism, Gunn said, is the opposite of nationalism, and inspired the creation of international conflict resolution institutions. While nationalism has always been an ingredient for war, Wilsonianism represents peace and dialogue. Alexander Wilson, a defense studies professor, pointed out that colonial Britain was not so much a power in the Middle East as a conflict-management authority. Wilson cited Eugene Rogan’s “The Arabs: A History” as a compelling introduction to the role British policy had on the Middle East. Mohammed V University’s Faculty of Law, Economics, and Social Studies hosted the panel, sponsored by the US and British embassies, in Rabat on Friday, November 9.

Rabat- The data, which assesses crime rates, terrorism threats, risk of natural disasters, and health issues in 20 countries, revealed Morocco as a destination with less crime and terrorism compared to some European countries, and the US. Morocco is considered safer than Jordan, France, and Italy.  The study’s crime rates are based on statistics by the World Economic Fund, likelihood of major natural disasters on the World Risk Report, health risks on the NHS Fit for Travel website, and terrorism risk levels on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) assessment. !function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"); In terms of terrorism worldwide, “Terrorism can’t be ruled out anywhere,” the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote. However, the report states that terrorism is “very likely in Australia, Jordan, France, the US, India, Thailand and Turkey,” more so than in Morocco and other countries. Health risks are notable in travel destinations such as Singapore and Australia affected by dengue fever, and areas of India, South Africa, and Thailand affected by malaria, according to the report. Morocco ranks among the world’s least dangerous countries, according to the US Department of State’s January report. The State Department advised Americans visiting Morocco to “exercise normal precautions” in the North African country. The department advises US travelers to be extra cautious in Algeria or avoid it because of high terrorist threats.  Morocco received 8.7 million tourists from January to August 2018, according to the latest statistics by the Ministry of Tourism. Tourist arrivals from Italy made the most considerable increase between the first eight months of 2017 and 2018, rising 14 percent. German tourist numbers increased 10 percent, French 7 percent, and Dutch 6 percent.

Rabat – The Midelt wind farm is the first part of the 850 megawatt Integrated Wind Project (PEI) which includes four other wind farms, Enel Green Power (EGP) wrote in a statement on November 5. The Midelt wind farm will cost MAD 2.5 billion and is expected to be complete in 2 years. Morocco’s National Electricity Office (ONEE), the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), and a consortium of both EGP and the Moroccan energy company Nareva all signed financing agreements on November 5 to start the wind farm’s construction. The project is “financed through equity investments from shareholders as well as debt financing from ONEE,” according to EGP. The Midelt wind farm “is set to contribute to the economic and social development of Morocco, and particularly that of the Midelt region, notably in terms of job creation and use of local services,” wrote EGP. The Midelt farm is expected to have enough capacity to power a city like Agadir, with 500,000 inhabitants, and save 400,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. “With this first, important step that we are taking today, Enel Green Power will support Morocco’s energy demand and help the country meet its objective to increase power generation from renewables, as announced in its Domestic Energy Strategy,” said Antonio Cammisecra, head of EGP.  Once the Midelt wind farm becomes operational, the companies will sell the electricity produced to ONEE for a 20-year power purchase agreement.  The blades and towers of the wind farm will be manufactured in Morocco through Spanish Siemens Gamesa, the only supplier of wind turbines for the project. The EGP and Nareva consortium were awarded the 850 megawatt Integrated Wind Project following an international tender. The wind project will cost MAD 12 billion. The project, according to EGP, “marks a turning point in Morocco’s national energy strategy, aimed at meeting the country’s growing demand for electricity, at competitive prices while complying with Morocco’s sustainable development goals.” Nareva CEO Said El Hadi said, “The 850 MW [Integrated Wind Project] is a project that will enable Morocco to make significant progress in meeting its energy strategy.”  “We are pleased to support the Government in achieving its goal of increasing the share of renewable energy to 52% of the country’s installed capacity by 2030,” El Hadi added. On November 2, King Mohammed VI chaired a meeting to follow up the implementation of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy. During the meeting, the King gave instructions “to increase the initial ambitions for renewable energy to exceed the current goal of 52 percent of the national electric mix by 2030.” The other four wind farms included in the 850 megawatt wind projects will be built in Tangier (100 megawatts), Jbel Lahdid (200 megawatts) in western Morocco, and Tiskrad (300 megawatts) and Boujdour (100 megawatts) in southern provinces.

By Mohamed Bella Rabat- “Burnout” is the third and final movie in the trilogy that began with “Casanegra” and “Zero.”  The three films fared well at the Moroccan box office. The movie will be competing at the FIFB’s fourth festival November 18-23. The movie depicts the stories of three individuals  living in separate worlds, all affected by social and economic status.

Macron invited several other world leaders, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to Paris’ Elysee Palace to attend a ceremony commemorating the end of World War 1 on November 11, 1918. The celebration is scheduled to start on Saturday. The palace will host a banquet honoring the world leaders and a Picasso art exhibition in the Musee d’Orsay of Paris. Trump and Macron met on Saturday morning, following social media tension between the two presidents. Trump took offense when his French counterpart proposed that Europe create its own continental military force, considering it “very insulting” in a tweet on Friday. President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018 
Trump wrote: “President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!” “We can’t defend Europe if we don’t have a real European army,” he said. “We must have a Europe that can defend itself more, without just relying on the U.S.” A possible confrontation between Trump and Turkish President Erdogan over the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is also anticipated during the meeting.

By Josh Babb Rabat – Several accidental deaths in defunct mines initially sparked the protests in Jerada last December, which extended until the spring of this year.  The nine sentences on Thursday were the first punishments to be formally handed down in the Jerada case by the Moroccan court system in the nearby city of Oujda. The court charged the nine with “destruction of public property, incitement to commit crimes and offenses or participation in a non-violent demonstration,” their lawyer said in a statement to AFP.  The court gave its ruling one day after another informal miner, 25, died in a mine collapse on Wednesday, November 7. The judicial system held all nine in custody since mid-March following prolonged clashes between protesters and police. The government closed Jerada’s coal mines in 1998. Due to a lack of economic opportunity, many workers in the town take risks to continue extracting resources from the mines. In two separate mine accidents, four informal miners died in December alone.   Demonstrations quickly swelled in size attracting as many as 20,000 people, all calling for the Moroccan government to fix the economic and social disparities which plague the region. The protests sometimes turned violent. In mid-March demonstrators clashed with police and torched five police vehicles, causing an unspecified number of injuries to officers and activists.  Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, criticized the government’s response, saying, “The authorities must allow peaceful protest by prioritising the safety of protesters. People should be free to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and security forces should never be allowed to use excessive force against protesters.” In the wake of the Jerada protests, Moroccan officials have pledged new economic opportunities for the region including the opening of new mines and a pledge to turn the region into an industrial zone, “which will provide young entrepreneurs in several business sectors with the opportunity to carry out their projects.”

Rabat- Following the weekly government council on Thursday, El Khalfi announced in a news conference that the government approved Draft Law 39-89 permitting the privatization of public institutions and decided to sell La Mamounia. Marrakech Mayor Mohamed Larbi Belkaid previously told Bloomberg that “the hotel had stopped distributing dividends to shareholders for eight to 10 years through 2017, mainly because of the repayment of loans obtained to fund a major overhaul.” Morocco’s state-run rNational Railway Office (ONCF) owns 60 percent of La Mamounia. The state-owned investment management fund Caisse de Depot and Gestion (CDG) and the city council of Marrakech own 20 percent each. The government’s decision came to reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019 and to improve their governance. Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun declared in October that the Moroccan economy requires measures to mobilize resources, control spending, and reduce the burden on the investment budget. He also noted the impact which the rising prices of oil and gas, which peaked in early October, will have on financial balances. Built in 1923, La Mamounia Hotel is a prestigious hotel known worldwide. It received a makeover at the hands of French designer Jacques Garcia in 2009. The hotel has earned many awards since its reopening in 2009. In February, interior design magazine Architectural Digest listed La Mamounia among the “7 Most Historically Significant Hotels in the World.” Rumors had it that the government might privatize ONCF. However, Benchaaboun said that government will not privatize ONCF but may consider selling stakes in Maroc Telecom, the country’s main telecommunication company.

Rabat – Nearly 10 months since his arrest in February, Bouachrine has received a heavy prison sentence of 12 years after being convicted of human trafficking, rape with violence, and sexual assault. Bouachrine, who is the director of one of Morocco’s major newspapers, Akhbar Al Yaoum and its online outlet Alyaoum24, was given the chance to make his closing statement today at the sentencing hearing.  The sentence was given today at about 12 midnight.  The final hearing started at about 5:00 p.m.  During the trial, Bouachrine said: “I am a victim of freedom of expression, I am a journalist and I will not sell myself.”  He added, “I’d be lying if I said that I’m not scared to be tried, even if we strive for the stability of the country, what country is this that we want to leave our grandchildren.” Bouachrine stressed that the videos which were recently published online were “fake.” Bouachrine said that the person in the videos was not him, but also pointed out that the people shown were engaging in “consensual sex.” Protest prior to verdict To denounce the trial of the journalist, Morocco’s Truth and Justice Commission organized a protest today in front of Parliament hours before the court announced its verdict. The commission invited activists and citizens who care for justice and the freedom of press to voice their support in the protest. “This protest is organized to contest the court’s decision to prosecute Bouachrine in private. There were violations in the trial,” a Truth and Justice Commission member, Khadija Radi, told Morocco World News during the protest. Abdelali Hamidine, a Justice and Development Party member and a friend of the journalist, told Morocco World News that Bouachrine’s trial was a “political trial in the absence of evidence to prove the crimes attributed to him.” Protesters supporting Bouachrine sang slogans against the government and carried banners reading: “Freedom for Journalist Taoufik Bouachrine” and “Fair Trial for Bouachrine.” During his arrest in February, Moroccan police allegedly seized 50 tapes depicting sexual acts as evidence of the alleged crimes attributed to Bouachrine. The journalist’s arrest shocked many and resulted in backlash from Bouachrine’s supporters. In September, a number of news outlets shared a series of leaked screenshots of the videos allegedly captured from the tapes seized in the arrest of the journalist. Some of the pictures show what appears to be Bouachrine with women in his office. In response, Morocco’s National Press strongly condemned the leaking of screenshots in an ongoing case. Mohammed Ziane, a member of the journalist’s defense team, said that experts that analyzed the video said that the footage was faked. Following Bouachrine’s arrest, the case’s public prosecutor issued a statement, announcing that the arrest followed the complaints of several women journalists that worked for Bouachrine. The women allegedly filed complaints of sexual harassment, assault, rape, and attempted rape. Bouachrine denied all the accusations and claimed the videos were fake. During a press conference on March 12, the public prosecutor said that the argument made by Bouachrine’s lawyers against the judicial police “has no legal basis” and the accusations of video falsification are “unfounded.” The trial process, which was postponed multiple times, witnessed tension between the defense team and court officials. On May 25, Casablanca’s Bar Association President Hassan Birouaine condemned the behavior of Bouachrine’s defense team. He said the bar condemned the unprecedented behavior and “rabid reactions” of some lawyers in the Bouachrine case. The statement came in response to Ziane’s explicit language in front of the press after a hearing, shouting that the videos were “porn” footage. In response, Birouaine accused some lawyers in the Bouachrine case of “denigrating the uniform of lawyers.”

Rabat – Speaking with Morocco World News, the journalist said that some people told him not to take photos while he was trying to take some at the hall of Casablanca’s Court of Appeal. “I stopped immediately when some people told me that I cannot take photos.” After a while, Bouachrine’s brother lashed out at the MWN journalist and forcefully took his phone. “He told me to delete pictures and I told him that I did not take any and that he can check himself,” the journalist said. After returning the phone to the journalist, Bouachrine’s brother attacked the journalist a second time and broke his phone. The attack against the Morocco World News journalist happened in front of several journalists. The MWN journalist received such treatment from Bouachrine’s brother, who, himself, deplored the “lack of press freedom” throughout his trial. The Morocco World News team, therefore, condemns the unprofessional and irresponsible act of Bouachrine’s brother against its journalist.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The newest rules come after the Saudi’s September announcement that the country will no longer issue visas for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon and, East Jerusalem. The combined rule changes will ban nearly 3 million Palestinians from completing the pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the five tenets of Islam.  The change comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was recently quoted praising Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) and talked about the necessity of maintaining stability in Riyadh, which has faced international criticism in the wake of the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi. The Hajj falls every year on the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha while the umrah can be performed at any time. While Israel and Saudi Arabia have no official diplomatic relations, and Israeli citizens are officially barred from entering Saudi Arabia there had been a previous workaround.  In 1978 Jordan’s King Hussein began to allow Israeli citizens wishing to perform the Hajj to travel to Jordan where they were issued temporary passports that would allow them to enter Saudi Arabia.  The Hajj pilgrimage is traditionally organized by committee’s local to a citizens country, it was last December that the chairman of Israel’s chapter Hajj Salim Salata had learned that Saudi officials would no longer honor the temporary Jordanian passports. “We have no explanation for what happened, so we appealed to every possible avenue of help, but to our great regret the pilgrimage that was supposed to take place in December, for which thousands of people have registered, will not be held,” Shalata said. Jordan’s Ministry of Awqaf Islamic Affairs and Holy Places said it was in negotiations with Saudi counterparts regarding the issue but no plans to resolve it had been announced.  A Haaretz article speculated that the new rule change was announced ahead of the possibility that Muslim citizens of Israel could travel directly between the country and Saudi Arabia, perhaps yet another sign of warming relations between the two nations.

Rabat – In a press conference after the country’s weekly meeting, Mauritanian Minister of Communication Sidi Mohamed Ould Maham said, “We welcome any initiative, and we wish it every success.” For many years, Morocco has called for Algeria to take responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. In contrast, Algeria says that it should only be an observer to the conflict, claiming that the solution for the Western Sahara issue should be found by Morocco and the Polisario only. The situation has created diplomatic tension between the two countries. In addition, the Algerian-Moroccan border, closed in 1994, is the world’s longest closed land border. Ould Maham added that his country encourages moves to ensure the stability and security of the region, as well as good neighborliness. While Spain, France, Qatar, and the UAE have welcomed Morocco’s dialogue proposal, Algeria has not yet issued any statement regarding the royal speech. Mauritania will take part in the Geneva round-table, which will take place on December 5-6 as initial talks on the Western Sahara conflict. At the request of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario will all convene in Geneva to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution for the four-decade-long conflict.

Rabat- The protest, starting at 6 p.m. today, will come during the sentencing hearing which started Friday afternoon and will announce the verdict in Bouachrine’s case at the Casablanca Court of Appeals.  Nearly 10 months since his arrest and repeated delays in his trial, Bouachrine will give his closing argument Friday before the court hands down its ruling.  The Truth and Justice Commission condemns the “use of judicial power to settle differences in political opinions” and rejects “the crackdown on journalists and freedom of the press in the country.” In a press statement, the commission wrote: “All those who care for the freedom of press are invited to join the protest before the Parliament at six p.m., to bring justice for Bouachrine” and call for a “fair trial.” Bouachrine is the owner and director of the Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper and Al Yaoum 24 news website. Police arrested the journalist at the newspaper’s headquarters in Casablanca. Bouachrine is facing several charges, including exploiting people in need, and abusing power for sexual purposes—complaints brought by his coworkers. The journalist is also suspected of other crimes, including violent rape and attempted rape. Some believe the charges were fabricated because of Bouachrine’s critical reporting on prominent politicians. Bouachrine appeared before the criminal court in Casablanca for the first time on March 8 after he was arrested and put into custody on February 28. A lawyer for one of the complainants, Mohamed Kerrout, said in September that some leaked videos and screenshots of evidence published in some Moroccan news outlets were real. Some of the photos published showed what appears to be Bouachrine with women in his office.

Rabat – Yesterday, the World Food Program announced its plans to double its existing aid program, which currently provides food to 7-8 million Yemeni war victims.  In a statement released on Thursday, the organization said, “WFP food and other humanitarian support has been instrumental in helping to prevent famine, but the indications are that even greater efforts will be needed to avert mass starvation.” According to the WFP, the projected aid expansion will include both food supplies and cash-based transfers.  The United Nations describes Yemen as the largest hunger crisis in the world with millions of people on the brink of famine in a situation that is worsening each day. Over the past week, escalating attacks from the Saudi-led coalition, which has been supported by the US, have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Attacks in the rebel Houthi-held city of Hodeidah are hurting the main humanitarian lifelines to Yemen.  Due to the ongoing offensive, Yemen peace talks will be pushed off until “the end of the year” according to UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths.  In response to the escalated attacks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters, “Yemen today stands on a precipice. On the humanitarian side, the situation is desperate. We must do all we can to prevent the already dire conditions from deteriorating.”

Rabat- The government’s last-minute decision to stay on Daylight Saving Time or GMT+1 year-round angered and confusing Moroccans, inspiring protests by hundreds of students in Marrakech, Fez, Meknes, Sale, Casablanca, Beni Mellal, Khenifra, Errachidia, and the town of Kelaat Sraghna in central Morocco. Earlier this week, students in Fez marched in the streets, condemning GMT+1 and calling on the government to move back to the previous standard time, GMT. Later, Casablanca’s Ain Borja, Sale, and Meknes skipped classes and stood in front of prefecture and outside their schools to condemn the clock decision and to call on the Ministry of Education to keep schools’ traditional time-table. Beginning Thursday, sit-ins transformed into large marches in Beni Mellal, Khenifra in north-central Morocco, Errachidia in the eastern Draa Tafilalet region, and in other parts of the economic capital of Casablanca. Beni Mellal:  Errachidia: 
Khenifra:   
Casablanca:  Marching on streets and even on tramway lines in Casablanca, armies of students shouted and chanted, “The people want to change the clock.”  Some students even climbed a public clock in Kelaat Sraghna to change the time back to GMT. 
Morocco was set to end DST and return to standard time on Sunday, October 28. The government’s surprise October 26 move to stay on DST, asserting that it would “benefit” the public and save energy, caused widespread condemnation. Many criticized officials for not “taking public opinion into consideration.” The government’s decision followed soon after the European Commission’s proposal in September that EU member states should stop changing the time for the summer and be free to decide whether to “permanently apply summer or wintertime.”  The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that the proposed change would be implemented on Sunday, March 31, 2019, as the last mandatory change to summer time. Then, it would be up to the member states who wish to permanently switch back to wintertime to do so on Sunday, October 27, 2019. Many Moroccan students wished that the government would go back on its decision to keep Morocco on GMT+1—set to sync with its European neighbors France and Spain—so that their usual school times would remain unchanged.  “We ask [the government] to remove the daylight saving, and we also ask of them to create a space for us to stay during lunch breaks because we have a hard time staying outside of school in breaktime,” a student from Sale, Rabat’s neighboring city, stated in a video during the protest on Wednesday morning. Students expressed difficulty waking up at dawn to attend school, and parents remain concerned about how to sync their schedule with their children’s new timetable. Public schools usually open at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. with a 2 hour-lunch break from 12 noon to 2 p.m. The ministry said in a statement that students will follow the same time-table for school this week when students returned from the fall break. Beginning Monday, November 12, students will follow the new-time table that the government set on November 1. Urban schools will start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1 and 3 p.m. from Monday to Friday. For schools in rural areas, students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3 p.m. with a 30-minute lunch break from Monday to Friday. For schools with two teachers sharing a classroom, the ministry gave alternate time-tables. The altered time tables mean students will have less time at school but will not have to attend school in the dark. Schools will go back to the traditional time-table in the spring.

Rabat – In a press conference after the cabinet’s weekly meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi commented on King Mohammed VI’s Green March speech and his offer to Algeria for a “frank and a direct” dialogue to solve regional issues that hinder Maghreb unity.  El Khalfi announced the government’s mobilization to implement the “historic” and “bold” initiative based on Morocco’s extended hand to Algeria to put in place a framework of bilateral cooperation. In his speech on Tuesday, the King referred to the “division and lack of unity in the Maghreb.” “This unreasonable situation is utterly inconsistent with the brotherly bonds uniting our peoples, who share the same religion, language, history and destiny,” he added. The King also described Moroccan-Algerian ties as “not normal” and “much less than acceptable,” calling for more cooperation and direct dialogue. El Khalfi said that future Moroccan-Algerian cooperation should be built on their common past, marked by the fight of the two people against colonization. In his speech, King Mohammed VI said that the two countries “together fought colonial rule for many years until independence was obtained. We know each other very well, and many Moroccan and Algerian families are united by the bonds of marriage and kinship.” El Khalfi said that the issues which come under the scope of the United Nations, a reference to the Western Sahara conflict, will follow their own process. King Mohammed VI’s proposal is to lay the foundation for another concrete process without conditions or exceptions and in good faith.   During his speech, the King said that Morocco is ready to receive any “proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations.” Morocco and Algeria share the world’s longer closed land border. Algeria has not yet issued any official statement about its position on the King’s offer.

Rabat – The reliability test “is one more step in the start-up of the facility, which is nearing commercial operation and final delivery to the client,” Sener wrote in a statement on November 7. On September 26, Sener announced it would start final testing of Morocco’s Noor III solar power plant in Ouarzazate to prepare for commercial operation. Sener completed the first synchronization of the Noor III plant to the Moroccan grid in August. The company is expecting to deliver the plant by the end of 2018. “With this reliability test, which ran for ten straight days, Noor Ouarzazate III has demonstrated its ability to output its rated power to the grid under changing weather conditions, and even after sunset,” wrote Sener. The plant’s central receiver with a molten salt storage system will enable Noor III to produce electricity without sunlight for 7.5 hours. According to Sener, the plant added over 13.2 gigawatts to the grid during the 10-day test. The plant will be able to supply enough electricity for 120,000 households and save 130,000 tons of CO2 per year. Noor III is a 150 megawatt thermal tower plant which spans 750 hectares and is expected to supply 500 gigawatt hours per year. The Noor III plant is part of the Noor project in the Sahara desert, 10 kilometers northeast of Ouarzazate, in central Morocco. “Once operational, it will mark a turning point in the [solar power station] (CSP) sector worldwide,” said Anas Raisuni, Sener’s regional managing director in Morocco. The Noor project has three phases and four parts: Noor I, Noor II, Noor III, and Noor IV. Noor CSP plants can store solar energy in the form of heated molten salt, allowing the plants to produce electricity into the night. The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) has been managing the solar complex project along with ACWA Power, as part of Morocco’s Noor Solar Plan, the leading solar energy project in the MENA region. Sener was founded in 1956 and has more than 2,500 professionals in its centers in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa. Sener has been involved in 29 solar plants in Spain, the US, South Africa, and Morocco. Sener’s solar plants have an installed capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts and save more than 1 million tons of CO2 emissions a year. In 2017, the group’s operating revenue exceeded €766 million.

The projects, which were approved this year, aim to support income-generating projects for rights holders, said Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit on Wednesday, November 7. Laftit was speaking at a presentation on a draft sectoral budget of the Ministry of the Interior at the House of Representatives, Maghreb Arab Press reported. Communal land, Laftit said, is a lever for development not only for the rights holders, but also for the state, considering the land’s undeniable role in economic and social development and investment promotion. On Wednesday, the minister indicated that the interior ministry is constantly taking measures to identify and ensure the registration of communal lands for management and development. The focus is primarily to identify and register land until land titles are established. An estimated 15 million hectares in Morocco are communal lands. Laftit explained that the government has identified 450 communes to be titled on an overall area of ​​336,664 hectares.  The procedure established 341 lists of rights holders to receive land titles and 123 agricultural lands on 59,000 hectares.  Laftit noted that the interior ministry’s efforts are currently focused on speeding up the pace of land titling, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture. In his speech at the opening of Parliament for the new legislative year on October 12, King Mohammed VI emphasized the importance of using communal agricultural land for investment projects in farming. It would “serve as a powerful lever for improved economic and social conditions, especially for rights holders.” “This should make it possible to secure at least one million additional hectares of this land,” the King said.

Rabat – Jean Marc Fedida, Lamjarred’s lawyer, had requested the singer be released on bail. The Moroccan singer is facing two pending cases of rape from two women in France. The most recent allegation came in August when French police put Lamjarred under formal investigation for the alleged rape of a woman in a hotel in Saint-Tropez in southeast France. Following the Saint-Tropez incident, Lamjarred paid €150,000 bail and left jail on probation. On September 18, Lamjarred went back to jail following the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal’s decision after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed Lamjarred’s release. The 33-year-old singer has faced three previous rape accusations. In 2010, he was accused of rape in New York. US prosecutors later dropped the case when the complainant withdrew.  French police arrested Lamjarred in October 2016, and a Paris court charged him for “aggravated rape” in case brought by Laura Prioul. The case is still pending trial. Lamjarred spent six months in detention in Paris until April 2017.

The statement added that dialogue would be beneficial to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries. Qatar also hopes that the King’s offer will be the beginning of a constructive and fruitful dialogue, according to  Qatar’s daily newspaper the Peninsula. France also issued a statement to commend the King’s speech delivered on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March on Tuesday. The spokeswoman of the French foreign ministry, Agnes von der Muhll, said that France “has always called for the strengthening of ties between Morocco and Algeria which are major partners to which we have exceptionally deep connections.” Morocco’s initiative also received applause from the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. The spokesperson of the UNSG, Stephane Dujarric, said that Guterres “has always been very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco.”  Spain has also backed the King’s proposal. Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell described King Mohammed VI’s offer as “great news.” He said the proposal will “strengthen the relationship and regional integration between two very important countries, which are neighbors, friends and strategic partners of Spain.” Three days have passed since the King made his offer to Algeria. Morocco’s eastern neighbour has remained silent, although some Algerian media speculate a positive answer will come from Bouteflika’s government.

The chairman of MASEN, Mustapha Bakkoury, and the president of the AFDB, Akinwumi Adesina, outlined the details of the program on Wednesday in Johannesburg.  The program’s objective is to promote renewable energy technologies “best suited to their natural conditions and specific energy needs” in Morocco.  The partnership was developed within the framework of the African Investment Forum, meeting now in Johannesburg. It will combine MASEN expertise in renewable energy with the AFDB’s background in capacity building, technical experience, and capital.  “Sharing the experience developed by MASEN and setting in motion a process of competitive development of renewable energy on the African continent is to aim to make renewable energy a real lever for inclusive growth,” Bakkoury said.  He added that Morocco is one of the leading “examples” of renewable energy development in Africa.  Morocco’s Finance Minister Mohamed Benchaaboun and the president of the General Business Confederation of Morocco (CGEM) also attended the signing ceremony, highlighting the importance of the agreement. The deal signals the AFDB’s continued support of Morocco’s push towards renewable energy, with commitments of over $1 billion per year, 80 percent of which is focused on solar, wind, and hydropower. Moroccan officials have previously stated they hope to increase the nation’s consumption of renewable energy to over 52 percent of total energy consumption by 2030.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, welcomed the royal speech the King gave on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. Sheikh Abdullah commended the King’s initiative to establish a political mechanism for dialogue and consultation with Algeria. The Moroccan-Algerian border, closed since 1991, is the longest closed land border in the world. Sheikh Abdullah said that holding a comprehensive and frank dialogue will help establish constructive and positive communications in a way that will help clear the air in the Arab world. The minister affirmed that, through its historic commitment to support joint Arab action, the UAE is determined to help strengthen cooperation and historical ties between the countries of the Arab Maghreb. The Emirates also backs Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara. Algerian media outlets expressed satisfaction with the King’s speech. TSA said that King Mohammed VI’s speech “has a positive tone for the first time.” Spain has also shown support for King Mohammed VI’s offer of dialogue with Algeria.

Tangier – Speaking at wide-ranging panel on Morocco’s relations with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Tavares argued that full-fledged collaboration with Nigeria is the missing ingredient in Morocco’s West African recipe. The panel, which discussed new paradigms on regional integration and South-South momentum to come to terms with emerging challenges in developing countries, highlighted the enormous socio-economic advantages of regionalization and strong intra-African cooperation in this “age of disruption.” While other panelists noted the historical and economic aspects of Morocco-ECOWAS prospects, the Cape Verdean diplomat pointed out the unmistakable weight of diplomacy in convincing “reticent countries.”  Whatever Morocco does next with regards to its continental and regional aspirations, it cannot afford not to engage with Nigeria. Morocco, Tavares argued, should ensure that its “excellent and dynamic diplomacy is focused on convincing Nigeria of the benefits of Morocco’s membership.” Full of praise for Morocco’s “highly-trained human resources,” especially its “competent and exemplary diplomats,” he said that the benefits of Morocco’s membership outweigh its potential costs for the region.  But for all the socio-economic benefits and the unmistakable value that Morocco will bring to the regional table, Rabat, Tavares warned, should take nothing for granted. The Cape Verdean diplomat’s suggestion, as he later confirmed in an interview with Morocco World News, is that an unconvinced Nigeria can undermine all the momentum that Rabat’s soft power has been gathering in the Francophone part of the region. As some originally reticent countries have pledged support for Morocco, what Moroccan diplomats now need is to wholeheartedly engage with their Nigerian counterparts, he told Morocco World News. But what does that mean in practice? Does the Western Sahara question continue to play a substantial role in Lagos’s half-hearted inclination towards Morocco? “Western Sahara is completely irrelevant in an ECOWAS debate,” the Cape Verdean firmly offered.  He continued: “In practical terms, engaging with Nigeria means inviting Nigerian businessmen and policymakers to Morocco for a roundtable or a forum such as [MEDays] to candidly discuss about all the common challenges and opportunities. Convincing Nigeria is the final step, and it really is key to Morocco’s admission in ECOWAS.” Tavares’s remarks have been made before, although in a more technical and less direct wording. In a study published in August, Fitch Solutions assessed the “uncertainty” and “serious obstacles” facing Morocco’s ECOWAS bid. Fearful that Morocco could unsettle regional power balances, Nigeria so far disapproves Rabat’s admission in the West African club.

Tangier – The panel, part of the MEDays forum in Tangier (November 7-10), touched on South-South cooperation, Morocco’s African agenda, and the growing continental push towards locally engineered economic prosperity.   Under the forum’s general theme, “In the Age of Disruption: Finding the New Paradigms,” panelists discussed some of the most fundamental crises facing the world. The topics included immigration, the rise of populism, and the need for South-South and intra-African interconnections in an “unprecedentedly transitioning world.”  “Why, when, and how should Morocco join ECOWAS?” the moderator asked panelists at the plenary session of the MEDays forum on November 8.  Almost all panelists stressed the special and historical ties between Morocco and the countries in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Between Morocco and West Africa, they constantly elaborated, the economic and historical connections are such that Morocco should already consider itself a member state.  They argued that more than a mere act of adhesion to a regional economic body, accepting Morocco’s ECOWAS membership application is a required formality to institutionalize an already tangible reality. Morocco is the largest African investor in the region, making its membership bid “desirable” and mutually beneficial, they suggested. But why, as a North African country, is Morocco legitimate for membership in the West African trade bloc? Because “Morocco has been engaging with West Africa since the 11th century,” began Moubarack Lo, former foreign minister of Senegal and special advisor to prime minister of Senegal. The founding family of Marrakech also helped establish a kingdom in Senegal, he explained. The centuries-old interconnections aside, however, Lo highlighted that Morocco’s newfound mantle as a promoter of inter and intra-African connection is far from a new reality. People tend to forget that Morocco was one of the foremost pioneers of African unity and integration in the aftermath of African states’ independence in the 1960s.  “People also tend to forget that Morocco was among the most avant-gardist countries that defended the idea of African federation. The Casablanca bloc was the offensive group that stood by African unity and argued that we should not allow room for a balkanized Africa.” But it is not all about history. Morocco’s ECOWAS membership would have enormous economic returns for the body.  “If Morocco joins ECOWAS, the body will immediately become the world’s 15th economy in terms of GDP. And according to my own estimations, ECOWAS will be among the world’s leading ten economies by 2030,” Lo explained. Others, less historically inclined than the former chief of Senegalese diplomacy, hinted at the “requirements of our complex and globalized world.” As the world moves on, new realities should emerge to embrace the changes and discard the “old and irrelevant certainties of the past.” “The world has changed. Morocco and ECOWAS desire to work together to face the challenges and share the opportunities of globalization,” said Thomas Boni Yayi, former president of Benin. “So, Morocco’s bid to join ECOWAS is about sharing responsibilities, which is a requirement of a globalized world.” Moussa Mara, former prime minister of Mali, agreed. Beyond the economic and historic foundations that favor Morocco’s ECOWAS aspirations, Mara argued, there is the political necessity of creating strong intra-African platforms to face the daunting challenges of a digitized global economy. “It is a question of continental unity,” Mara said. He explained, “Accepting Morocco in the ECOWAS family will be the concretization of our South-South momentum. The ultimate aim is to collectively benefit from each other’s comparative advantages.” Barring the basic diplomatic protocol that such a gathering of high-profile officials would require, the language of panelists was mostly effusive, pointing to a nascent urge to formally acknowledge a longstanding relationship.  As they spoke, panelists—in the fervor of their tones and the genuineness of their recognition of Morocco’s implication in development projects in West Africa—evinced an extreme level of gratitude to an avowed and committed partner.  Between Morocco and ECOWAS, they seemed to suggest, the marriage—and not one of convenience—is sincere and old. The wedding was celebrated a long time ago. But it needs to be consummated. But under what terms will the relationship be consolidated? And, most importantly, when? Where will Morocco and ECOWAS be one year from now? Are there prospects of change, or will we be speaking—again—of Morocco’s membership bid? “Had all of this boiled down to a personal decision, I would have said let’s end all of this ‘here and now,’” said Boni. But, the former Beninese president conceded, there is a formal roadmap to follow. The formal procedures, regardless of the sincerity of the pro-Morocco ardor in the crushing majority of ECOWAS member states, will take time.  “Morocco is not in a rush,” interjected Brahim Fassi Fihri, president of the Amadeus Institute, the organizing body of the MEDays forum. “There is complete mobilization, but we are still waiting for the negotiation phase. Morocco knows the value of consultation and negotiations. We are not rushing at all,” Fihri added. In October, a three-member independent committee reviewed the legality of Morocco’s bid. They have already delivered their verdict, according to panelists.  Referring to the legal review of Morocco’s bid, ECOWAS parliament President Moustapha Cisse Lo said, “We already have the results of the study. We will convene next month in Abuja to deliver on the question.”

Rabat- Alisha and Katie Lax from North East England will fly with their mother Lorraine Lax to Morocco. Their mission will consist mainly of increasing charitable donations to raise money and collect clothes for orphans. The country’s strict adoption policy forces abandoned children into orphanages. The total estimated number of orphans in Morocco is 30,000 according to the High Commission for Planning. Enfance Espoir Maroc orphanage will host the 12-year-old twins, along with Miss County Durham Galaxy, Natasha Beaston and Miss County Durham Galaxy, Kayleigh Atkinson.  Established in 1995, the orphanage houses abandoned newborns and needy children.  “I think the girls will realize how fortunate people in this country are as there are lots of things we take for granted that people overseas simply don’t have. Katie and Alisha have done fundraising events in the past but this is on a much bigger scale,” the twin’s mother told the British Northern Echo. Following in the footsteps of an older sister, who has competed in Miss Teen Great Britain and Miss Teen International, The identical twins have competed in national and international beauty pageants and will take part in Spain and Florida in 2019.

Rabat – The number accounts for about 85 percent of the overall applications from foreign nationals in Morocco. Laftit noted that, in line with royal directives, regularized migrants must renew their residence permits after three years, provided they have not broken any laws. A ministerial commission charged with overseeing the new migration and asylum strategy carries out regularization, said Laftit.  The Ministry of the Interior has also taken steps to improve the “voluntary return program” by signing agreements with the International Organization for Migration.  By September 2018, authorities had thwarted some 68,000 illegal immigration attempts to Europe this year and dismantled 122 migration networks. Since 2002, the government has dismantled over 3,300 migrant smuggling networks and seized 2,000 boats carrying undocumented immigrants.

Rabat – While Algeria remains silent, Spain has backed the King’s offer to Algeria of a “frank and direct” dialogue to solve regional issues, including the Western Sahara conflict. In a November 8 tweet, Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell described King Mohammed VI’s offer as a “great news.”  He said that the King’s proposal will “strengthen the relationship and regional integration between two very important countries, which are neighbors, friends and strategic partners of Spain.” On Tuesday, King Mohammed VI said that diplomatic ties between Morocco and Algeria are “not normal” and “much less than acceptable.” He said the situation requires frank dialogue to move towards unity in the Maghreb. According to the UN Secretary-General’s spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, Guterres “has always been very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco.”  The League of Arab States Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also supported the King’s speech and his offer to Algeria. Gheit said in a statement on Thursday that King Mohammed VI’s offer will “enable the opening of a new horizon in the relations between the two countries and open the door to improve the amposphere at the level of the Arab Maghreb Union.” He added that the offer will strengthen cooperation in both North Africa and the Sahel-Saharan region, especially to address terrorism and organized crime. Gran noticia el ofrecimiento del Rey Mohamed VI de #Marruecos a #Argelia de establecer mecanismo político de consultas y cooperación para fortalecer la relación y la integración regional entre dos países tan relevantes, que son vecinos, amigos y socios estratégicos de #España. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) November 8, 2018  In the absence of an official response from the Algerian government, an Algerian diplomat speaking anonymously said that Algeria will accept King Mohammed VI’s offer for enhanced dialogue based on certain conditions. The demands would include: the “end  of diplomatic and media propaganda campaigns between the two countries;  the end of the flow of drugs into Algeria; good neighborliness and a comprehensive settlement through dialogue; and neutralizing the conflict of Western Sahara and keeping it within the context of the auspices of the United Nations.” Algerian media, including TSA, also wrote positively about the King’s speech and his offer to Algeria. It remains to be seen whether Bouteflika’s government will officially respond to the royal speech.

The two-day Morocco-France Business Forum saw more than 100 French investors headed to Laayoune for the third annual forum November 2-4. At the opening ceremony of the forum on November 2, French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Morocco (CFCIM) Chairman Philippe-Edern Klein spoke about Morocco’s efforts to develop Western Sahara. He said that the Laayoune-Sakia-El Hamra region has rapidly transformed in recent years, calling it an “ideal hub” for investments. “The region of the South benefits from ambitious investment programs, both public and private, and major infrastructure projects that make it the ideal hub to the African continent,” he said. Maha Hmeid, director of the Moroccan branch of Weber, a subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain group, told AFP that the French firm is planning to open a unit in the region after those opened in Casablanca and Agadir. Secretary of State to the Ministry of Industry Rakia Edderham told AFP that Laayoune is a “very rich region: There is great potential in industry, fishing, agriculture or offshoring, we want to see foreign investors coming.” The forum aimed to convince French businessman to invest in the region, which Morocco is developing for Sahrawis. Hamdi Ould Errachid, president of the region, said that Morocco aims to push the development and economy to shed light on the attractiveness of the territory, a gate to sub-Saharan Africa. Asked about the Western Sahara conflict, Eddarham said that the “political issue should be solved by the United Nations … the development of the region cannot be linked to it.” Khadija Gamraoui, a right-wing French lawmaker, who attended the forum with a Moroccan-French political association, said, “No one is fooled…. There are politics at stake.” However, she said she was impressed by development projects in the region.

Rabat – A statement from Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) said today that the suspects, aged 25 and 18, were planning a terrorist attack to undermine the stability of the country. Information from Morocco’s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) made the arrests possible. The suspects, according to the press release, have links with the members of a terror cell arrested in July in Fez and Safi. The suspects and the previously arrested members were allegedly coordinating to obtain weapons to commit terror attacks on sensitive locations across the country. An initial investigation showed that the suspects also have links with ISIS outside the country to learn how to make explosive devices. One of the suspects had previously been arrested in accordance to the law against terrorism  The statement said that the suspects were put in custody to investigate connections to further possible suspects. Today’s arrests followed the arrest of an engineering student with alleged ties to ISIS in Mohammedia. The BCIJ said that the suspect “was planning a terrorist attack to undermine the stability of the country by using an explosive belt.” BCIJ has arrested a number of members  of alleged terror cells with links to ISIS. In July, BCIJ officials arrested seven pro-ISIS extremists operating in central Morocco, near Agadir and Marrakech. In the same month, BCIJ arrested four suspects in four Moroccan cities: Casablanca, Nador, Tangier, and Tiznit. Ever since the Marrakech terror attack in 2011, Morocco has modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime. In October, BCIJ Chief Abdelhak Khiame told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that Morocco has dismantled 183 terror cells since 2002. Fifty-one out of the 57 cells dismantled since 2015 were allegedly connected with ISIS. “The strength of Morocco in the fight against terrorism is mainly due to the close collaboration between the various services responsible for ensuring security,” said Khiame.

Rabat – During his stay in Marrakech, Jesus Greus began developing the dictionary in collaboration with several Marrakchis, primarily with Arabic professor Naima Lahrach. Jesus Greus was born in Madrid in 1954 to a family that instilled him with an appreciation for culture. He left Spain for London to obtain a degree in English language and culture at the Chartered Institute of Linguists. Greus then moved to Marrakech where he wrote many of his literary works. The ochre city became an adventure that stimulated his curiosity and inspired him to write. He wrote one of his best-known books, “Zyriab,” in Marrakech. While living in Marrakech, Greus excelled in learning Darija, which instigated the idea to create a Spanish-Darija dictionary. Knowing Darija helped him to mingle easily with the locals which served his writing well. “For the years that I lived in Marrakech, I made the effort to learn Moroccan Darija. I must respect those with whom I live as well as their culture,” he told Aujourdhui.ma.  “Life in the Medina is like a small village, I know everyone here, people greet each other every morning, I buy antibiotics for the waste collector, I invite neighbors to my house and vice versa, I chat with the grocer, the hairdresser, with the people at the pressing and with the boy who sells the cigarettes, wonderful.”

Rabat – The RNP will then conduct a census for the remaining regions between February 2020 and May 2024,  Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit said Wednesday. The RNP aims to collect personal data to ensure the government has reliable data through the use of a digital identifier for all Moroccans, including minors and Moroccans residing abroad, said Laftit. Laftit was speaking at a presentation on a draft sectoral budget of the Ministry of the Interior at the House of Representatives, Maghreb Arab Press reported. On August 27, Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior and India’s Bangalore-based Institute of Technology signed an MoU to work jointly on a social register project. RNP’s management system is based on the open source software platform, called “MOSIP.” The registration project, which the World Bank has helped finance with $100 million, is set to identify the needs and aspirations of Morocco’s most marginalized families. To ensure good governance and reform of social protection systems, Laftit said that the registration system will based on three pillars. The first pillar focuses on RNP, and the second focuses on the Consolidated Social Register (RSU), which includes social and economic information to determine families in need of social services. The RSU is the only way for citizens to access all social programs on the basis of objective criteria according to socio-economic data and new technologies, explained Laftit. The RSU register will be put into general use between March 2020 and June 2024. The third pillar is the establishment of a public institution, the National Register Agency, which will manage the security of the technical system and the confidentiality of registers. The registration project is a priority for the Moroccan government because it reflects the instructions King Mohammed VI gave in his Throne Day speech. The King spoke about a new initiative to establish a “consolidated social register” to gradually improve social welfare projects.   “This is a national registration system to identify families that truly deserve to benefit from social assistance programs,” the King said. “It is a strategic and ambitious social project which concerns large segments of the Moroccan population,” he added. Laftit  also indicated that his ministry is working to monitor the national campaign for the registration of children who were not registered in the civil registry at birth. The campaign was launched in December 2017. More than 33,430 people had been registered by the end of June, the minister noted.

Rabat – The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered Belkacem’s Belgian nationality to be stripped on October 23, saying he represents a permanent threat to public security and breached his obligations as a Belgian citizen. Belkacem was jailed in 2015 as the leader of the “Sharia4Belgium” group that recruited jihadists, dozens of whom went to Syria. Belkacem’s lawyer, Liliane Verjauw, confirmed Belkacem’s appeal to the Belgian outlet Belga News Agency. The lawyer, however, did not specify which elements of the judgment her client will appeal, but said they have one month to build their case. Verjauw added that she will do everything she can to bring the case before the European Court of Human Rights. Fouad Belkacem received 27 convictions in the police court and 9 in the correctional court. He has been charged with robbery, threats, destruction, rebellion, defamation, racism, harassment, and violation of honor and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Rabat – The diplomat’s position is unofficial since Ageria has not yet expressed its stance on the royal speech in which King Mohammed VI invited Morocco’s eastern neighbor to engage in a “frank and direct” dialogue with Morocco to solve regional issues that hamper Maghreb unity. In an interview with Al Araby Al Jadeed, the Algerian diplomat said that Algeria will accept King Mohammed VI’s proposal. But the move will require a “phase of confidence building to lay down clear and binding bases for understanding.” The diplomat also explained that Algeria has four demands Morocco must meet before re-establishing bilateral ties is possible. Algeria’s preconditions include the “end  of diplomatic and media propaganda campaigns between the two countries;  the end of the flow of drugs into Algeria; good neighborliness and a comprehensive settlement through dialogue; and neutralizing the conflict of Western Sahara and keeping it within the context of the auspices of the United Nations.” No bilateral talks on Western Sahara  He added that Algeria is firm in its position against any bilateral talks on Western Sahara, because it is an issue that should be solved at the UN. The source added that Algeria considers itself as an “observer and a neighburing country to the conflict only.” The last demand is the one Morocco may find the most objectionable as the North African country is mobilizing its diplomacy internationally to defend its position. Algeria, which backs Polisario, has denied playing a main role in the conflict. Instead, Algeria says it is an observer party, saying that the conflict should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. Morocco, however, will likely not agree to negotiate with Polisario because it considers the separatist group as an illegitimate representative of the Sahrawi population in Tindouf, Algeria, and in Western Sahara. Morocco’s offer to involve Algeria in the UN-led political process received a nod in the latest resolution of the Security Council. On October 31, the Security Council voted for Resolution 2440, which urged Algeria to be involved in the political process and to contribute to a possible agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution. Algerian drugs also a problem in Morocco In 2017 and  2018, Algeria directly accused Morocco of “flooding” it with drugs. While Algeria blames Morocco for drug issues, Morocco has long complained of the high numbers of psychotropic tablets smuggled in from Algeria that Moroccan authorities have seized. In 2017, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that seizures of psychotropic pills from Algeria “witnessed a very alarming rise over the past years.” Morocco also offer security cooperation from Algeria to combat drug trafficking at the borders, including in the Sahel region. Morocco’s demand for intensified cooperation was echoed by King Mohammed VI in his Tuesday speech for Green March Day. The King also left the door open for any “initiative Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations.”

Rabat – The exhibit combines Laabi’s paintings and poetry as a marriage of words and images. Laabi joins the “literati” ideal of poetry and the ecstasy of the image to create masterpieces. Laabi’s poetry gives a voice to his paintings and the paintings display Laabi’s poetic words. Most of Laabi’s poems inspire his painting. Abdellatif Laabi is a prize-winning Moroccan poet who received the prestigious French Goncourt Prize for poetry in 2009 and the French Academy’s Grand prix de la Francophonie in 2011. On painting, Laabi has said, “I observed many painters, saw them during their work, I sat on contemplating the way they worked, and sometimes wrote about their works; the art of painting became familiar and intimate to me, and in a very short time, I began to paint whenever I could, daily and for several hours.”  On what inspires him, Laabi writes in “My Story with Painting” that “Mankind is always reborn as one gradually discovers his or her different selves and multifaceted aspects through the unexpected encounters, the emotions, the mutations we experience, and the danger we face.” Laabi, a major figure in Moroccan culture, is a prolific artist, poet, novelist, playwright, and translator.

Rabat – About 100 people were at the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, when the shooting took place at around 11:20 p.m., according to local authorities. The dance bar was hosting an event for college students. Twelve people have died, and many were injured. The shooter, also dead, has not yet been identified. One of the eyewitnesses, Matt Wennerstrom, 20, told the press that the hooded attacker first started to shoot at employees before moving on to shoot at random people.  “I grabbed as many people as I could and pulled them down underneath the pool table we were close to until he ran out of bullets for that magazine and had to reload,” Wennerstrom stated. Police said the attacker might have used smoke bombs at the scene. Approaching the scene of Borderline.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communications responded, “The ranking of Freedom House is devoid of accuracy and objectivity.” The NGO’s annual Freedom on the Net report for 2018 was released on November 1. The report noted the government’s crackdown on online news outlets and imprisoning of journalists and activists for their involvement in the Hirak protests in Al Hoceima. The research mentions Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, editor in chief of news site Badil Info. A Moroccan court sentenced El Mahdaoui to 3 years in prison in June for “inciting participation in banned [Hirak] protests” and “threatening national security.” In response to Freedom House, the ministry’s communications department stressed that the report presented inaccurate and biased information, maintaining that it had failed to present arguments and include the “positive” indicators that would rank Morocco higher among countries with digital freedom. The report addressed the difficulty of creating a news website in Morocco, recalling the Ministry of Communications’ refusal to grant press cards to Mohamed Ezzouak, founder of Yabiladi, and Ali Amar, founder of Le Desk. The ministry responded by emphasizing that under the “legal protection of confidentiality of sources,” the press and publishing law guarantees the practice of journalism. The ministry also noted that there were 349 electronic newspapers in Morocco in 2017, compared with 98 in 2015. Regarding freedom of the press in Morocco, the report says that the state can shut down publications “prejudicial to Islam, the monarchy, territorial integrity, or public order” and issue prison sentences and heavy fines on publishers of infringing content.  The ministry stressed that the freedom of the digital press is “constitutionally guaranteed,” and freedom to create news sites is reflected in the increase of “the number of portals ending with ‘.ma,’ which jumped from 73 in 2016 to 129 in 2017.” The report found that despite the state’s strong control over media content, it did not block or filter any political, social, or religious websites or other sites discussing controversial issues. The ministry agreed, saying the state did not register any case of ban or seizure this year. Morocco is distinguished by its diversity and “total freedom” to launch e-papers, the ministry stated.  The report monitored the internet freedom in Morocco from June 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018. According to the research, not much has changed since the 2017 report as Morocco maintained its score, 45 out of 100.

Rabat – Despite a sign reading “Notice of Death of Candidate,”  voters still elected Hof, the 72-year-old brothel-owner running as a Republican. Here’s the polling notice in Pahrump today informing voters that GOP Assembly candidate Dennis Hof is deceased but still appears on the ballot. If Hof wins, county commissions from the 3 counties that the district covers will appoint a replacement from the same party #nvleg pic.twitter.com/p8mjPBIwzz — Riley Snyder (@RileySnyder) 6 novembre 2018  Hof, who died on October 16, defeated Democrat Lesia Romanov with 63 percent of the vote on Tuesday. Hof had already won the Republican primary for Nevada’s 36th Assembly District four months before his death. The district includes rural communities and large desert areas.  By Hof’s death, his name had already been sent to the midterm election ballots, and it was too late to change them. Hof’s slogan, inspired by President Trump’s famous quote, was “Make Nevada, Nevada Again.” Voters reportedly knew that the county officials would appoint another Republican to take Hof’s place. Also running in US midterm elections Tuesday, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar made history as the first Muslim women to become US congresswomen. Tlaib, born to Palestinian immigrants in Detroit, Michigan, won over Michigan’s 13th congressional district on a progressive platform. Tlaib has secured the seat formerly occupied by Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers. Omar, a Somali-American who fled civil war in Somalia at the age of 14 and lived in the US as a refugee, has secured a seat formerly occupied by Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison. With 223 seats, Democrats won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives in midterm elections on Tuesday, over 197 seats won by Republicans.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The briefing detailed one large irregular migration network composed of 20 leaders which intelligence services dubbed the “schleuser lodge.” The report said the network was the main trafficker of migrants along western Mediterranean routes beginning in early 2017.  Irregular migration from Morocco to Europe has increased 150 percent since 2014 on average. The networks usually take one of three different crossing routes from Morocco to Spain; through the strait of Gibraltar, through the sea of Alboran in the western Mediterranean, and on the Atlantic from Larache to Cadiz.  The smuggling network charges migrants €1,000 for up to three attempted crossings and an additional €2,000 for safe shelter in Spain if they cross successfully. In the event a migrant dies attempting to cross, the network returns the money to their family.  Morocco has become a popular destination for sub-Saharan migrants hoping to make it to Europe, due to its proximity to Europe and the fact that many do not need a visa to enter Morocco. In early October a Spanish news outlet reported that Spain had repeatedly expressed Morocco’s concerns regarding irregular migration to the EU in an effort to provide the country with extra resources to curb such attempts and dismantle trafficking networks. In September the Moroccan Navy faced criticism after firing on a go-fast migrant boat attempting to reach Spain, subsequently killing Hayat Belkacem, a 20-year-old Moroccan woman, and wounding three other migrants.  Authorities are also cracking down on land, entering neighborhoods populated by migrants and sometimes forcing relocation. “The police in Tangier were brutal. They entered our homes, cracked down on sub-Saharans, and arrested us regardless of whether you are a [legally resident] student or irregular migrant,” one Guinean migrant named Alpha told Morocco World News. Regardless of such measures, it is unclear what, if anything will persuade migrants to stop trying to make the journey north and relinquish their hopes to achieve the “European dream.”

Rabat – The Secretary-General’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said that Guterres “has always been very supportive of increased dialogue between Algeria and Morocco.” The two neighboring countries share the world’s longest closed border. Dujarric made his remarks at a press briefing on Wednesday in response to a journalist’s question about King Mohammed VI’s proposal. On Tuesday, King Mohammed VI delivered a speech on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March. In his speech, The King said that Morocco is open to “any proposals and initiatives from Algeria” to re-establish bilateral ties. He added that the bilateral ties between Algeria and Morocco are “not normal” and “much less than acceptable.” The King also called for a political mechanism “to analyze all pending issues in good faith and in a very frank, objective and honest way, using an open-ended agenda, without conditions or exceptions.” “I should like to stress that Morocco is willing to consider the proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations,” said the King. Dujarric also said that Guterres “welcomes” the support of King Mohammed VI for the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who invited all parties for talks in Geneva December 5-6. The UN chief also commended the “parties and neighbours for responding positively to the invitation of Mr. Kohler for an initial roundtable” to discuss the Western Sahara conflict. According to Dujarric, Guterres also hoped that “this initial roundtable will be the beginning of a process that will lead to a solution of this long-standing conflict.” The roundtable was also highly welcomed by Resolution 2440 adopted by the Security Council on October 31. The resolution has for the first time mentioned Algeria as a party that should contribute and “work constructively” with Kohler to ensure the success of the political process.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – More than 1,500 Muslim scholars from 20 countries met in Istanbul at the IUMS General Assembly on Wednesday, November 7, to elect a new leader and board members and discuss Muslims’ issues around the world. El-Raissouni is known for his controversial statements. He previously condemned Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Qatar, calling for Muslim scholars to reject it as haram (sinful). He explained, “Islam and reason do not accept the siege of any people.” Instead, El-Raissouni was very supportive of Qatari news channel Al Jazeera. “This channel defends the Sunni Muslims in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and other countries. It defends their honor, blood and property. It adopts the issues of the Islamic nation and its persecuted people everywhere,” he said. Ahmed Abdulsalam Mohamed el-Raissouni, who previously served as vice president of IUMS, was born in 1953 in the village of Awlad Sultan in Larache, northern Morocco. He earned his bachelor’s degree in Islamic Law at Al Quaraouiyine University in Fez in 1978.  El-Raissouni went on to get his master’s degree from Mohammed V University in Rabat in 1989 and a Ph.D. degree in 1992. In addition to his role as a founding member and vice president of the World Union of Muslim Scholars, el-Raissouni served on the executive board of the World Forum of Muslim Scholars  and as secretary general of the Association of Graduates of Islamic Studies. From 1994-1996, el-Raissouni was president of the Association of the Islamic Future in Morocco. In the early 2000s, he tried his hand in the news media as editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper Al-Tajdeed 2000 to 2004.

The project “aims to secure access to drinking water through new investments in treatment processes and drinking water supply networks” in Morocco, AfDB wrote in a statement on November 6. The board of directors of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) said it approved the loan on Monday, November 5. The project will target 2.5 million people in Guercif in the northeast, Zagora in the east, Al Hoceima in the north, Tangier, and Beni Mellal in central Morocco. Mohamed El Azizi, the bank’s director-general for the North Africa region, described the bank’s contribution as “strategic.” “Guaranteeing access for all to high-quality drinking water is the prerequisite for any form of sustainable development,” El Azizi said. The program, which plans to ensure sustainable access to drinking water, meets two of the bank’s five highest priorities: “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa” and “Industrialize Africa.” For Leila Farah Mokaddem, the bank’s Morocco country manager, the project “will contribute to further improving the quality of life of millions of Moroccans.” “Taken together with our investments in education, agriculture and energy, it will facilitate the emergence of new poles of development,” Mokaddem added. The project, according to AfDB, is in line with the objectives of the National Emergency Water Sector program and relevant sustainable development goals. The project is also aligned with the priorities set in the 2016-2020 investment plan of Morocco’s National Electricity and Drinking Water Agency (ONEE). In June, the head of ONEE in the Fez region, Mohammed Berkia, said that office is adopting projects to improve the potable water supply in Al Hoceima through 2035. Berkia said the projects would cost an estimated MAD 714 million. The government has budgeted MAD 900 million for the project, which will launch by the end of the year. Berkia’s statements came three weeks after King Mohammed VI instructed the government to build river and hill dams to help alleviate water scarcity in rural Morocco. The King appointed a commission led by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to find appropriate solutions to the problem. The monarch called on the commission to establish desalination plants and to ensure sustainable water in agricultural fields. In March 15, El Othmani announced that the government would introduce a national water plan through 2050 to solve water shortages in Morocco. According to the AfDB, the fifty-year partnership between Morocco and the bank includes more than 160 projects and programs with a total fund of more than $10 billion. More than 80 percent of the funding has been devoted to basic infrastructure in energy, water, transport, agriculture, and social development.

Rabat- El Othmani and Doukkali informed the King of the first steps the inter-ministerial commission has made to improve the Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED) in a meeting at the Royal Palace of Rabat. The King noted the inconsistencies affecting RAMED’s implementation and the need to rectify the country’s ailing healthcare system. In his Throne Day speech, July 29, the King urged ministers to focus on RAMED, suggesting that they should collectively work to correct the country’s health system “characterized by blatant disparities and poor management” and bring positive change for Moroccans. The King pledged to personally supervise the project and remove anything that might hinder its progress. The government plans to cover 90 percent of the Moroccan population with health insurance by 2021. RAMED, which has been in place for six years, and Compulsory Health Insurance (AMO) cover only 60 percent of Moroccans.  More than 25 percent of Moroccans (8.5 million) do not have access to medical care, especially the poor who live in rural areas, according to the World Bank 2017 Economic Memorandum. The quality of healthcare is also affected by the many qualified doctors who emigrate because of the lack of proper infrastructure. In his speech on the opening of the legislative year, October 12, the King proposed that foreign investors in the Moroccan healthcare system share their professional expertise to benefit the country’s youth and increase employment opportunities in all sectors. The King said the proposal would be a win-win because the King suggested opening jobs which are “currently unlicensed for foreigners in the health sector.”  In May, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pledged to support Morocco’s ambition to extend health insurance to low-income and disadvantaged people. The 2011 Constitution dictates equal access of citizens to health care, basic medical coverage, solidarity, health equality, and equal distribution of health resources.

Rabat – On the mention of the migrant caravan during a press conference at the White House following the US midterm elections, Trump started to lose his cool. Thousands of Central American migrants from El Salvator, Honduras, and Guatemala started to journey north towards the US-Mexico border on October 12, fleeing poverty, violence, and persecution.  The president cut off Acosta who thought that Trump had “demonized” migrants by calling them a group of invaders. “Just sit down” and “That’s enough” Trump ordered Acosta. However, as the journalist continued to ignore Trump’s orders, a staffer had to intervene and take the microphone away from Acosta. “I think you should let me run the country. You run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better; CNN should be ashamed of itself.” When Trump gave the word to another reporter, the reporter came to Acosta’s defense saying that he is a “diligent reporter,” making the president as angry as ever. Trump first said that his and Acosta’s opinions are different concerning migration, affirming that migrants should “come to the US legally.” “I want [migration] to be a process, we need the people because we have hundreds of companies moving in,” Trump stated. Of the thousands of caravan migrants, Trump scoffed: “Do you think they were actors?They weren’t actors. They didn’t come from Hollywood.” Trump believes that there are more migrants heading to the borders than shown in the media. According to the Mexican government, there are 3,600 migrants traveling in the caravan.

Rabat- Students in Meknes, Sale, and Ain Borja in Casablanca chose to miss class and stand outside their schools to condemn the country staying on DST (GMT+1) and to call on the Ministry of Education to keep the traditional time-table. “We ask [the government] to remove the daylight saving, and we also ask of them to create a space for us to stay during lunch breaks because we have a hard time staying outside of school in breaktime,” a student from Sale stated in a video during the protest on Wednesday morning.     Public schools usually open at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. with a 2 hour-lunch break from 12 noon to 2 p.m. The ministry said in a statement that students will follow the same time-table for school for half a week starting today after the fall break. Beginning Monday, November 12, students will follow the new-time table that the government set on November 1. Schools will start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1 and 3 p.m. from Monday to Friday. For schools in rural areas, students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3 p.m. with a 30-minute lunch break from Monday to Friday. For schools with two teachers sharing a classroom, the ministry gave alternate time-tables. Schools will go back to the traditional time-table in the spring.On Friday, October 26, the government adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 moving Morocco to GMT+1 year-round.  The surprise announcement came two days before Morocco was set to turn its clocks back to standard time on Sunday, October 28.

Rabat – Sources told Arabic news outlet Rai Al Youm that Morocco had refused to hand over the prince before June. The news outlet reported that Saudi Arabia also asked Morocco to increase surveillance on the prince, who was living in the Casablanca palace of his father, the late King Abdullah. According to the source, Saudi Arabia also asked Morocco to disclose bank accounts and properties owned by the Saudi princes who were jailed in a Saudi Ritz-Carlton hotel last year on the order of Mohammed bin Salman. The source added that Prince Mansour was in Europe when bin Salman ordered the arrest of the Saudi princes. Morocco World News contacted Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi to ask for more details about the news, but he was unreachable. The news outlet added that Morocco’s refusal resulted in a tension between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, affecting Saudi Arabia’s position on Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. On June 14 in Moscow, Saudi Arabia favored the North American bid over Morocco’s campaign to host the 2026 World Cup. Saudi Arabia’s vote and campaign against Morocco raised the eyebrows of many given the diplomatic ties between the two countries. A Saudi sports official close to bin Salman, Turki Al Sheikh, tweeted several times about Saudi Arabia’s decision to vote for United 2026, politicizing the bid. Al Sheikh cited Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf tension between Saudi Arabia’s coalition and Qatar. Rai Al Youm said that Saudi Arabia has stopped asking Morocco to extradite Prince Mansour, especially after the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi agents murdered Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. In 2015, Morocco extradited Saudi Prince Turki bin Bandar, saying he was under an international arrest warrant from Interpol. The Washington Post, however, reported that Interpol denied that it issued a “red notice” for the Saudi prince. Interpol does not issue arrest warrants.

Abdeljalil Labdaoui, president of the Council of the Urban Commune of Safi, announced the new transportation system. A Spanish bus company will oversee the new project, which aims to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of transportation in Safi, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).   Safi’s council initially adopted the plan to integrate eco-friendly buses into Safi’s transportation system during a council session in May 2017.  The new buses, engineered in Germany, are equipped with wifi and surveillance cameras. They also accommodate individuals with special needs.  Starting on January 1, 2019, 45 eco-friendly buses will be introduced to Safi’s transportation system, while 25 of the city’s buses belonging to the Autonomous Urban Transport Authority are currently undergoing repair.  Safi plans to acquire new buses each year, reaching 135 buses in five years.

Rabat – Several videos of Moroccans condemning the death of the young man have gone viral. One video shows people carrying the miner’s body. The miner’s death follows several other accidents in 2017. On December 23, two informal miners were crushed while mining underground in a closed coal mine in Jerada. On February 1, 2018, another informal miner died while extracting coal from an illegal mine near Jerada when the walls of the mine collapsed and killed him. Three others were seriously injured in the accident. The death of miners triggered a wave of protest as relatives, friends, and sympathizers took to Jerada’s streets to protest social disparities, lack of infrastructure, and unemployment. The situation in Jerada escalated following a clash between law enforcement and protesters on March 14, resulting in several injuries among security forces. Before the clash, the Ministry of the Interior released a statement announcing its decision to ban unauthorized sit-ins and protests. Security forces also arrested protesters. Several activists and politicians, including MP Omar Balafrej, condemned the arrests of protesters in Jerada. He said that the “barons” who had been exploiting the coal deposits were the ones who should be held accountable and arrested, referring to council authorities and parliamentarians. In response to the tension, the government pledged development reforms to benefit locals.

By Trista Youssef  Rabat- Rashida Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was born in Detroit, Michigan. She won over Michigan’s 13th congressional district on a progressive platform. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American who fled civil war in Somalia at age 14, won over Minnesota’s fifth congressional district in last night’s elections. Similarly to Tlaib, Omar ran a progressive campaign calling for universal healthcare and affordable university tuition.  Tuesday’s elections made history, with an unprecedented number of minorities and women running for office. Democrats captured a House majority, breaking a four-year Republican stronghold over both chambers of the US Congress. Democrats won 219 seats in the House out of a total of 435 seats. Republicans won 193 seats. In the Senate, 51 seats constitute a majority. The midterm elections resulted in a 51-45 Republican Senate majority. The election results not only mark a demographic shift within the Democratic party, but also an overall shift in political power. President Trump is now expected to face more resistance against his policies in Congress. The president’s legislation on immigration reform, tax cuts, and trade policies are likely to be challenged by Democratic opposition.  Because Democrats will have more money, staff, and political leverage over congressional committees, increased efforts to launch investigations into President Trump’s tax returns, which will contain information on his income and taxes, and his campaign’s involvement with Russia are expected.  Although Democrats hoped for an anti-Trump wave to sweep the country, Republican success in maintaining a Senate majority reveals continuing right wing support among many US citizens.  The midterm outcomes reveal a deep political division across the country. With a split Congress, the US is expected to face legislative gridlock on a wide spectrum of policy matters for the remaining two years of Trump’s four-year term.

The WTO made the announcement in a report published on October 31, criticizing Morocco’s fines on Turkish HRC. In September 2014 Morocco imposed an 11 percent anti-dumping duty on Turkish imports of HRC. Turkey subsequently challenged the tariff in October 2016. Turkey alleged that the fines were inconsistent with a number of provisions in the WTO’s anti-dumping agreement, citing specifically articles 5.10 and 6.8.  Dumping is the practice of a government offloading goods in foreign markets below the price they would usually charge in their domestic marketplace. Governments enact anti-dumping measures as a form of tariff against foreign imports that they deem to be priced below market value.  Morocco has said it considered the duties in question to be in accordance with its domestic laws and with its WTO commitments.

Rabat – LGS Specialty Sales is expecting shipments to arrive in the US from November to April, according to a company statement published by Fresh Fruit Portal. Luke Sears, president and founder of LGS, said that the company is “expecting a large crop” from Morocco and Spain “thanks to a strong growing season.” Sears continued, “This year’s increased volume of Chilean W. Murcotts [mandarins] has allowed us to import fruit of optimum maturity from Spain and Morocco, paving the way for a smooth transition period later in the season.” Spanish and Moroccan clementines, according to Sears, will be “at peak flavor by the second week of December.” Citrus represents a significant source of foreign currency to Morocco’s economy. Morocco exports 500,000 tons of citrus annually with an estimated value of MAD 3 billion per year. The North African country exports 80 percent of its citrus to Russia and the European Union. The remaining 20 percent is exported to North America and the Middle East. Sears also said that his company is planning to transition from clementines to W. Murcotts in January. The company will import a steady volume of Moroccan W. Murcotts through April, with an expectation for “an excellent crop this year, both in yield and in flavor.” For Moroccan clementines, which are imported mainly from Berkane, in northeastern Morocco, the company said they were “added to LGS’ product offerings in the early 2000s.” The company added that Berkane is a fertile area which “was selected specifically for its climate and rootstock, both of which are especially conducive to producing superior citrus.” Over the past 5 years, Morocco produced 2 million tons of citrus in an area of over 125,000 hectares. The New York-based company has been importing and distributing clementines since it was established in 1991. LGS is known as a leading importer to the US of clementines, oranges, avocados, grapes, lemons, minneolas, and persimmons. The company also provides private label clementine packaging for retailers. LGS sells its products in stores and supermarkets in the US.

Macron and the King will inaugurate Morocco’s high-speed train next week, a source from the Elysee Palace told Reuters. The train was originally scheduled to be finished in 2015 but was later postponed to 2017. After a series of delays, however, the project was set to complete in the fall of 2018 and will finally launch next week. Quoting the presidency, Reuters reported that the LGV is a “flagship project of the bilateral relationship” between the two countries. The first of its kind in Africa, the 200-kilometer long LGV will link Casablanca and Tangier in two hours and 15 minutes instead of the usual 5 hour train ride. Several French companies collaborated in the construction and furnishing of the LGV, including SNCF, Alstom, Cegelec, and Ansaldo-Ineo. King Mohammed VI and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the project in 2007.  Construction was launched four years later in 2011. The project cost €2 billion. According to BFMTV, the French government “is engaged in financing 51 percent  through various loans, including one granted by the French development agency of 220 million euros. This cost represents a budget approximately 15% higher than the initial estimate of 1.8 billion euros, calculated in 2007 at the launch of the project.” Morocco received a loan of €80 million from the French Development Agency (AFD) to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high-speed train project in October 2017.  AFD’s loan followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million in 2011 to begin the project. Morocco and France maintain strong diplomatic ties. In the latest expression of the relationship, a French official applauded French-Moroccan cooperation on October 31.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia executed Tuti Tursilawati, a mother of one child, on October 29, seven years after she was found guilty of killing her employer’s father and given the death penalty. Tursilawati had beaten her alleged sexual abuser to death with a stick as she feared being raped, according to a migrant activist group.  Tursilawati fled the scene but was repeatedly raped by nine Saudis before the police took her into custody. All her rapists have been tried separately. Indonesia denounced her execution, saying it was carried out without notifying her family or Indonesian officials in advance. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that she had contacted Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir to express her disapproval, according to the Jakarta Post.  Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, the Indonesian foreign ministry’s director for overseas citizen protection, told local press on Tuesday, October 30, that he had personally delivered the news to Tursilawati’s family on a visit to her hometown in Majalengka, Indonesia. Iqbal added that Tursilawati had not been reacting in self-defense because she wasn’t harassed at the moment she committed the murder. “It is true that Tuti had been harassed, but not when she committed the murder,” said Iqbal. An international law expert from the University of Indonesia, Hikmahanto Juwana, asserted that Saudi Arabia “violated the norms of international relations” by not notifying Indonesia about the execution.

Rabat – Crowley expressed satisfaction with King Mohammed VI move to invite Algeria to engage in a “frank and direct” dialogue with Morocco to solve the regional conflict that has destabilized Maghreb unity. “Since Morocco and Algeria are neighbors, which confront complex disputes without easy solutions, the sovereign’s proposition to engage a dialogue of good faith is certainly welcome,” the former US official told Maghreb Arab Press in Washington, D.C. Crowley added that if Algeria expresses mutual interest, “This will be significant progress forward.” Speaking on the Western Sahara conflict, the former official said that the United Nations has played an important role. “However, it is up to Morocco and Algeria to engage in a direct dialogue to find a solution to this issue and other outstanding issues in order to be able to normalize relations.” Crowley has agreed that the solution for the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Morocco and Algeria and not Polisario, which claims itself a representative of the Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. In his speech, King Mohammed VI on Tuesday addressed a direct message to the Algerian government to cooperate with Morocco to re-establish diplomatic ties between the two countries. During the speech, King Mohammed VI denounced the lack of unity in the Maghreb due to regional conflicts, including the Western Sahara issue. The King said that despite historical bonds between the two countries, including the struggle against colonial rule, the countries’ “bilateral relations are not normal, much less acceptable.” “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” the monarch said.

Rabat- While the unemployment rate for graduates with higher education degrees is double the unemployment rate for the general population, nearly half of university students will not go on to get a degree. The Ministry of Education discussed the statistics at a Parliamentary session on Monday. Moroccan universities currently have 860,000 students, 42 percent of whom are female students and 244,000 of whom are freshmen. Morocco still has a comparatively low rate of students in higher education. Only 37 percent of the Moroccan population aged 18 to 22 choose to enroll in universities, according to the Ministry of Education. The ministry pointed out that 16.5 percent of university students drop out in their first year and 8.1 percent drop out in the third. Some dropouts, 7.8 percent, choose to leave for smaller training institutions.  Over the past five years, student enrollment has increased by 42 percent. However, the number of professors has only increased 17 percent and available seats in classrooms only 28 percent. Morocco will need to employ 2,488 university professors to join new educational institutions to prevent overcrowding because of the 18 percent increase in baccalaureate graduates. The higher education and scientific research sector, with a budget of MAD 11.3 billion according to the 2019 Finance Bill, is experiencing a decline in student costs over the past years, from MAD 14,000 per student in 2013 to MAD 11,000 in 2017.  The government allocated MAD 70 billion in 2018 specifically to improve material resources and educational quality for university students. The move was part of the strategic vision of the 2015-2030 reform program and in accordance with the 2016-2021 Government Action Program. According to a previous press statement by Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi the percentage of unemployed university graduates is over 22 percent, a figure that has doubled in the last five years and is expected to keep increasing to 50 percent.  “The number of degree holders increased from 43,000 in the last five years to 120,000 this year,” El Khalfi stated. The Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP) reported that the higher a person’s level of general education–which typically ranges from elementary school to college–the lower the person’s likelihood of employment. Half of the active population (estimated at 52.2 percent) are not degree holders. For unemployment to decline, Morocco will need to create 115,000 additional jobs each year and maintain all current employment opportunities, to remain steady at the current workforce participation rate of 47 percent.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s speech struck a positive tone, despite Algeria’s reluctance to shoulder its responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. Delivered on Tuesday, the speech commemorated the 43rd  anniversary of the Green March, a revolutionary and a peaceful event that showed Moroccans’ willingness to defend their country’s territorial integrity. Algerian media, including major news outlet TSA, expressed satisfaction with the King’s speech. TSA said that King Mohammed VI’s speech “has a positive tone for the first time.” The news outlet added that King Mohammed VI “accustomed us to frontal attacks against Algeria,” in his previous Green March speeches. In recent years, Morocco’s government has used frank language to address Algeria and to call on it to take responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. Earlier this year, King Mohammed VI sent a message to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasizing the need for Algeria to contribute to the UN-led political process. King Mohammed VI’s speech may be perceived as a wise diplomatic move, especially after the adoption of Resolution 2440 at the Security Council on October 31. The resolution, for the first time, mentioned Algeria as a party that should contribute and “work constructively” with the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, to ensure the success of the political process. Besides the conflict, King Mohammed VI also focused on the lack of cooperation between the two countries separated by the world’s longest closed land border. The King opened doors for “any proposals and initiatives from Algeria” to re-establish bilateral ties he described as “not normal” and “much less acceptable.” “The mission of this mechanism would be to analyze all pending issues in good faith and in a very frank, objective and honest way, using an open-ended agenda, without conditions or exceptions,” the King added. The speech comes within a month of round-table talks to discuss the initial framework of possible negotiations over Western Sahara. The talks are at the request of Kohler, who invited the main parties and neighboring countries to the conflict to Geneva December 5-6. Algeria, also invited, has said that the conflict should be solved between the Polisario Front and Morocco, and it will attend the talks as an “observer.” It remains to be seen whether Algeria will agree to cooperate with Morocco and actively participate in the talks.

By Josh Babb Rabat – The report noted both Algeria and Morocco have included a significant number of SDGs, in their national environment and sustainable development strategies as well as their implementation frameworks. It highlighted, in particular, Morocco’s work to address food security and climate change. The briefing also highlighted numerous challenges in the Maghreb countries, citing youth employment, climate change, food security, and industrial transition as complex challenges that need to be addressed. When launched in 2015 the ECA outlined 17 goals to transform the world: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequality, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, life on land, peace and justice in institutions, and finally, partnerships to achieve the goal.  The SDG report recommended that going forward, the countries take steps to align their national priorities with the SDG framework and further integrate partnerships between governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. The UN’s ECA office in Tunisia released the report Friday, November 2, at the request of the Maghreb Arab Union to benchmark the Maghreb’s progress towards the goals set in 2015.  The report comes three years after the UN Commission laid out the original SDG framework and offers a preliminary assessment of how the Maghreb nations have put the plan into action. It specifically focuses on how the governments of the Maghreb have appropriated funds and integrated the SDG plans into their respective governing bodies.

Rabat – A pillar of the Moroccan overseas community, El Jamri died on Tuesday night in Rabat. His brother Faissal El Jamri confirmed it on Facebook. “My big brother Abdelhamid has died,” he wrote. Born in Guerrouane near Meknes in 1957, El Jamri held several positions on migration. El Jamri chaired the international network “Initiatives 21 for Development.” El Jamri also chaired several integration and assistance programs in European countries, according to  Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME). The author of several books on migration, El Jamri was also a member of the CCME and the president of the working group “Administration, User Rights and Public Policies.” El Jamri, who was also an expert in the European Union in economic development, served as the director of the Higher Institute of Training and Development in France. Saddened by the news, the head of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) Driss El Yazami wrote on his Twitter: “It is with sadness that I learned about the death of Abdelhamid Jamri tonight in Rabat. My sincere condolences to his family, his relatives and his friends. Rest in peace dear Hamid.” C’est avec tristesse que j’ai appris le décès de Abdelhamid Jamri @Aeljamri cette nuit à Rabat.

Rabat- Police carried out searches in Isere, southeast of Lyon; in Moselle, on the border with Germany and Luxembourg; and in Ille-et-Vilaine, near Rennes in northeast France. The French intelligence agency DGSI arrested the individuals, five men and a woman, who are reportedly linked to a far-right movement. DGSI has not yet issued details on the detainees except that they are being between the ages of 22 and 62. The suspects had reportedly been under DGSI surveillance. The arrests come two days after President Emmanuel Macron spoke in an interview with Le Courrier Picard on the escalating threat of the far-right movement. He said complacency in the early 1900s paved the way for Hitler’s rise in Germany and Mussolini’s in Italy.

Rabat – Many have questioned the sincerity of Morocco’s Africa agenda, arguing that Rabat is only trying to respond to the urge to reclaim Western Sahara by advancing Morocco’s own continental agenda. But to those still raising eyebrows and doubting Morocco’s African u-turn, King Mohammed VI has given an answer: Morocco feels genuinely proud of being historically African. The King, who was speaking to commemorate the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, a 1975 peaceful rally against Spain’s presence in Western Sahara, reaffirmed his attachment to Morocco’s African roots. Contrary to widely circulated ideas, the King elaborated, the Western Sahara question was not the primary reason for Morocco’s return to the African Union. “I decided that Morocco’s return to the African Union had also to be based on clarity and ambitious goals…. Morocco’s return to its institutional family was not intended as a means to defend the question of the Moroccan Sahara, given that the position of most African nations is similar to ours.” Dominant discourses have always cast doubt on Morocco’s—and North Africa’s—“Africanness.” The region is generally associated with the Arab world, thereby undermining its connection—geographical, historical, or cultural—to the rest of Africa. Morocco ready to share responsibility According to King Mohammed VI, Rabat’s return to the AU after decades of absence and ideological divergence is a token of Morocco’s readiness to contribute to the emerging narrative of African responsibility. Morocco wants to contribute as the continent feels overwhelming pressure to come to terms with its numerous socio-economic issues. In the King’s eyes, it felt natural to return and share responsibility on growing continental dynamics. “Our return to the African Union was dictated by the pride we take in belonging to Africa, as well as by our commitment to share in the development dynamic it is witnessing and to contribute to tackling the various challenges facing the Continent, without compromising our legitimate rights and best interests.” Even as reclaiming Western Sahara remains of paramount importance to Moroccans, “the aim is to make sure the Moroccan Sahara can once again play its historical role as an effective link between Morocco and its sub-Saharan African roots, be it from the geographical or historical perspective,” the King said.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI, who gave a speech Tuesday as Moroccans celebrated the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, called on Moroccans to espouse the same patriotism that, 43 years ago, paved the way for a “peaceful and gradual recovery of southern provinces.” Citing the key moments of the peaceful march, King Mohammed VI delivered a rallying cry for all Moroccans despite internal challenges: When it comes to the sacredness and the indivisibility of Morocco’s territorial integrity, Moroccans should be firm and unyielding. On November 6, 1975, over 300,000 unarmed Moroccans rallied to cross into Western Sahara. The peaceful popular uprising, which came to be known as the Green March, was a show of their commitment to Morocco’s sovereignty over the then Spanish-occupied territories. However, since the creation of the separatist Polisario Front’s self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in Western Sahara, Morocco’s legitimacy claims over the region has been subject to contention and acrimonious debates in the international community. United around Algeria and the Polisario Front, a number of countries have strenuously denied Morocco’s legitimacy rights over Western Sahara. They have called the kingdom an “occupier” and a “colonizer.” According to King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s challenge is to reclaim the “Moroccanness” of the disputed territory. To do so, the King argued, Moroccans—especially the diplomats and officials tasked with convincing the international community of Morocco’s position—should equip themselves with “clarity” with regards to history and “far-sightedness” regarding present and future challenges. Commitment to UN-led political process “Today, we are linking the past with the present, and we continue to safeguard the territorial integrity of our country with the same clarity, ambition, responsibility and committed action, both domestically and at the United Nations…. “This clarity is also shown by the firm, resolute manner in which we have been tackling all transgressions—whatever their origin—aimed at undermining Morocco’s legitimate rights or departing from the frame of reference agreed for the settlement process.” On October 31, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2440. The document called for a six-month extension of MINURSO’s mandate and the continuation of efforts to secure a politically negotiated, “lasting,” and “fair” settlement. It also noted that parties should come to negotiations with no agenda or preconditions. Perhaps aware that his rhetoric of uncompromising attachment to “the Moroccanness of Western Sahara” may come across in some circles as a veiled heads-up on Morocco’s demands, King Mohammed VI reiterated Morocco’s commitment to the UN-led political process. Analysts have suggested that Resolution 2440 marks a substantial diplomatic gain for Morocco. Not only did the resolution encourage Algeria to work with the UN on the political process, it also seems to have given a nod—however tacit—to Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan. King Mohammed VI, whose speech evinced satisfaction with prospects of diplomatic overtures under the UN’s watch, asserted that past diplomatic failures must inform the recently gained momentum to avoid another diplomatic deadlock in the Sahara dispute. For its part, Morocco will leave “no stone unturned” to ensure “complete” territorial integrity. Like their compatriots in 1975, Moroccans of all generations should be ready to “make whatever sacrifices are needed to defend the homeland,” the King said. He added that there is no better proof of loyalty to the nation than the perpetuation of the Green March spirit: “unity, security and stability.”

Rabat- “We have received, with pain, the sad news of the passing of the poet, Ali Squalli Houssaini, may his soul rest in peace,” the King wrote. The monarch conveyed his sentiments of sympathy to Squalli’s family and friends for theirs and the nation’s loss of one of the “pioneers of modern Arabic literature, the creator of the national anthem who enriched the national library.” The King recalled Squalli’s “righteousness, patriotism, and respect and devotion to the Alaouite crown,” and prayed for patience for Squalli’s family. Born in Fez in 1932, the author and poet wrote the national anthem in 1969 under the reign of King Hassan II. Before 1969, the anthem was used only in melody. The melody of the national anthem was in use without lyrics before Morocco’s independence in 1956. Throughout his career, Squalli received various awards for his literary works, including the Morocco Grand Prize in 1982 and the international prize of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia  for children’s literature in 1992.

Rabat – The Washington Post reported Interpol’s denial on Sunday. Last month, Morocco’s Ministry of Justice asserted that it extradited Prince Turki based on an international Interpol arrest warrant. The ministry called media allegations that Morocco helped to “disappear” Prince Turki “unfounded.” Morocco arrested Prince Turki at the Casablanca airport on November 11, 2015. The justice ministry said that it followed the proper extradition process and handled the case in Rabat’s Court of Cassation. The Saudi prince was a critic of his home country. According to the BBC, he was once in charge of policing the Saudi royal family, but moved to France in 2012 after he finished a prison sentence following a land dispute. In 2012, Prince Turki began posting videos critical of Saudi Arabia to YouTube calling for peaceful reforms. Prince Turki had requested asylum in France but later went to Morocco, which handed him over to Saudi Arabia. “Someone gave Turki bin Bandar the impression Morocco was safe so he went there to do some business and the Moroccan government took him and gave him to the Saudis,” said a Saudi opposition member “in touch with the prince shortly before he disappeared” according to the Guardian.  After Morocco extradited the prince, he disappeared. A friend of Prince Turki’s recalled that the prince gave him a book he had written soon before Morocco extradited him. The book came with a note: “Dear Wael, these statements are not to be shared unless I am kidnapped or assassinated. I know I will be kidnapped or they will assassinate me. I also know how they abuse my rights and those of the Saudi people.” Morocco’s justice ministry issued its statement on Prince Turki’s extradition in the aftermath of the October 2 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in their Istanbul consulate. Saudi Arabia admitted late in October that Khashoggi’s murder was premeditated.

Rabat – On the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed began his speech by devoting a long part of it to address Moroccan-Algerian relations.  The King recalled the common history of the two neighboring countries and confirmed his willingness to revive and foster the strained relations between Morocco and Algeria. For the King, the lack of unity between the Maghreb countries is “an unreasonable situation” which contradicts “the brotherly bonds uniting” peoples of Morocco and Algeria. Algeria’s border with Morocco has been closed since 1994 after Morocco announced a new visa requirement for Algerians following the Marrakech terrorist attack thought, at the time, to have been perpetrated by Algiers. “The Kingdom’s position in support of the Algerian revolution strengthened the bonds between the Moroccan Monarchy and the Algerian Resistance. It also paved the way for joint Maghrebian political awareness and action,” said the King. The two peoples, who share the same religion, language, history and destiny, fought for freedom and independence. The two countries had fought the French occupation.  France occupied Morocco in 1912 while it occupied Algeria in 1830. Algeria gained it independence in 1962, ending a 132-year colonization. Algeria was considered as part of France rather than one of its colonies. Together with Algeria, said the King, “we fought colonial rule for many years until independence was obtained. We know each other very well, and many Moroccan and Algerian families are united by the bonds of marriage and kinship.” Speaking about the bilateral relations between Algeria and Morocco, the monarch admitted that they are “not normal, much less acceptable.” For this reason, since he ascended the throne, King Mohammed VI strove to open the Morocco-Algeria borders and normalize the bilateral relations between the two countries based on “solid foundations of trust, solidarity and neighborliness.” The King expressed his country’s readiness for “a direct and frank dialogue with Algeria “to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries.” He suggested to set up a joint political and mutually agreed upon mechanism for dialogue and consultation. “The mission of this mechanism would be to analyze all pending issues in good faith and in a very frank, objective and honest way, using an open-ended agenda, without conditions or exceptions.” The mechanism would also enhance bilateral coordination and consultation regarding counterterrorism and migration issue. The monarch also emphasized that Morocco will consider any proposal or initiative by Algeria “to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations.” Morocco and Algeria relations have been strained for many years after several decades since the two countries gained independence. In October 1963, Morocco and Algeria fought the Sand War over the border near Figuig, eastern Morocco. The war increased tensions between the two countries for several years, but ultimately ended with no territorial changes. The war ended in February 1964 as a result of the mediation of third parties, mainly the US, the Arab League, and the Union of African Unity, who arranged a ceasefire. In 1972, Morocco and Algeria delineated their borders. However, in the years since, Morocco-Algeria tensions have only increased, causing the border between the countries to be closed in 1994. The only period of time when the Moroccan-Algerian borders were opened was between 1988 and 1994.

Here follows the full text of the royal speech: “Praise be to God May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin  Dear Citizens, I have been using an efficient approach when dealing with the nation’s major issues – an approach based on serious action and a keen spirit of responsibility at the domestic level, and on clarity and ambition, which are principles underpinning our foreign policy. Our action has always been based on these principles, even more so when we deal with our brothers, friends and neighbors, be it in terms of stances or reactions. Having said that, I should like to refer to the division and lack of unity in the Maghreb. This unreasonable situation is utterly inconsistent with the brotherly bonds uniting our peoples, who share the same religion, language, history and destiny. This reality is at odds with the ambition that induced the generation who fought for freedom and independence to seek to achieve the unity of the Maghreb, as symbolized, at the time, by the Tangier Conference, which was held in 1958 and whose sixtieth anniversary we are commemorating this year. Before that, the Kingdom’s position in support of the Algerian revolution strengthened the bonds between the Moroccan Monarchy and the Algerian Resistance. It also paved the way for joint Maghrebianpolitical awareness and action. Together, we fought colonial rule for many years until independence was obtained. We know each other very well, and many Moroccan and Algerian families are united by the bonds of marriage and kinship. We also realize that our peoples’ interests are best served by our unity, integration and complementarity. There is actually no need for third-party mediation. Nevertheless, we must be realistic and admit that the state of our bilateral relations is not normal, much less acceptable. Let me point out – and God is my witness – that soon after I acceded to the throne, I asked earnestly and in good faith that the borders between our two countries be opened and that Moroccan-Algerian relations be normalized. I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries. To this end, I suggest to our Algerian brothers that we set up a joint political mechanism for dialogue and consultation. This mechanism’s format, nature and level of representation can be mutually agreed upon. I should like to stress that Morocco is willing to consider the proposals or initiatives Algeria may want to offer in this regard so as to break the stalemate in the relations between the two neighbors and sister nations. The mission of this mechanism would be to analyze all the issues on hand in good faith and in a very frank, objective and honest way, using an open-ended agenda, without conditions or exceptions. This mechanism can also serve as a practical platform for cooperation regarding all bilateral matters, particularly with respect to making the most of the numerous development opportunities existing in the Maghreb region. It will also contribute to enhancing bilateral coordination and consultation and help us rise to regional and international challenges, particularly in terms of fighting terrorism and addressing the issue of migration. I should like to reiterate, in this regard, my commitment to work hand in hand with my brothers in Algeria, making sure their national institutions are fully respected. Given our warm feelings towards the Algerian people and leadership, and the esteem in which we hold them, we shall spare no effort in Morocco to build our bilateral relations on the solid foundations of trust, solidarity and neighborliness, in keeping with the words of my ancestor – may peace and blessings be upon Him – who said that Gabriel recommended so persistently that He treat neighbors well that He thought he would give them a share of the inheritance.  Dear Citizens, The Green March, whose 43rd anniversary we are commemorating today, was a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle to complete the nation’s territorial integrity. This process has been characterized by the symbiosis between the throne and the people and alsoby the peaceful and gradual recovery of our Southern Provinces. Last April, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the recovery of Tarfaya. In a few months, we shall commemorate the 50th anniversary of the recovery of Sidi Ifni, then the 40th anniversary of the recovery of OuedEddahab. Those were historic events, during which the Moroccan people in general, and the Saharan tribes in particular, showed unparalleled unanimity in their commitment to the Moroccanness of the Sahara. Today, we are linking the past with the present, and we continue to safeguard the territorial integrity of our country with the same clarity, ambition, responsibility and committed action, both domestically and at the United Nations. This clarity can be seen in the unchanging principles and frame of reference underpinning Morocco’s position, which I set out in the speech I delivered on the 42nd anniversary of the Green March, and which have informed our action until this day. This clarity is also shown by the firm, resolute manner in which we have been tackling all transgressions – whatever their origin – aimed at undermining Morocco’s legitimate rights or departing from the frame of reference agreed for the settlement process. As for ambition, it is reflected by Morocco’s cooperation in good faith with the UN Secretary-General and by the support our country lends to his Personal Envoy to establish a serious and credible political process. Our ambition is also displayed in our country’s constructive initiatives and in its positive reaction to various international calls for practical proposals that can help achieve a realistic and lasting political settlement based on compromise and on our Autonomy Initiative. With regard to the current momentum and the UN’s tireless efforts, Morocco firmly believes that the experience and the lessons of the past ought to be taken into account in order to avoid the shortcomings and pitfalls of the Manhasset process. At the domestic level, I am pressing ahead with efforts to put an end to the policy of rent-seeking and privilege. I also refuse all forms of blackmail or exploitation in connection with the question of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity. In the same vein, no stone is being leftunturned in the pursuit of progress in our Southern Provinces under the new development model. The aim is to make sure the Moroccan Sahara can once again play its historical role as an effective link between Morocco and its sub-Saharan African roots, be it from the geographical or historical perspective. In parallel, the actual implementation of advanced regionalization is contributing to the emergence of a genuine political elite that can effectively and democratically represent the inhabitants of the Sahara and enable them to exercise their right to run their local affairs themselves, and to achieve integrated development in a free and stable environment.  Dear Citizens, Following the same approach, I decided that Morocco’s return to the African Union had also to be based on clarity and ambitious goals. Morocco’s return to its institutional family was not intended as a means to defend the question of the Moroccan Sahara, given that the position of most African nations is similar to ours. Our return to the African Union was dictated by the pride we take in belonging to Africa, as well as by our commitment to share in the development dynamic it is witnessing and to contribute to tackling the various challenges facing the Continent, without compromising our legitimate rights and best interests. I wish to commend, in this regard, the recent decisions made by the AU Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in Nouakchott, which were consistent with the relevant international positions and principles. This constructive attitude means wisdom and far-sightedness have prevailed. It also constitutes a break with ploys that used to proliferate within the African Union. Because of these practices, Africa and African peoples lost precious time that should have been devoted to promoting development and integration. In the same spirit, Morocco will invest in effective, wealth-generating economic partnerships with all countries and economic blocs, including the European Union. However, we shall not be involved in any partnership that undermines our country’s territorial integrity. I am keen to make sure these partnerships benefit directly the inhabitants of the Moroccan Sahara first and foremost, and that they contribute to improving their livelihoods within their homeland, in an environment characterized by freedom and a dignified life.   Dear Citizens, Commemorating the Green March is more than a celebration of a historical event which has special symbolic value and is deeply rooted in immutable national principles. The Green March epitomizes the Moroccan people’s firm belief in their legitimate right to see to it that the process of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity is completed. It also reflects their unwavering commitment to make whatever sacrifices are needed to defend the homeland. This has been a characteristic, longstanding policy rooted in national unanimity and across-the-board mobilization. The aim is to promote integrated development and preserve unity, security and stability. There is no better token of loyalty to the architect of the Green March, my revered father, His late Majesty King Hassan II – may he rest in peace – and to the glorious martyrs of our motherland. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

“We found a form of political exploitation of [what we think was] only a mere presentation of a document,” the center was quoted by HuffPost Maroc as saying. The exhibition room has been closed to the public since Sunday morning, according to Maghreb Arab Press. The center explained that the book “was not an exhibition” but a simple presentation of a book made by artists. The book was represented in a “room of the museum’s permanent collections.” According to the center, the book named “Necessità dei volti” consists of 483 images chosen from a collection of photographs collected by the Polisario Front during the war with Morocco.  The suspension of the Pro-polisario book came after the president of the Moroccan National Museum Foundation, Mehdi Qotbi, denounced the move on November 2. On October 31, Algerian news agency Algeria Press Service (APS) reported that “the Center Georges-Pompidou devotes a gallery to the struggle of the Saharawi people.” Qotbi told TelQuel that he “did not see the exhibition, but I acted as a Moroccan citizen who loves his country and is convinced that the Sahara is Moroccan,” after he had read APS article. “As soon as I learned the information, I immediately called the president of the Geroges-Pompidou Center Serge Lasvignes. He told me that he did not know and was going to take a closer look and get back to me as soon as possible,” Qotbi said. On November 2, Qotbi send a letter to Lasvignes. “Artistic and political stakeholders in Morocco are appalled by a center they held on high esteem. People don’t understand the real motivation of your institution to participate in the propaganda of a separatist movement notoriously financed by Algeria, Qotbi said in the letter.

Rabat – A number of countries have expressed outright support for the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the basis for a consensual solution to the Western Sahara dispute. These countries, which include the US and several European and Arab powers, deem Morocco’s National Autonomy Plan the most promising political solution to resolve the Sahara conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the most recent initiative, suggested by Morocco in April 2007. In a letter to Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, King Mohammed VI confirmed Morocco’s commitment to a consensual solution to terminate the dispute over the Sahara. In the same letter, the King informed the UN Secretary General that Morocco was preparing to submit an autonomy project within the framework of the territorial integrity and the national unity of the country. The plan was suggested in 2007, after James Baker, the UN Personal Envoy to Western Sahara from 1997 to 2004, had failed to reach consensual means to reconcile the positions of Morocco and the Polisario Front separatist group. Baker’s first and second plans escalated the dispute between Morocco and Polisario. Baker’s first plan, proposed in 2001, supported the territory’s autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Called Baker I, it was strongly endorsed by Morocco, while the Polisario and its supporters, mainly Algeria, rejected the plan. In 2003, Baker offered a substitute plan, Baker Plan II, proposing that the Western Sahara should be autonomous under the sovereignty of Morocco for a five-year period, followed by a referendum of all residents of the territory. Morocco rejected Baker’s second plan in 2004, stating that it would never accept a referendum in its territory. In 2006, King Mohammed VI re-established the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS) after the Autonomy Plan was devised as a preferred alternative to the Baker plans. CORCAS then visited a number of countries to explain Morocco’s objectives. A number of international countries welcomed Morocco’s plan, characterizing it as the best possible resolution of the four-decade-long conflict. The project, entitled “The Moroccan Initiative for Negotiating an Autonomy for Statute for the Sahara Region,” is the fruit of a dialogue with the local populations and political parties which was handed over to the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on April 11, 2007. Here are the main facts about Morocco’s Autonomy Plan: A Head of Government for Sahara This initiative, which is a basis for negotiation, gives sizable autonomy to the inhabitants of Western Sahara under the sovereignty of Morocco: it reconciles the kingdom’s territorial integrity with the people’s need to manage their own affairs. The solution consists of an “extended autonomy” that satisfies the aspirations of the Saharawi populations, because it insists on respecting the cultural identity of these populations while respecting the territorial unity of Morocco. According to this project, the Moroccan state will retain the attributes of sovereignty, “including the national flag, the national anthem and the currency,” in addition to the national security, the external defense, external relations the religious prerogatives of the King, and the Kingdom’s judicial system. The autonomous region will have a Head of Government as well as a Parliament that will vote on laws at the local level in accordance with the constitution of the country. Moreover, the autonomous region will be given the prerogative to run its affairs democratically, through legislative, executive, and judicial bodies enjoying exclusive powers. “They will have the financial resources needed for the region’s development in all fields, and will take an active part in the nation’s economic, social and cultural life.” It Will Be Approved by a Referendum Under the proposal, the region’s autonomy statute will be the subject of negotiations which will be submitted to the populations concerned for a referendum in accordance with “the principle of self-determination and the provisions of the United Nations Charter.” Subsequently, a national referendum will be organized, which will strengthen the constitutional nature of the first referendum. Well after the organization of this double referendum, a transitional council composed of Moroccan officials and Polisario front members will assist with the “repatriation, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of armed elements who are outside the territory.” In this way, the Autonomy will be installed. Algeria Will Be Strongly Involved   The United Nations Security Council called on Morocco and the Polisario Front to engage in “negotiations without preconditions, in order to reach a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution that would ensure the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.” Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that “the neighboring countries, Algeria and Mauritania, should be invited to these negotiations and be consulted separately on issues that directly affect them […].” Peter Van Walsum, the former UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara from  2005 to 2008, said on April 23, 2007, “It would be completely dishonest for me not to say that [the Algerians] have not played an important and preeminent role in the conflict since 1975.” In an unprecedented speech delivered on the occasion of the 39th anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI said that Algeria is responsible for hindering the process of finding a mutual and ever-lasting solution to the Sahara conflict. “Unless Algeria – the main party in this conflict – is held accountable, there will be no solution. Moreover, without a responsible approach to the tense security situation in the region, there will be no stability,” said the King.  In March 2018, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Algeria to actively participate and engage in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon solution to the conflict. In his March report, Guterres said: “I would like to reiterate the Security Council’s call on neighboring States, Algeria and Mauritania, to make important contributions to the political process and to increase their engagement in the negotiating process,” he said. Following the report, King Mohammed VI wrote a new statement to Guterres, calling on Algeria to fully shoulder its responsibility in searching for a solution to the regional conflict. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King. On October 3, 2018,  Guterres called on all parties to show commitment to the UN-led political process. He also called on the parties to accept his personal envoy’s invitations for roundtable talks in Geneva without preconditions and in good faith. The UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, invited all parties to take part in the roundtable talks in Geneva on December 5-6. Algeria accepted the invitation, but it is still denying its role in the conflict. Morocco’s eastern neighbor says that the conflict should be solved only between Morocco and Polisario. However, the latest UN resolution (2440) called on Algeria to “work constructively” with Kohler to ensure the success of the political process. Autonomy Plan Is (Also) Self-Determination The right to self-determination is one of the most important, yet contentious, principles of international law. Its implementation has always been more controversial than its content. Self-determination gained further acceptance as reflected by its incorporation into the United Nations Charter. Specifically, the first article of the charter provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determinations of peoples.” However, the principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it would be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy, or full assimilation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. By extension, the term self-determination has come to mean the right of a people to determine its own destiny. In particular, the principle allows a people to choose its own political status and to determine its own form of economic, cultural, and social development. The exercise of this right can result in a variety of different outcomes ranging from political independence through to full integration within a state. It includes any other form of political organization freely given by the community in question, such as autonomy, federalism, or integration. Thus, qualifying a priori community of “people” prejudices its future status. The notion of “people” itself does not have unanimity, either in terms of international law, or within the scientific community. In this perspective, self-determination can be defined as the right of a given human group to choose freely its political status, not just independence. As stated in an interview with El Pais published on February 22, 2007, Chakib Benmoussa, the former Interior Minister of Morocco and current ambassador in France, made it clear saying that “self-determination has never been synonymous with independent statehood.” “Autonomy is a form of self-determination in the event of political agreement between the parties, with the endorsement of the UN Security Council, and prior consultation of the concerned population, as has been in this case,” said Benmoussa. The result is an instrumentalization of the concept of self-determination by the Polisario and some foreign powers, which reduce it to that of independence.

Rabat- The new Law 103-13 to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination, which went into effect on September 12, promises prison sentences ranging from one to six months for people who sexually harass in public spaces. Harassment is defined, by use of words, acts or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes. Sexual harassment continues to plague Morocco. The masaktach (I won’t be silent) movement, which started in September, aims to shed light on and counter the discrimination and violence targeting women in Morocco. Masaktach’s new hashtag invites Moroccan women in Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech, to carry whistles with them on Saturday, November 10, and use them whenever they are harassed, whether in the street or on public transport. Photos of a sack of colored whistles have been shared on social media, encouraging women to do the same. Que la distribution commence 🙂 #masaktach @masaktach pic.twitter.com/xpFrhDE5tI — Aida Alami (@AidaAlami) 5 novembre 2018  Hello @mdinabuscasa! Avez-vous vu la campagne lancée par #Masaktach? Les femmes sont invitées à porter des sifflets contre le harcèlement dans l’espace public et dans les bus! Et si vous rejoigniez le mouvement en offrant des sifflets à vos passagères le 10 nov? #ila_dsser_seffri — Lylou Slass (@Lylou20) 5 novembre 2018  The initiative may have been inspired by Mexico city’s 2016 plan to fight sexual harassment with plastic whistles. Just like in Mexico, #ila_dsser_seffri is receiving mockery and criticism from some social media users.  The #Masaktach movement is the Moroccan equivalent of the global #MeToo movement. Both the law against sexual harassment and Masaktach came after widely-publicized cases of rape, harassment, and violence which outraged Moroccan citizens. The latest rape case to receive wide attention was of Khadija, a 17-year-old Moroccan who said she was kidnapped and raped by more than 12 men for two months.  Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, she said, writing their names on her skin. Another case caused outrage in Casablanca last year when a group of teanagers physically harassed a young woman on a moving bus while other passengers did nothing.

Rabat – Salma, a former Polisario commanding officer, expressed satisfaction with the latest Security Council resolution and the ongoing UN-led political process in Western Sahara. In an interview with Morocco World News, Salma said that the resolution favors Morocco’s position. Security Council changes equation of Western Sahara conflict Salma told MWN that the resolution has “condoned everything Morocco is doing in the Saharan regions west of the birm, which has been called occupied territory.” Meanwhile, the resolution restricts Polisario from doing the same activities in Sahrawi areas east of the berm, “an area that Polisario claims as liberated zones.” Salma argued that Morocco’s position gained a nod internationally, while the separatists’ position has “undergone a tremendous setback in the last three years.” Salma’s statement refers to the latest point Morocco scored with the European Union. In July, Rabat and Brussels agreed to renew the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement, which the Polisario has long sought to abolish. The EU also ruled that the waters off the Western Sahara could be included in the fisheries agreement. While explaining how the resolution plays in favor of Morocco, Salma said, “Polisario is not only banned from meeting any foreign representatives outside of the Tindouf camps in Algeria, but they are also urged not to relocate to or construct any facilities in the areas that have been long claimed as ‘liberated zones.’” He added that Resolution 2440 urges the Polisario to withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer strip, “where they have been staying for two years, claiming that they will not leave until negotiations, as established after the ceasefire agreement, and the inevitable result of shared administration with Morocco or of being controlled by the UN and both parties benefiting from its revenues.” No escape for Algeria According to Salma, the resolution has destroyed Polisario’s plans because the Security Council said that the Guerguerat buffer strip is a red line, “and Polisario should not get closer to it.” He added that the resolution cost Polisario all its cards as they are now left in Tindouf “with a view to the cessation of [Polisario’s] legal political status and to deal with Sahrawi population as refugees and to find solutions to their problems.” Besides Polisario, the Security Council also sent a clear message to Algeria, which has long claimed itself only an observer to the conflict. The resolution referred to Algeria as a neighboring country to the conflict and not an observer. Political analyst El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui told Morocco World News there is a huge difference between an observer and a neighboring country. The resolution called on Algeria to bear responsibility and to work “constructively” with the UN Personal Envoy along with Morocco, Polisario, and Mauritania “to ensure the success” of the UN-led political process. Salma said that the Security Council is on “the verge of changing the concept of the ‘parties to the conflict’ as the Council started to convey clear messages to Algeria, referring to it as a ‘neighboring country’ and not an observer.” He speculated that Algeria will be considered a “main party to the conflict” soon. “And when it will go that far, there will be two equal parties [Algeria and Morocco] who have the right and legitimacy to act.”. According to the former Polisario member, when Algeria will acknowledge its role in the conflict, “a solution to the conflict which will satisfy all parties to the conflict will be possible. Otherwise, the conflict will go right back to square one.”

Rabat – The collapse reportedly occurred at 7:20 a.m., in the Derb L’Maizi neighborhood, due to the dilapidated condition of the house. The heavy rain fall had also weakened the house. Civil Protection forces are believed to still be trying to move the rubble in hopes of rescuing the two remaining residents alive. The owners of the house reportedly received notice a week ago to leave their home given its ruined condition.

Rabat – Since Spain occupied Western Sahara in 1884, Morocco had severely resisted it to end the occupation and retake the southern provinces. In the 1970s, King Hassan II decided to adopt a new peaceful strategy that would put pressure on Spain, especially since General Franco, Spain’s leader at the time, was sick. On October 16, 1975, King Hassan II called upon his people to stage a peaceful march towards the southern provinces in Western Sahara and to gather in the Moroccan town of Tarfaya, 100 kilometers north of Laayoune. Hassan II’s speech launching the Green March came on the date when the International Court of Justice ruled that the Western Sahara was a no-man’s land prior to Spanish occupation. The court also acknowledged the existence of legal ties of allegiance between the sultan of Morocco and the resident Sahrawi tribes. “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said. The purpose was to free the southern provinces from the remaining Spanish occupation. On November 6, 1975, more than 350,000 unarmed Moroccan men and women rallied in Tarfaya to cross the border into Western Sahara. Marchers carried Moroccan flags, green banners, Qur’ans, and pictures of King Hassan II throughout the march. Hundreds of trucks and buses transported people from different cities in Morocco to Western Sahara. In a statement on the occasion of the Green March, Morocco’s High Commission for Former Resistance Fighters and Members of the Army of Liberation (HCAR) said the Green March showed the world King Hassan II’s brilliance and the determination of Moroccan people from the north to the south to achieve complete independence and territorial integrity. Moroccans had sacrificed their lives to end colonialism for almost fifty years, HCAR added. For King Mohammed VI, the Green March showed Moroccans’ true patriotism and a sacrificial spirit that should be remembered by the generations to come. “As we commemorate the anniversary of the Green March and reminisce on the M’hamid al-Ghizlan Speech, we should draw inspiration from the ideals of true patriotism, from the spirit of loyalty to the nation’s sacred values and from sacrifice for the homeland,” King Mohammed VI said in his Green March speech last year. “We need to remember those values today and to embody them everywhere—at school, in families and in society—in order to rise to the internal and external challenges our country is faced with,” the King added. Colonization divided the country between the French protectorate in central Morocco and the Spanish protectorate in northern and southern Morocco, while Tangier was an international zone. This made the task of liberating the national territory difficult. After Morocco gained its independence in 1956, the liberation army was mobilized in the south of Morocco to complete the independence of the entire national territory. Morocco then retook the province of Tarfaya and Tan-Tan in 1958 after Morocco and Spain signed the Treaty of Angra de Cintra in the same year. Spain was forced to sign the treaty because it faced strong resistance from the Moroccan Army of Liberation. In 1965, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2072, urging Spain to negotiate with Morocco to liberate Sidi Ifni. On June 30, 1969, Spain and Morocco signed the Treaty of Fez amid international pressure, allowing Morocco to regain Sidi Ifni. The historic Green March crowned the Moroccan resistance on November 6, 1975. The march succeeded in recovering the southern provinces peacefully and civilly. On February 28, 1976, the Moroccan national flag was hoisted in Laayoune. On August 14, 1979, Morocco regained the province of Oued Eddahab. The Green March Day is a significant event in Morocco’s history. It is an occasion to remember the struggle of Moroccan people and King Hassan II against French and Spanish occupation and to pay tribute to Moroccans who devoted their lives to liberate the kingdom from colonization. One year after the Green March, the Polisario Front declared war against Morocco, after Spain’s withdrawal. The war continued until a ceasefire in 1991. Since then, the conflict over Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria, has not yet ended. The UN Security Council has adopted many resolutions but without realistic effect on the ground to end the long-lasting conflict. However, the most recent Resolution 2440 that the Security Council adopted on October 31 included some slight change regarding Algeria. Algeria, which the resolution mentioned three times on semi-equal footing with Morocco and Polisario, will participate in the Geneva round-table on December 5 and 6.  As for Morocco, the only way to resolve the Western Sahara conflict is the adoption of the autonomy plan under Moroccan sovereignty.

Rabat –  Forty-three years ago, King Hassan II of Morocco called on hundreds of thousands of Moroccan citizens to head to Western Sahara to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. The famous peaceful “green march” gained the respect of many. Several local and international news outlets commemorated the Green March through reports and documentaries about the historical event. In January 2017, RTS published a 20-minute press report from its archives on the Green March after King Hassan II gave his famous speech to the nation. “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said on October 16, 1975. With respect and appreciation, more than 350,000 Moroccans took the speech to heart without hesitation. “Morocco and the Green March. Green, because the color of the star in Morocco’s flag is green. It was preferred because green was Mohammed the prophet’s favorite color,” RTS’s reporter explains. For Morocco, the Green March is sacred, according to RTS. The reporter then talked about the political aspect of the event aimed to liberate Western Sahara from the Spanish colonizers. Escorted by more than 20,000 Moroccan troops, Moroccans headed to Western Sahara to show their willingness to sacrifice for their homeland. According to the press report, double the number the King  called on took part in the event. From north to south, people of all ages marched with flags and Qur’ans in the unprecedented event. The march featured hundreds of thousands of citizens coming from all regions across the country. Each celebrated the march in a unique way. The march marked the presence of folk music performances that praised and respected to Hassan II with their traditional songs. Others marched and chanted patriotic slogans supporting Morocco’s territorial integrity. The documentary’s narrator says both the army and the administration mobilized to contribute to the success of the Green March. During the documentary, RTS interviewed citizens showing eminent love and passion for the King. “Long live the King,” people said while being loaded into trucks for transport. “Those who were coming from the north had to travel 2,000 kilometers” to reach the Sahara, the reporter noted. About 50 people were carried in each truck. “After the royal speech of his majesty, we will travel to the capital, Laayoune … Sahara is Moroccan. Sahara is Moroccan,” one citizen told RTS while others shouted “Sahara is Moroccan!” with pride and joy. “Jihad, Jihad and Spain should leave the country,” was another slogan repeated during the Green March. RTS crew accompanied Moroccans throughout their journey to the Sahara. The reporter said that throughout the journey, the crew received the same response: “We are going to the Sahara.” When the journalist asked people whether Sahrawis are Moroccans, one of shouted, “Yes, they are Moroccans.” King Hassan II had done his utmost to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. Confidential documents released by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2017 revealed that King Hassan II was “plotting an armed attack” against Spain in the 1970s over Western Sahara. In the document, “Memorandum of Conversation,” former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger informed Spain that King Hassan II was planning to launch a war against Spain in October 1975, a month before Morocco’s peaceful Green March. In a conversation with former Spanish foreign minister Pedro Cortina, Kissinger said that the US had “some information concerning a possible Moroccan attack in the Sahara.” He added, “I want you to know that we have urged the King of Morocco not to do it, that is, not to do anything rash. We have warned him against it and have urged him to negotiate, just as I urge you to negotiate.” Spain replied that it was ready to negotiate with Morocco. The Spain-Morocco conflict dated back to 1859 when Spain defeated Morocco in the Battle of Tetouan. Morocco then had to pay Spain to cede part of its southern and northern territories. In 1956, immediately after Morocco obtained its independence, it reasserted its claim to the Western Sahara and called on Spain to return it to Morocco’s sovereignty. King Hassan II then launched the Green March in November 1975 allowing Morocco de facto sovereignty over the territory. Since then, Western Sahara has been claimed by the Polisario Front, a separatist movement supported by Algeria.

Rabat- The tax increase will affect the most widely-consumed cigarettes on the market, Marlboro and Marquise. Marlboro packs will be sold for MAD 40 instead of 33, and Marquise for MAD 21 instead of 19. Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun explained the tax hike in a press conference Monday at the ministry’s headquarters in Rabat. According to Article 5 of the 2019 Finance Bill, the minimum tax rate will increase from MAD 567 to MAD 630 per 1,000 cigarettes, while the minimum tax burden will increase from 53.6 percent to 58 percent. Morocco received MAD 10.48 billion from the domestic consumption tax in 2017, up from MAD 9.86 billion in 2016, according to customs administration. Last month, Benchaaboun stated that the bill’s increasing taxes on tobacco consumption will generate additional revenue estimated at MAD 1.2 billion in 2019.

Rabat- In its 2018 annual Freedom on the Net report released on November 1, US-based NGO Freedom House assessed that Morocco is “partially free” in terms of freedom for internet users.  Not much has changed since the 2017 report as Morocco maintained its score, 45 out of 100. Freedom on the Net assesses 65 countries, covering 87 percent of the world’s internet users worldwide, and tracks developments in internet freedom each year. The report monitored the internet freedom in Morocco from June 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018, noting the Moroccan government’s crackdown on online news channels and imprisoning of journalists and activists for their involvement in the Hirak protests in Al Hoceima. “Moroccan laws on criminal defamation and terrorism continue to pose a threat to free speech. Several online journalists and activists were arrested and imprisoned as part of a crackdown on the Hirak Rif protests,” the report states. The research mentions Moroccan journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, editor in chief of news site Badil Info. A Moroccan court sentenced El Mahdaoui to 3 years in prison in June for “inciting participation in banned [Hirak] protests” and “threatening national security.” Like Mahdaoui, Abdelkabir Al-Hor, the founder of the online news site Rassd Maroc, was sentenced to 4 years in prison in February on charges of “condoning terrorism and inciting illegal street protests through the outlet’s coverage of the protests.” In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison for their participation in the “unauthorized” protests. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017. The report also addressed the difficulty of creating a news website in Morocco. It recalls the Ministry of Culture and Communications’ refusal to grant press cards to Mohamed Ezzouak, founder of Moroccan news outlet Yabiladi, and Ali Amar, founder of French-language site Le Desk. The cards were granted seven months later in May 2018. It is illegal for news outlets without press cards to practice journalism in Morocco, according to the 2016 press code. Though the state has strong control over media content, it did not block or filter any political, social, or religious websites and other sites discussing controversial issues such as the disputed territory of Western Sahara, the Amazigh (Berber) minority, or Islamist groups, nor social media sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitter “over the coverage period.” Still, the state can shut down publications “prejudicial to Islam, the monarchy, territorial integrity, or public order” and issue prison sentences and heavy fines on publishers of infringing content. News criticizing the monarchy does not exist in Morocco, notes the report. The report notes: “Discriminatory allocation of advertising and the repeated prosecution of online news editors impedes the diversification of Morocco’s digital media landscape. Digital advertisers were obliged to pay a 5 percent tax starting in January 2018, stifling an already financially fragile media sector.” The partial freedom given to Moroccan internet users has allowed them to “take advantage of various social media tools to educate, organize, and mobilize people around a wide variety of issues.” That organization was shown in the April boycott campaign that targeted three major companies in the country. The research recalls the major boycott against high prices which sprouted on April 20 thanks to “online activism.” It all started with Arabic hashtags equivalent to “Let_it_spoil” and “SayNotoHighPrices,” against not only the high prices of Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Danone (dairy products), and Afriquia (gasoline) but also against market monopolization and all forms of price manipulation across the country.  The boycott caused a massive controversy in the country and prompted government ministers to repeatedly ask Moroccans to end the milk boycott, particularly.  The boycott caused major economic losses for the targeted companies in its early days. Afriquia stations recorded losses of 47 percent in Nador, 25 percent in Al Hoceima, and 39 percent in Casablanca’s Hay Hassani less than a month later, according to newspaper Akhbar Alyaoum. Centrale Danone suffered a net loss of MAD 115 million in the first half of 2018 in comparison to a net gain of MAD 56 million during the same period in 2017. The boycott had largely ended by mid summer. Digital activists also continue to provide a platform for discussion on the Hirak protests. Beyond Morocco, the report states that of the 65 countries assessed, 26 have been on an overall decline in terms of internet freedom since June 2017, compared with 19 that registered net improvements. Egypt and Sri Lanka, followed by Cambodia, Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Venezuela, scored the biggest declines. “A number of governments are moving to regulate social media users as media outlets in order to legitimize further crackdowns on online speech,” Freedom on the Net reported. Egypt ranks third in the world for highest numbers of jailed journalists.

Rabat – The resolution called for Algeria, along with Mauritania, Morocco, and Polisario to “work constructively” with the personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler. The aim is to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The Algerian government was not pleased to find itself mentioned in the resolution as a country that should contribute to the UN-led political process. Algeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs defied the Security Council’s proposal in a statement on November 1. In the statement, Abdelkader Messahel’s department claimed that the Security Council “again calls upon the two parties to the conflict, which it has clearly identified, namely Morocco and the Polisario Front, to resume direct negotiations without preconditions and in good faith.” The statement, however, ignored that the resolution did not exempt Algeria and Mauritania from taking part in the talks to help Kohler and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to “ensure a successful outcome,” through the duration of the UN-led process. It is not the first time that Algeria has denied its role in the conflict. In recent years, Morocco has been calling on Algiers  to bear full responsibility and act within the framework of the UN to contribute to the process. The resolution also came in conjunction with Morocco’s preparation to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the Green March on Tuesday, November 6. The event commemorates Moroccans’ retaking Western Sahara after the Spanish left in 1975. Analysts say this resolution carries significant weight for Morocco’s diplomacy.  Moussaoui El Ajlaoui, a Moroccan expert on the  Western Sahara issue, told Morocco World News that the resolution complements Guterres’ report, which he submitted to the Security Council on October 3. A cursory reading of the report, according to El Ajlaoui, affirms that both the resolution and the report are positive for Morocco’s position. “It is the first time that the Security Council called on Algeria to bear responsibility as it is mentioned along with the Frente Polisario, Mauritania, and Morocco in the resolution,”El  Ajlaoui said. UN moves towards acknowledging Algeria’s responsibility  According to the analyst, it is the first time that the UN acknowledged that the Western Sahara is a “regional conflict.” The resolution, while not saying so in those words, noted that the December talks will “address regional issues.”  Resolution 2440 mentioned Kohler’s invitations for roundtable talks, saying that it “welcomes that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively, and encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” Like El Ajlaoui, political analyst Dr. Abdelfattah El Fatihi emphasized the  importance of Algeria’s presence at the round-table as a “main” party and not an “observer” as the resolution breaks Algeria’s precondition of being an observer. El Fatihi told MWN that Algeria’s inclusion in the resolution frustrates Polisario’s plan to sit at the round-table as a legitimate representative of the Sahrawis. El Fatihi added that placing responsibility on Algeria to contribute to the UN-led political process would ease pressure about future negotiations because Morocco has always refused to take part in future negotiations with Polisario only. “Resolution 2440 adopted a realistic approach that should frame any discussions to find a political solution to the Sahara conflict, moving away from the traditional and radical viewpoint that the Frente POLISARIO repeats” to defend its separatist ideology. He noted that the resolution reiterates the position of former Dutch diplomat, Peter Van Walsum, who served as the UN Personal Envoy for Western Sahara 2005-2008. Walsum told the Security Council in 2008 that “independence” for the Western Sahara was “unrealistic.” Since 2007, Morocco has relentlessly tried to convince the international community that its autonomy plan is serious and credible. Rabat has maintained that the solution for Western Sahara should be local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. It has also ruled out independence and a referendum, which has long been sought by the separatist group. For El Fatihi, the resolution is aware of Morocco’s demand, which is to invite Algeria to negotiations to find a sustainable solution. The resolution also acknowledges that the conflict is regional, El Fatihi said, agreeing with El Ajlaoui. University professor Reda El Fellah asserted in his statement to MWN that the resolution is “significantly oriented towards preparing the most effective and suitable conditions to make the upcoming political negotiations successful.” El Fellah said that there are two pillars that make the resolution “notably genuine.” He said that, first, the solution comes to speed up the political process “that should lead to a political, just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.” The second pillar, according to El Fellah, is that the  resolution “puts pressure on neighboring countries and the message is obviously specifically destined to Algeria as the most involved neighboring state in the conflict. The resolution calls on Algeria to contribute actively to the political process. It requires from this neighboring state to participate in the next roundtable without preconditions and in good faith.”  No more ‘liberated zones’ claims To justify its illegal presence east of Morocco’s defense wall, the Polisario Front claims some areas as “liberated zones,” including Bir Lahlou and Tifariti. Resolution 2440 pressures Polisario to stop any activity that might destabilize the status quo of the region. The resolution “further calls on the Frente POLISARIO to fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat,” reads the second part of operative paragraph 7. El Ajlaoui said that it is clear that the resolution calls on Polisario not to “construct any facility in the region” in his words. The zones are part of Western Sahara, east of the Moroccan berm, and west and northwest of the borders with Algeria and Mauritania. The analyst said that three members of the Security Council—Russia, Ethiopia, Bolivia—did not vote on Wednesday, not because “they have a political stance against Morocco, but because the US did not consult enough with them.” El Ajlaoui added that there is a huge difference between a neighboring country and an observer country. He said that the language used in the resolution calls on Algeria to bear responsibility in the conflict as a neighboring country  and contribute to the political process and not only act as an observer. On December 5-6, all parties, without precondition, will sit at the round table for talks. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has already made it clear on what the Moroccan representatives will discuss during the roundtable.  He said that Morocco will participate in the roundtable to remind the parties and the UN of its firm position. Morocco, Bourita has stressed, will not accept any solution that is against its sovereignty. In the resolution, the Security Council explained that the roundtable will help Kohler to “take stock of recent developments, address regional issues, and discuss the next steps in the political process on Western Sahara.”

Rabat – According to the Moroccan National Highway Company report for 2017, traffic of both light and heavy cars increased by 5 percent, respectively representing 78 percent and 22 percent of total traffic.  Highway traffic tolls grossed MAD 2.8 billion in 2017.  More drivers are using “Jawaz” cards to make automatic payment at tolls. While 64 percent of the 2017 tolls were paid in cash, the figure is an 8 percent decrease compared to 2016. The report states that the highway company’s automation and digitization strategy has begun to bear fruit.  In parallel with its development policy, the company opened a range of workshops to enhance safety and accident prevention. The company asserted it is working on providing enhanced assistance to drivers, vertical and horizontal road signs, fencing and control methods, enhanced surveillance network videos, road safety awareness campaigns, and the  bridge-building program.

Rabat  – On Monday, BBC reported on exclusive information about Khashoggi’s murder. According to the British news outlet, Turkish officials said that Saudi Arabia sent a “toxicologist and a chemical expert” to its consulate in Istanbul to clean up evidence of the murder. Turkish investigators have claimed that the journalist was strangled to death and his body dismembered. The Saudi team were reportedly sent before Saudi Arabia allowed Turkish police to search the Saudi consulate. Saudi Arabia has admitted that Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, first saying that he was killed in a fistfight and then that it was a premediated killing by “rogue agents.” Khashoggi’s case has brought international pressure on the Saudis to explain their role in the murder and to reveal details about the body of the journalist. Khashoggi’s sons recently spoke up in an interview with CNN. During the interview, Salah and Abdullah said they have asked Saudi Arabia to return Khashoggi’s body. “I really hope that whatever happened wasn’t painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death,” said Abdullah. Salah said that the only thing Khashoggi’s family wants is to “bury him in Al-Baqi [cemetery] in Medina with the rest of his family.” After receiving backlash from the international community, Saudi Arabia said that it has detained 18 people involved in the murder of Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia’s Human Rights Commission President Bandar bin Mohammed Al-Aiban told the UN on Monday that Saudi Arabia will prosecute all suspects involved in the murder. He said that King Salman of Saudi Arabia ordered the Saudi public prosecutor to “proceed with the investigation into this case according to the applicable laws and preparation to reaching all facts and bringing all the perpetrators to justice.” On October 23, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called on Saudi Arabia to hand over the 18 suspects in Khashoggi’s killing to stand trial in Istanbul where the murder was committed.

Rabat – “We seized a number of dictionaries showing the Western Sahara as an integral part of Morocco,” Bouzid Dahian, the head of divisional customs inspection of Bordj El Bahri, east of Algiers, told Algerian television channel Ennahar TV. He added that customs “removed the dictionaries because they contained banned maps.” During the televised interview, the journalist applauded the customs’ seizure. Algeria had previously banned a Moroccan dictionary.
Besides the banned Moroccan dictionary, Algeria also closed the stand of an Iranian publisher, claiming that his books promote Shi’ism. In 2013, the Moroccan Writers Union (EMU) denounced Algeria’s decision to ban a language dictionary produced by a Moroccan scholar and EMU member at the International Book Fair of Algiers (SILA). Morocco contends that Algeria arms, hosts, and backs the Polisario’s claims for independence in Western Sahara. Despite its support for the front, Algeria is reluctant to acknowledge its responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. However, the UN Security Council addressed a strong message to Algeria in its October 31 resolution to contribute to the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. Resolution 2440 also pressured the front to refrain from undermining the status quo of the region.

Rabat – The football game will reunite two ex-Ballon D’or and FIFA World Players of the Year: Brazilians Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, Argentinians Javier Saviola and Roberto Ayala, and Colombians Carlos Valderrama and Rene Higuita. Local football fans will also have the opportunity to see up close Italian World Champion Gianluca Zambrotta, Senegalese players El Hadji Diouf and Khalilou Fadiga, Tunisian Zoubeir Beya, Egyptian Mido, Ghanaian Abedi Pele, and Dutch Clarence Seedorf. The Sports Association of Brothers Supporting Youth, Charitable, and Social Works organized the game in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth and Sports. “We are so proud to gather and celebrate the glorious Green March,” Abu Azaitar, the renowned mixed martial artist and president of the organizing association, told the press. “People from Brazil, Colombia and Europe representing different disciplines such as football and kickboxing have come to share our moment and most importantly contribute to the humanitarian act we aim to fulfil,” he added. “I am so happy to attend such a great event, and I thank Abu Azaitar and all organizers for the chance they gave me to reunite with some friends like Said Chiba and others,” said Nader El-Sayed, the former Egyptian national team goalkeeper. Every November 6, Moroccans commemorate the Green March, when 350,000 unarmed Moroccans marched into the Sahara in 1975 to force Spain to leave Western Sahara.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows were down by 2.7 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, the Foreign Exchange Office (FEO) reported. The FEO reported the figures in its monthly foreign trade indicators for September 2018.  The increase in the deficit is caused by a larger increase in imports, up MAD 31.39 billion, than in exports, up MAD 21.81 billion. Morocco’s debt-service coverage ratio was 77.7 percent in the period, compared with 78.4 percent in the previous year. Morocco’s increase in imports was mainly driven by the purchases of energy products, up 19.6 percent; raw materials, up 19.1 percent; capital goods, up 10 percent; food products, up 8.5 percent; and finished consumer products, up 6.8 percent. Exports also increased by 7.9 percent to MAD 298.2 billion in the first nine months of 2018. The rise can be attributed to increased exports in all sectors, but particularly that of phosphates and derivatives, up 16.8 percent; automobiles, up 14.7 percent; aeronautics, up 14 percent; and agriculture and food, up 6.3 percent. FDI inflows amounted to MAD 19 billion in the 12-month period up to September 2018, down 2.7 percent compared to the same 12-month period of the previous year. The drop is the result of a higher increase in spending, up 43.6 percent, than in revenues, up 8 percent. Spending on FDI in the 12-month period amounted to MAD 8.5 billion; 37.1 percent of the spending was on debt repayments. Overall revenues from Moroccans residing abroad (MREs) were slightly down by 0.2 percent at MAD 49.7 billion in the first nine months of 2018. MREs returning home had spent a net balance of MAD 40.3 billion in the same period, compared to MAD 41.8 billion a year earlier.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI and the Rwandan president, who is also the chairman of the African Union,  “discussed the positive dynamics ad promising prospects in the bilateral relations between the kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Rwanda in all areas.” The meeting comes on the eve of the Extraordinary African Union Summit. In June 2016, King Mohammed VI received Kagame in Rabat. During his visit to Morocco, King Mohammed VI decorated Kagame with the Grand Collar of Wissam Al-Mohammadi, Morocco’s highest national Award of honor, before hosting him to an official iftar (breaking iftar) in observance of the holy month of Ramadan. In October 2016, King Mohammed VI along with a delegation visited  Uganda. During the visit, both leaders charged the signing of bilateral agreements in business, political and social sectors. The delegation that accompanied Kin Mohammed VI explored investment opportunities and partnerships in Rwanda. Among the agreements signed during King Mohammed VI’s visit to Rwanda a Memorandum of Understanding on political consultation mechanism, an air service agreement, an agreement on the exemption of visa and an agreement on security cooperation and tourism. Following Morocco’s return to the AU in 2017, King Mohammed VI expressed the country’s commitment to Africa’s development as a top priority. Kagame is one of the African leaders who welcomed Morocco’s return to the AU. In January, Kagame told Hommes d’Afrique Magazine at the 30th Summit of the African Union in Addis Ababa that “with the return of Morocco, Africa becomes greater and stronger.”

Washington D.C. – The resolution reflected recent developments and welcomed the non-occurrence of any incident that would destabilize the region. It also stressed, for the second time in a row, the need “to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.” This emphasis means that the referendum is no longer viewed as a viable option that is likely to help the parties reach a realistic political solution. It is very telling that no member of the Security Council mentioned the referendum during member states’ statements after voting for the adoption of the resolution. In addition, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and China emphasized that any political solution to the conflict should be a mutually agreed upon and reached through negotiation. Inclusion of Algeria for the first time Regardless of the duration of the MINURSO mandate, the new resolution includes substantial modifications that will prove significant for the political process. Mentioning Algeria three times in the resolution is noteworthy. The resolution’s preamble included an additional paragraph that welcomed Algeria’s decision to participate in the negotiations without conditions and in good faith. In operative paragraph three, the Security Council welcomed the acceptance by Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania to participate in the Geneva round-table to take palace in Geneva on December 5 and 6. This is the first time the Security Council resolution has mentioned Algeria in a resolution since at least 2002 and since the start of the political process in 2007. As penholder of the resolution, the U.S. had to reconcile two diametrically opposed positions. Morocco has emphasized on many occasions that it will not participate in direct negotiations so long as Algeria is not regarded as a party to the conflict. Conversely, Algeria has insisted on participating only as a neighboring state. To overcome this situation, the U.S. delegation has proposed a compromise in which Algeria is mentioned in the resolution on semi-equal footing with Morocco and Polisario. In return, Morocco and member states supporting the mandate extension for 12 months had to accept a six-month duration of MINURSO’s mandate. To be sure, the resolution has still not made Algeria a party to the negotiations. However, the very fact that Algeria is mentioned in the resolution suggests that the Security Council seems geared towards gradually involving Algeria in the upcoming negotiations. This language might open the door to new developments if Morocco plays its hands deftly. It is meaningful that there is no distinction between Morocco and Algeria in the two paragraphs where Algeria is mentioned. Had the Security Council wanted to make such distinction, it could have flagged Algeria’s participation as a “neighboring state” in that paragraph. This distinction was not added for a purpose. This, combined with the reduction of the traditional language regarding self-determination, was a point of contention in the debate that preceded the adoption of the resolution and the main reasons why Russia, Ethiopia and Bolivia abstained. The U.S. is aware that any negotiations without Algeria’s participation will not lead to any progress. Therefore, including Algeria for the first time in the resolution and inviting it to participate in all stages of the political process is a first step to make it a part of the solution. The practice of gradually amending the language of resolutions is a common practice for issues on the UN agenda. Amendments are often adopted in pieces; sometimes words, sentences, and paragraphs are added or removed, and the restructuring of paragraphs paves the way for later amendments. This does not necessarily suggest that this resolution will lead to a solution that favors Morocco’s position. Nevertheless, one would be remiss to dismiss this detail or downplay the political weight it carries for the future of the political process. In addition, a paragraph in which the Security Council calls on Morocco and the Polisario to respect their obligations concerning the ceasefire agreement—particularly for the Polisario to refrain from taking any step that would change the status quo in the buffer zone in Guerguerat and Bir Lahlou—was added to the resolution. What is striking about this paragraph is that the final version of the resolution included Tifariti as well, which was not mentioned in earlier draft versions of the resolution. This is a strong setback to the Polisario, which has long claimed that the area east of the Moroccan defense wall is a “liberated territory.” This sort of emphasis on the obligations of the Polisario was a sticking point among some members of the Security Council, who felt that the language was too strong against the Polisario. However, other members such as the United States and France seem bent on avoiding a remake of the same scenario in the region during the past two years as a result of Polisario’s attempts to change the status quo and impose a fait accompli in the buffer zone. Thus, the Polisario is unlikely to take provocative steps like those it has taken in the past two years. Room for progress Aside from the new language mentioned, the resolution has not brought anything new for Morocco with regards to its repeated calls for the need to conduct a census in the Tindouf camps. It should be emphasized that Morocco has still not succeed in changing the language of the resolution regarding the registration of refugees in the Tindouf camps. The same language of 2011 has been repeated without any change. One could say Morocco will have achieved something in this regard when the Security Council adds an operative paragraph clearly calling on Algeria to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to conduct a census in the camps. The same can be said about the Moroccan autonomy plan. While it is true that Resolution 2440 gives preeminence in the preamble of the resolution to Morocco’s autonomy plan and welcomes “serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution,” this language should not be regarded as a breakthrough in favor of Morocco. With the exception of Resolution 2285 of 2016,  since 2007 the Security Council has always welcomed the Moroccan proposal while just taking note of the Polisario’s counter-proposal. Therefore, the language adopted in Resolution 2440 should not be viewed be as a new victory for Morocco. One can only talk about a real breakthrough when and if the Security Council adopts an operative paragraph expressing, in unambiguous terms, that the Moroccan autonomy plan is the only way forward. Morocco and the U.S. after Nikki Haley’s resignation An important factor to consider in the next phase is the resignation of the current United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who played an important role in the Security Council’s adoption of two resolutions in favor of Morocco, especially resolution 2351 in April 2017. Nikki Haley had a great margin of autonomy in the decision-making process whether in top priority issues for the U.S. such as the Palestinian issue, the nuclear agreement with Iran, North Korea, and Russia, or on issues of lesser importance for the U.S. Her closeness to the president, his daughter, and his son-in-law enabled her to have direct access to him. Whereas the U.S. president himself is known for rough, undiplomatic language against both adversaries and allies, Ambassador Haley, known for her charisma and diplomatic skills, was a welcomed addition to the Trump Administration. She is also considered a moderate representative of the Republican Party, which has often responded positively to Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara issue. Moroccan diplomacy has taken advantage of Haley’s independence and her responsiveness to Morocco to reach two council resolutions in favor of Morocco. Moroccan Ambassador to the United Nations, Omar Hilal, said of Haley’s resignation: “We will miss her. I worked with her two years and from the beginning it was a warm, personal relationship and Morocco will never forget her.” That Morocco’s ambassador to the UN was among the few foreign diplomats who bid farewell to Haley on such friendly terms shows her responsiveness to Morocco’s proposals and her willingness to sympathize with Morocco. With Haley’s resignation, the role of National Security Adviser John Bolton, who is close to President Trump, will be more consequential in U.S. policy-making concerning the Western Sahara issue. Not only is he a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, he is also familiar with the ins and outs of the conflict, as in the 1990s he served as an assistant to the UN’s previous envoy for the Western Sahara conflict, James Baker. After Bolton became the national security adviser in April, he became an influential figure for various U.S. foreign policy issues, including the Western Sahara issue. His influence was demonstrated through Resolution 2414, which extended the MINURSO mandate for only six months for the first time since 2008. Many analysts attributed Haley’s resignation to the narrow margin of her independence in influencing U.S. foreign policy since the appointment of Bolton and Mike Pompeo. Given the character of Bolton and his closeness to the U.S. president, he will play a major role in the decision-making process in the U.S. administration in the coming period. The next United States ambassador to the United Nations, is therefore, unlikely to have the same margin of independence as Haley. Consequently, Morocco must make more efforts than ever before to convince the U.S. administration of the Moroccan position and avoid any development that would put it under unprecedented pressure.

Rabat – The speech will be broadcast on Moroccan television channels and radio stations. The day commemorates Moroccans’ retaking of Western Sahara after the Spanish left in 1975. Last year, at the 42nd anniversary, King Mohammed VI reaffirmed Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. In the speech, the monarch emphasized Morocco’s established principles and framework of reference. Morocco considers the principles outlined in the King’s speech as the foundations of the Moroccan position on Western Sahara. The four principles include Morocco’s refusal of any solution the Western Sahara conflict other “than within the framework of Morocco’s full sovereignty over its Sahara and the Autonomy Initiative,” said the King. The monarch added that Morrocco will “draw lessons from past experience,” “ensure full compliance with the terms of reference adopted by the UN Security Council,” and completely reject “any transgression or attempt to infringe on Morocco’s legitimate rights or its best interests.” The Green March is a historical event that reminds the nation of King Hassan II and his famous speech when he called on citizens on October 16 to stage a peaceful march into Western Sahara to end Spain’s colonization of the territory. “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said. Citizens from the east to the north took the King’s speech to heart. More than 350,000 Moroccans took part in the peaceful march.

Rabat – According to a note by the High Commission for Planning (HCP), 122,000 jobs were created: 118,000 in urban areas and 4,000 in rural areas. The service sector and “industry including traditional industry” generated 98,000 jobs and 19,000 jobs, respectively. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing generated 9,000 jobs, while construction and public works lost 4,000 jobs. HCP added that, during the same period, there were just over 1 million unemployed people, down by 64,000 people at the national level since the same period last year. The unemployment rate in urban areas fell from 14.9 percent to 14.3 percent. In rural areas it fell from 4.6 percent to 3.9 percent. However, the unemployment rate remains relatively high among youth aged 15-24 (27.5 percent). The rate among women and those with degrees is 13.8 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.  The unemployment rate of those with a vocational training certificate is 23.9 percent: 36.5 percent for women and 19.3 percent for men.  HCP found that approximately 57 percent of unemployed people have never worked before, and 67.7 percent have been unemployed for a year or more. Approximately 26.8 percent are unemployed because they were fired or their employer’s activity was suspended.

Rabat- Attempts at irregular migration continue to pressure Moroccan authorities and make headlines in Morocco. In a patrol mission on Saturday, the navy rescued the irregular migrants, Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans sailing from Nador in northeast Morocco and Tangier together in makeshift boats, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The navy units successfully returned the migrants to Ksar Sghir in Tangier and Nador in the Rif region. As the Moroccan government continues to fight irregular migration through road and sea to Europe, many Moroccan migrants are persistent in trying to leave the country. Since September, when a young woman named Hayat died from navy gunfire while on a migrant speed boat, Moroccans have protested the harsh measure and the government has reported on large numbers of intercepted immigrants. Late in October, the Moroccan navy intercepted four boats carrying 143 migrants off the coasts of Tangier and Nador. EU officials announced earlier in October they would seek to extend economic and logistic support to help Morocco curb irregular immigration. Authorities also stated that current irregular migration attempts had surged 150 percent along the western Mediterranean route from the levels recorded between 2003 and 2015.

Rabat – Squalli died Monday morning from an incurable disease, Moroccan media reported. Born in Fez in 1932, Squalli wrote the national anthem in 1969 under the reign of King Hassan II. Before 1969, the anthem was used only in melody. The idea of writing lyrics to the national anthem came after the Moroccan national football team qualified to participate in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico for the first time. There are two stories behind the writing of the anthem’s lyrics. One story says that King Hassan II launched a competition to compose the anthem’s lyrics, and Squalli’s lyrics gained royal and popular approval. َAnother version says that King Hassan II ordered Squalli to write the lyrics for the melody. Leo Morgan, a French captain and chief of music during the French occupation of Morocco, had composed the national anthem’s melody. The Frenchman wrote the anthem’s music during the reign of Sultan Moulay Youssef. The melody of the national anthem was in use without lyrics before Morocco’s independence in 1956.  Squalli also wrote numerous books, especially children’s books. Squalli received a BA degree in literature from Al-Quaraouiyine University in 1951 and later became a professor there. Squalli joined the Royal Cabinet in 1956, where he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then he became an associate professor at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities in Rabat in 1964. The Moroccan author had worked as an inspector general at the Ministry of Education since 1971. Sakali had also been a member of the Union of Moroccan Writers since 1967. Throughout his career, Squalli achieved various awards for his literary works, including the Morocco Grand Prize in 1982 and the international prize of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia  for children’s literature in 1992.

Rabat – A government official told the BBC that the 78 students, along with at least three others, including the school’s principal, were abducted on Monday morning. Regional governor Adolphe Lele L’Afrique in a statement said separatist militias were to blame. Cameroon’s North-West and South-West regions have both experienced secessionist movements in recent years. Militias have made calls for independence for the two English-speaking provinces.  The militias rose to prominence in 2017 after Cameroon’s security forces cracked down on protests. Teachers and lawyers led the demonstrations over what they say was the government’s failure to properly recognize the English legal and education systems in the North-West and South-West.  They accused the government of instead favoring the traditional French-speaking system. In response, the militias have called for the creation of a new state named Ambazonia. Cameroon’s English-speaking minority makes up about 20 percent of the country’s total population.  No group has yet claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, but Reverend Fonki Samuel Forba, the moderator of a Presbyterian church in the area, told the BBC that he had spoken to kidnappers.  “They don’t want any ransom. All they want is for us to close the schools. We have promised to close down the schools,” he said. “We hope and pray they release the kids and the teachers.”

Rabat – When students return from the fall break on Wednesday, November 7, they will follow the traditional time-table for school for half a week, the ministry said in a statement. Public schools usually open at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. with a 2 hour-lunch break from 12 noon to 2 p.m. Beginning Monday, November 12, students will follow the new-time table that the government set on November 1. The new time-table was the second to be announced in the space of seven days. When the ministry announced the newest time-table would take effect November 12, the public wondered what time-table to follow this week. The new-time table stipulates that primary schools will start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1 and 3 p.m. from Monday to Friday. The time-table concerns schools with one teacher per classroom. For schools with two teachers per classroom, one group of students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3:30 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The other group will start at 11:30 a.m. and end at 5:30 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1:30 and 3.30 p.m. The two groups will go to school on Saturday as well. For schools in rural areas, students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3 p.m. with a 30-minute lunch break from Monday to Friday. For rural schools having two teachers per classroom, one group of students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 1:30 p.m. while the other group will start at 1:30 p.m. and end at 6 p.m. The two groups will go to school on Saturday, too. Middle and high school will start at 9 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. with two options for their two-hour lunch: between 12 noon and 2 p.m or between 1 and 3 p.m. Schools will go back to the traditional time-table in the spring.

“Nothing will be like before,” Al Ahdath quoted foreign minister Nasser Bourita as saying. The Moroccan minister was referring to Mauritania’s growing role as an important stakeholder in the Western Sahara dossier. Bourita’s remarks came just hours after his meeting on Friday with Mauritanian President Ould Abdelaziz. Bourita, on a state visit to Nouakchott, Mauritania, extended a “special royal message” to the Mauritanian president, according to reports. Bourita, as quoted by the daily, expressed great satisfaction with his visit to the Mauritanian capital. He highlighted the friendly atmosphere of his meeting with the Mauritanian leader. According to Bourita, both countries are willing to set the stage for critical diplomatic gains in regional affairs. He asserted, “There is sincere political will on both sides to impart a new dynamic to bilateral relations in all domains.” Bourita said that his discussion with Ould Abdelaziz was constructive. They “warmly and candidly” spoke about regional matters, especially recent developments on political and security fronts. Indirectly addressing Mauritania’s role in the expected political settlement in the region’s longest dispute in Western Sahara, Bourita stressed that the next months will witness unprecedented diplomatic overtures. “In the near future there will be important changes in line with the new [bilateral] dynamic.” The Al Ahdath report is not the first time Bourita has expressed optimism about political settlement prospects in Western Sahara. In a recent interview with French outlet Le Monde, the head of Moroccan diplomacy said that he expects all parties in the Western Sahara dispute to be more pragmatic and ready to make concessions. He argued that the path chosen by UN personal envoy for Western Sahara Horst Kohler will push all stakeholders towards “more actions and less rhetoric.” Mauritania shares Bourita’s optimism. Before the Moroccan minister’s visit Friday, a number of high-profile Mauritanian politicians had already expressed their country’s readiness to find common ground on bilateral and regional affairs “should Morocco take the first step.” In an interview with Al Ahdath earlier this year, Sidi Mohamed Ould Maham, Mauritania’s communications minister and government spokesperson said, “If Morocco takes one step forward towards Mauritania, you should rest assured that Mauritania will take ten steps forward.”

By Josh Babb Rabat – Speaking with CNN in Washington, D.C., the two brothers said they have asked Saudi authorities to return Khashoggi’s body. Without doing so, they said, Saudi Arabia is denying Khashoggi’s family the ability to properly grieve or gain a sense of closure in the aftermath of his death. “I really hope that whatever happened wasn’t painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death,” said Abdullah. “All what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi [cemetery] in Medina with the rest of his family,” Salah added. Khashoggi, an opinion contributor for the Washington Post, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-person Saudi hit squad on October 2. Turkish authorities claim Khashoggi was strangled soon after entering the consulate and his body was dismembered shortly after.  The Post reported that Turkish investigators are also looking into the possibility that the hit-squad dissolved Khashoggi’s body in acid on the grounds of the consulate, with particular attention being paid to a well on the property. Authorities also searched the sewer system in the immediate area last week. Saudi Arabia has presented several narratives surrounding the death of Khashoggi. Initially they denied all involvement, but carefully managed leaks by Turkish investigators and newspapers have forced the Saudis to revise their position several times. The Saudis finally admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated manner in late October but claimed the operation was the result of “rogue agents.”  Riyadh continues to vehemently deny that either King Salman or Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) had any advanced knowledge of the plot.  Saudi prosecutors have arrested 18 people in connection with Khashoggi’s killing, many with ties to Saudi security services. Turkey has demanded that the Saudis extradite them for trial in Istanbul, but Saudi foreign minister Adel Al-Jubeir has insisted that they will instead face prosecution in Riyadh.  The death of Khashoggi has ignited international outcry and complicated the United States close relationship with Saudi Arabia. President Trump viewed the Saudis as a critical ally in the Middle East as his administration postures to contain Iranian influence in the region.  Both Salah and Abdullah Khashoggi fear that in the aftermath of their father’s death the politicization of the murder threatens to both obfuscate the truth and the legacy of their father’s work.  News broke last week that in phone calls with both National Security Advisor John Bolton and Jared Kushner, MBS had called Khashoggi a “dangerous Islamist” who had supported the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has long been considered a terrorist group by Saudi Arabia. When asked how Khashoggi should be remembered, Salah replied, “as a moderate man who has common values with everyone … a man who loved his country.” He added, “Jamal was never a dissident. He believed in the monarchy that it is the thing that is keeping the country together. And he believed in the transformation that it is going through.” The brothers stressed that they are waiting for the full investigation from Saudi Arabia to come to a close and for all the facts to surface before drawing their conclusions.  “The King has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice. And I have faith in that. This will happen. Otherwise Saudi wouldn’t have started an internal investigation,” Salah said.

Rabat – The early cold wave and snow have taken Morocco by surprise, especially in relation to the government’s plans to handle the consequences of the weather.  The early snowfalls beginning late in October in the Atlas Mountains towns and cities of Azrou, Midelt, Boulemane, Taza, El Hajeb, Imouzzer, and Ifrane brought joy to many Moroccans.  But a week of rain has flooded cities like Casablanca, and 1.2 meters of snow has isolated people in the mountains of Ouarzazate, Boulemane, Azilal, Haouz, and Beni Mellal. Many Moroccans on social media expressed relief that the first week of heavy rain coincided with the fall school break who were spared from going to school in severe weather. Yet, meteorologists have forecasted more rain and low temperatures for the week ahead. While floods caused traffic disruptions in Casablanca and Rabat, snow has blocked the highways and roads leading to Azrou and Timahdite in Ifrane province for hours, according to Alyaoum24. The cold wave also preceded the full implementation of the government’s winter plan for remote areas. Last year, winter snowstorms prevented travel on 38 national roads and shut down almost 900 rural schools. The weather prompted the government to launch an “exceptional mobilization” mission to open the roads to areas isolated by snow. The mission was set to benefit about 514,000 people in 22 different provinces under the supervision of departments from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Royal Gendarmerie, and the Auxiliary Forces and Civil Protection. At the time, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani noted the insufficient number of available snowplows despite the government’s efforts. Not much has changed this season. Moroccans have denounced the lack of snow removal equipment following the death of a shepherd in Taza who had been missing for a week. The shepherd was found frozen on Sunday. One Moroccan on social media also noted that the civil protection members borrowed “crutches from local citizens to look for the shepherd.” “When they lost hope, they stepped back, while citizens continued to search for him until they found him dead, frozen in the snow,” the Facebook user alleged. In response to the suffering of people in the mountainous areas, like every year, King Mohammed VI has given instructions to the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity to mobilize and provide the necessary care.

Rabat – The government council validated Benrazzouk’s appointment when it met Thursday, November 1. OMPIC is responsible to protect industrial and commercial property, such as brands, patents, and industrial designs. Benrazzouk will take over from Adil El Maliki, whom King Mohammed VI appointed governor of Essaouira province in August. Benrazzouk has been the director of Maroc PME, formerly the national agency for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), since 2014. During his time within Maroc PME, Benrazzouk concluded a new contractual framework between the state and Maroc PME for 2013-2020. Since then, Benrazzouk has supported SMEs by scaling up the agency’s flagships programs Moussanada and Imtiaz.   The Moussanada program aims to improve the productivity of 500 SMEs per year and improve their competitiveness in terms of cost, time, and quality. The Imtiaz program aims to finance 50 development projects presented by SMEs with high growth potential to facilitate access to bank credit and support the most successful companies to make higher revenues and be more profitable. Maroc PME also has several ambitious objectives to fund small and medium-sized enterprises. Larbi Benrazzouk graduated as an engineer from Rabat’s Mohammedia School of Engineering. He also holds a specialized graduate studies degree in patrimonial and financial management from Montpelier University.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) seized the ecstasy pills in a joint border control operation with customs agents early Monday morning, Maghreb Arab Press reported. Police have arrested three suspects, including one woman, in a car registered in the Netherlands, DGSN said in a statement.  The ecstasy tablets were carefully concealed in the car’s trailer. Tangier’s judicial police “have opened a judicial investigation under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office to determine the ins and outs of this case and to apprehend possible accomplices,” added the statement. Many people, especially young people, consume ecstasy pills worldwide because they amplify human sensations and give an excited feeling. The ecstasy pill, also widely known as “the love pill,” affects the central nervous system causing hallucinations and psychoactive effects. “Sometimes users may experience intense anxiety, or feel so depressed three or four days after taking the drug that they think they need to see a doctor,” according to Drug-Free World Foundation. In March, DGSN seized 7,402 ecstasy pills, in addition to 475 kilograms of cocaine, and 3 kilograms of hashish from a 34 -year-old man. The national police arrested another 32-year -old man in January, for carrying 370 ecstasy pills  in Marrakech.

Rabat – The games include the Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti, Bahrainian, Jordananian, and Egyptian militaries. Morocco and Lebanon were invited as observers to the “Arab Shield” exercises. The maneuvers, held at the Mohammed Naguib military base, west of Alexandria, will give the six countries’ forces experience in urban warfare and prepare them for possible joint military action. The primary aims of the exercises are to exchange expertise and develop military relations and tactics to face common challenges that might threaten stability in the region. The games come only one month after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met the foreign ministers of the six countries, in addition to those of Oman and Qatar. According to the Washington Post, Pompeo expressed the US’ desire to advance a Sunni alliance uniting America’s Middle East partners against Shiite and non-Arab Iran at the New York meeting. The Egyptian military did not mention any link between the war games and the proposed alliance. Egypt may be approaching the alliance with caution due to its sectarian undertones.

The Juventus player has been linked with a move to join Leo Messi’s team as Barcelona is looking to reinforce its defensive line. According to Mundo Deportivo, Napoli’s Raul Albiol and Lokomotiv Moscow’s Benedikt Howedes and Vedran Corluka are all included in Barcelona’s shortlist. Benatia, who is also the captain of the Moroccan national team, has already attracted the interest of big clubs, including l’Olympique Marseille, Arsenal, and AC Milan. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined the Old Lady on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich in 2016. After his one-year season with Juventus, the Italian football giant converted Benatia’s loan to a permanent deal. In 2017 Juventus signed the Moroccan player with a three-year deal worth €17 million. Earlier this year, France Football voted Benatia best Maghreb player in 2017, ahead of Algeria’s Riyad Mahrez and Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech.

Clearly, the majority of people in Basra suffer from food shortages, poor medical services, power outages, and many other problems. However, there’s more at stake in the Basra protests than these initial complications. To most people, the unrest in Basra is a sign of growing frustration and anger among Iraqis in general over corruption. Simply put, it comes at a time when most Iraqis no longer trust their politicians, officials, or even religious leaders. “The revolution will continue. It will continue until our demands are met!” shouted a man into a CNN camera, as reported by Ben Wedeman on Friday, September 7. It happened just a day or two after the unusual volume of demonstrations had significantly increased in Basra’s streets and squares.  The protests in Basra still continue. They usually start in the morning but also gain momentum after sunset, when the temperature usually drops to more comfortable levels. These protests appear to address serious concerns over the quality and conditions of life in the city. The water supply to Iraq’s third-largest city is usually contaminated by salt; power cuts continue at times of high temperatures; and health care is far below the average world standard. People in the coastal oil-producing city suffer more than just these immediate inconveniences. The unemployment rate is high and has been constant in recent months. There’s also that constant threat of Post-Saddam Hussein’s Iraq: corruption. Much of Iraq‘s wealth comes from its southern provinces. The area sits atop most of the country’s oil reserves and fertile soil. It also contains the only deep-water port in the country, Um Qasr. Unfortunately, this wealth does not seem to benefit the people of Basra, nor of Iraq as a whole. The wealth does not stay in Basra to reduce these discomforts. This very sad reality has begun bringing about tangible frustration and tension. No doubt the city, which sits on Shat al-Arab, a waterway system of canals now brimming with dirt and waste, endures a lot of pain. For decades, it was a city of economic prosperity, sophisticated trade, and co-existence. Much of the charm the city has long celebrated is now fading away. Why, then, should they not demonstrate against the local government, take revolutionarily to the streets, or even torch the buildings? Still, viewing this latest unrest from this perspective is basically a crude attempt at misinformation. It is deeply unconvincing since what is happening now is no more than the spark that lights the fire. To borrow CNN’s Ben Wedeman’s words, “There’s more at stake in the Basra protests than dirty water and oil.” It is simply another chapter of a sad and long tragedy that never ends.  There was already a growing feeling of disappointment in the political system, with many Iraqis pointing to the widespread corruption in their country. That is where all problems find their roots in contemporary Iraq. That is where the blame should be laid. This argument raises more questions about who is really to blame. For many years, Iraqis had to turn to Saddam’s Hussein’s regime for their basic needs: food, health care, security, etc. When it collapsed in 2003, just months after the Americans and their anti-Saddam Iraqi allies took over, the organs of the state declined, and more Iraqis turned to their local communities, tribal leaders, and militia groups for assistance. The cost was high as civil violence began to run rampant throughout the country and seriously undercut the entire state. Violence affected not just its credibility, but nearly every component of the regime. So, along with the rising sectarian violence, insurgency and crime have been problems of a de facto failed state.  Two years ago, thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad, demanding jobs, health care, social justice, and their basic human rights.  The demonstrations extended into the “Green Zone,” the most heavily guarded area of the capital city where most foreign and local officials, diplomats, and leaders live. These marches came in response to the formation of the government. At the time, many Iraqis considered the government as not differing significantly from previous corrupt governments. Again, this reason is credible enough to inspire the spate of mass anti-corruption marches in Baghdad, Basra, or elsewhere in Iraq. It is deeply convincing. Yet, Iraq’s problems are, in fact, of more serious concerns than just the shape of the government.  Basra’s decline, as well as that of the whole country, began in the early 1980s with the eight-year Iraq-Iran war. Thousands of the city’s residents had to leave their homes, businesses, and families in search of security in the northern provinces. The war ended, but their struggle continued even more painfully due to different factors: US-imposed sanctions, the Saddam Hussein regime’s crackdown on civil liberties, and the rise of violent militant protests by many Shi’a groups. Iraq became a sad place to live. Dirt was everywhere and so were collapsed buildings and thousands of decapitated date palms. There were no signs of recovery or hope.  Of course, it was not meant to be this way. The overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime was meant to lead Iraq into economic prosperity, political stability, and democracy. It was meant to end the vicious plague of bureaucracy, wealth concentration, extreme poverty, unemployment, etc. It was meant to usher in an age of justice, welfare, and growth. However, things went poorly, more so than any pessimist could have imagined. Crime, poverty, and the plague of sectarian violence have now completely torn the country apart, without any end in sight. As the strife continues and Iraqis continue to hold doubts about the future, people may have no other choice but to rebel.  High on the list of Iraqi problems is terrorism, not just because of the danger it represents, but also because the country has no clear strategy to fight it. Presumably, some may note that the two-decade long war on terrorism drained Iraq of all of its energy and resources. Radical Islamic groups like Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the broader jihadist movement in the region have always been “a learning enemy,” as General Dempsey once remarked. They have always known how to use and manipulate populations. This explains why it took many years before the Iraqi military could gain significant ground in their strongholds.  Again, to anyone knowledgeable enough about the real danger these two groups and other radical affiliations have represented not just in Iraq, but also in the entire world, this reality may justify the different Iraqi governments’ hardships and challenges. However, it also sends another message, but in a far darker way. Iraq did not have a strategy. They still do not! A serious strategy could have brought about an end to the mess these groups created. What happened is quite the opposite!   Seemingly no one in Iraq believes that their consecutive governments have had a strategy to fight and defeat terrorism. What Iraqis have seen instead is what observers usually call “micromanagement of military policy.” The policy, which caused division in society, has become a civil war between different Iraqi communities. These governments were happy to take recruits from southern Iraq and mostly Shi’a-populated provinces and send them to the front lines. But they had little time for the Sunni Iraqis. While the war on terrorism continues in the wrong way, many Sunni militants in northern Iraq have joined ISIS and Al-Qaeda. This very sad reality still causes chaos to reign over order and hatred and intolerance to prevail over unity and co-existence. Meanwhile, Baghdad is still gripped by political paralysis, which has been left entirely unchallenged except by the Shi’a cleric and the implacable foe of the US-led occupation, Muqtada al-Sadr. It is still far from deciding on the makeup of a real inclusive political system.  A tweet by al-Sadr last week said, “I hope you don’t think that the Basra revolutionaries are just a bubble … Quickly release Basra’s money and give it to clean hands, to start at once with immediate and future development projects. And beware of complacency and negligence.” The story may seem laughably thin, as many Iraqis know how strategically he uses propaganda. Yet, it sends a positive message. Iraqis need change!  Now the unrest in Basra, along with the strife within all Iraqi cities, dominates news headlines worldwide. Iraq may have few options to ameliorate this difficult situation. There are few effective paths to follow. If anything could prove to benefit a stable, safe, and prosperous country, it should be the strict path of democracy. Until then, the story of Iraq remains a sad one. Indeed, it is a tragedy with no end yet in sight.

New York – The conference, held at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in New York, brought together noted theologians, representatives of the US State Department, analysts, and others for two days of open discussions on a variety of subjects central to Muslims, Christians, and Jews.  Morocco figured prominently in the discussion, and Dr. Abdelhak Azzouzi, professor of international relations and political science, spoke on the panel about the polemic of cultural hegemony between moderation and extremism. Morocco, which is at the helm of fighting ideological extremism in Africa, has much to contribute to the discussion of how a culture of integration, tolerance, and respect can guard against infiltration by extremists—violent jihadists and Muslim Brotherhood ideologues—who seek to hijack the discussion on intercultural differences. It can do so through preventive outreach, guarding mosques against jihadist influence, and offering opportunities to vulnerable populations targeted by radical groups like ISIS.  Today’s political climate does a tremendous disservice to peaceful, law-abiding Muslims in the United States, as well as Muslims residing in other countries. Unfortunately, the Islamists who work to sow divisions between Muslim communities and non-Muslims in the West contribute to the emergence of extreme ideas and ideological threats. For that reason, the conference was a good way to bring all players together to better understand the bigger picture: There is a vibrant discussion within Muslim religious communities about various issues, as well as the direction and the future of these communities, similar to other religious communities. Furthermore, while the Muslim world is diverse, much of that does not come through in the type of sensationalist information that reaches the average American, who is ignorant about these communities beyond what these massive organizations and their spokespeople have to say. The way to combat these misunderstandings is to assist individual communities with forming their own representative organizations that will reflect their values. At the same time, working with diverse communities to create a centralized system, carefully monitored and free from politicized influences will ensure transparency, bring more and different types of people to the table, and perhaps work to discourage bad-faith actors from hijacking the discussion. In the past, the American government supported Muslim Brotherhood front organizations, such as the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), Islamic Relief, and others, which have monopolized the discussion on Islam and issues affecting Muslims to the detriment of all other voices. These organizations have used their platforms to shut down all other voices within the diverse Muslim communities in the United States, presenting American Muslims as monolithic supporters of political Islam. Rather than addressing issues central to the interests of individual communities—education, access to services, understanding US history and government, and outreach to other organizations and communities—these self-appointed spokespeople have focused the discussion on creating a grievance culture and centering foreign agendas at the forefront of the discussion.  CAIR and  ISNA are unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land trial, which brought down a network of charities laundering money for terrorist organizations. Islamic Relief is under investigation for its alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, which funds a number of terrorist organizations in the Middle East. These organizations have become dominant voices in the media, discrediting all other groups as “fringe” and presenting themselves as the only legitimate and mainstream representatives of Islam in the United States.  As a result of these efforts, many American Muslims have become disenfranchised from both the political process and community organization. When wealthy lobby groups, such as those affiliated with these Muslim Brotherhood fronts, hijack discussions with members of Congress and the administration thanks to high level networking, generous campaign donations (often from suspect foreign sources), and flashy public relations, what hope is there for independent community organizations which do not rely on Muslim Brotherhood donations for support?   Giving media platforms only to one type of practicing Muslim ignores the diversity of voices from across the religious spectrum, which engage in internal theological discussions and debates throughout the many communities in the United States. By presenting a monolithic view of Islam to the American public, Islamist organizations have ensured that a certain stereotype of Muslims as dishonest in their political intentions will be perpetuated among those who get the bulk of their news about Islam from news stories about terrorism. To that end, the United States should also be working with other countries, its Muslim allies, who are likewise dedicated to eradicating extremist ideologues, and supporting peaceful, constructive, and forward-looking conversations within their local and global communities. Conferences, such as this one, are a good start. But there is also room for smaller working groups; practical skill building workshops with different communities and with US embassies and immigration staffers; and joint activities which facilitate humanization and understanding of everyone involved.   During the course of the conference, individuals like evangelical pastor Bob Roberts, Jr., from Texas spoke about working to create welcoming, apolitical environments for Christian pastors and imams to interact and share the message of inclusion with their congregations. Moroccan-Americans in New York (MANY), led by Simo Elaissaoui, is a local community organization inclusive to Moroccans of all faiths which has been hosting joint dinners with members of the American Jewish community in relaxed social settings devoid of political agendas and oversight. The Muslim Americans Leadership Alliance (MALA), headed by Zainab Khan, and represented by Chief of Staff Jean Schindler at the conference, engages young Muslim Americans of assorted background in cultural activities and engages and humanizes its audiences through representation of individual Muslim American experiences and stories.  These organizations have worked in tandem with other organizations, such as the American Sephardi Federation, headed by Jason Guberman Pfeffer, who spoke about the Sephardic experience in building bridges between the East and the West, for joint cultural programming and understanding of each other’s histories, interests, and ways to work together to promote good relations. Perhaps in the future, Morocco will share the wealth of its successful experience in interfaith and inter-ethnic understanding—such as its tolerant imam training program—by sending a graduate of its seminal imam training center as a model for future such efforts among other participants.  Meanwhile, the message of the conference was clear: There may be many misunderstandings, and communication could use a great deal of improvement, but everyone who was in the room was committed to open dialogue, learning from one another, and implementing specific advice towards the kind of changes that can bring even more people looking to share in relationship and community-building in the near future.  Learning from successful historical precedents—such as Morocco’s long-standing relationship with the United States—can only benefit both countries and shape a more optimistic outlook towards shaping the narrative and the vision for future relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.

Rabat – A week after the shepherd’s disappearance, a group of Taza inhabitants found the body of Hamid Baali buried in the snow. A video has gone viral on social media that shows the shepherd’s body covered in snow. The shepherd had gone to the mountain to save his flock from the snowstorm. Locals who noticed Baali’s absence called the authorities to search for the shepherd. Social media users strongly condemned Baali’s death and the lack of a quick response to save his life. Internet users widely shared the shepherd’s picture, mourning his death, and criticizing the lack of snow removal equipment to search for him. One Facebook user expressed surprise and anger, saying that it was shocking to see civil protection members “borrowing crutches from local citizens to look for the shepherd. When they lost hope, they stepped back, while citizens continued to search for him until they found him dead, frozen in the snow.” Some Moroccan Facebook users claimed that Royal Gendarmerie members and authorities had not started searching for the shepherd until the sixth day after his disappearance. Morocco’s mountainous regions have been experiencing low temperatures and large snowfalls since October.  Snowfalls of 1.7 meters were reported on the reliefs of the High and Middle Atlas and peaks of the Rif Mountains at the end of October. Every year, freezing weather causes discomfort and mass suffering in mountainous regions across Morocco. Every year, King Mohammed VI instructs the government and the Mohammed V Foundation to mobilize its teams and offer humanitarian assistance to the inhabitants of the region affected by low temperatures. Yesterday, the foundation released a statement to announce the launch of a preventive medical campaign to counteract temperature drops in Morocco. The first phase of the initiative was launched on November 3 in the Midelt region in central Morocco.

By Ryan Kirk Rabat – I had the chance to interview Naelle on a train between Casablanca and Mohammedia and hear about her experiences growing up in Morocco, her decision to start a YouTube channel, being bullied in high school while dealing with racist comments, and whether she could see herself living in Morocco again full-time.  Born in South Korea, Naelle describes herself as a “mix of everything.” She has lived in the US, Canada, Morocco, Kenya, and is now back in South Korea. Her diverse upbringing is reflected in her YouTube channel’s name: “Moonwha Jjambbong,” which is a Korean phrase that means “Culture Mumbo-Jumbo” or “Melange of Culture.” (Jjambbong is a noodle dish in Korea that is a mix of many things.) She started her channel in February 2018 at the urging of friends. “Lots of people were saying, ‘Why don’t you do YouTube?,’ so it was the nudge of other people that got me started,” she said. Within a couple of months, she was known across Morocco, especially among young people who listen to K-pop and love Korean culture. Fans spread her channel through Facebook groups and some of her videos were viewed as many as 140,000 times.  “I did not expect this many followers … I thought maybe 2,000 at the most. I don’t know where all you guys came from! It was mind-blowing. I think I got lucky. Thankfully, I hit a spot where Moroccans were really wanting to hear a Korean person talk about Morocco.” When asked why she thinks Korean culture has become so popular in Morocco, she points to the entertainment industry: “People start off with Korean music or Korean dramas, whatever entertainment content Korea has produced, and you just get hooked. It’s very predictable, but very addicting. So if you’re hooked on one area of a culture, then you just get interested in their languages and customs, so I think that’s what happened in Morocco.” Naelle’s most popular videos focus on her interest in Moroccan food, culture, and language. “From my observation, people are more interested in me speaking about Moroccan culture rather than me introducing Korean culture to them. They already know all the words in Darija and the cultural ideas, but they’re really entertained that’s it me saying it.” Despite all the popularity, not all of Naelle’s experiences in Morocco have been positive. “Growing up in Morocco, to be completely honest, wasn’t very nice. Back then Koreans were far more rare, and kids were very intrigued by my face and my cultural background. Junior high kids are not always the nicest when it comes to expressing their interest, so they would say a lot of ‘interesting comments’ that would be considered racist today.”     In many ways, Naelle’s channel has brought a lot of redemption to her relationship with Morocco. “I’m really thankful that people have gotten more interested in Korean culture – I’m thrilled that people are interested in my culture. I’m really grateful.” She now has fans across the country and is planning an event to meet them all in December in Casablanca or Rabat. The event will include storytelling, photo-taking, and even some musical performances.   So how has her life changed since starting her channel? “Honestly it hasn’t. I just go to the grocery store and get my milk and do my editing … nobody really recognizes me at all in Korea. I’m a very, very ordinary person.”  When asked if she could foresee herself spending more time in Morocco in the future, she commented that “it would be very difficult for me to move here, all the way, but if this goes on and it gets bigger, I definitely see myself coming here a lot more often.”   Tens of thousands of young Moroccans are really hoping that is the case!

Rabat – On Saturday, Wydad Fez, commonly known as Wydad Athletic Club of Fez (WAF), surprised the football community by eliminating the reigning champions, Raja Club Athletic (RCA). After a few failed attempts to score the opening goal, Raja Casablanca got the first goal with its veteran left winger, Abdelilah Hafidi, in the 19th minute of the game. Wydad Fez leveled the score following a counterattack by the substitute Azeddine Baala in the 75th minute. The match regulation time ended in a tie, as did the extra time, taking both teams to a penalty shootout. Raja’s striker Mouhcine Iajour was the first to miss, but then Raja’s goalkeeper gave them hope by blocking WAF’s next penalty.  But Raja’s Omar Boutayeb’s penalty shot went wild, allowing WAF to reach its very first Throne Cup final where they will face Nahdat Berkane (RSB). RSB reached the final by defeating the reigning CAF Champions League winner Wydad de Casablanca (WAC). WAF is currently playing in Morocco’s second division, ranking 14th out of 16 teams. The club was founded in 1948 in Fez.

Rabat – The first phase of the campaign, according to a statement from the foundation, was launched on November 3 in the Midelt region in central Morocco. The initiative aims to provide humanitarian assistance to regions affected by the cold weather. The Foundation carried out a medical campaign in the town of Boumia, which is located in the Midelt Province in the Drâa-Tafilalet region. The  campaign will offer medical services, including general medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, maternal health, dentistry, ophthalmology, biology, radiology, and screening for physical disability in order to manufacture the appropriate equipment, according to the statement. The operation will also raise awareness and warn citizens in the region about cold weather-related diseases, including chronic illnesses, respiratory diseases, and rheumatism. In its medical caravan, the foundation is carrying seven fully-equipped medical units and pharmaceutical supplies in order to provide the necessary care and meet the demands of the populations under the best conditions. The statement added that social workers, volunteer doctors from the approved associations, as well as the staff of the regional health delegation are participating in this solidarity operation.  The operation was also organized with the support of local associations in Boumia, the Royal Gendarmerie, the Auxiliary Forces, local authorities, and the Ministry of Health.  The medical campaigns program was launched in 2003 to promote equal opportunities in access to basic health care for disadvantaged populations who do not have access to health facilities due to geographical remoteness and/or lack of social coverage. They also aim to provide care to as many people as possible. Since its launch in  2003, a total of 894 campaigns have been conducted, benefiting 1,066,608 people, added the statement. The cold weather caused the foundation to provide necessary aid to mountainous regions under royal instructions annually.  The foundation distributes aid, including blankets and foodstuffs, in mountainous areas where isolation and cold temperatures can pose problems.

Rabat – ITFC, which is a member of the Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDB), signed an agreement with Morocco to develop bilateral and regional cooperation. ITFC CEO Hani Salem and Morocco’s Secretary of State for the Ministry of Industry Rokia Eddarham signed the agreement during  the first meeting of the Governing Board of ITFC’s Arab Africa Trade Bridges (AATB) program in Rabat on November 1-2. The agreement aims to support trade infrastructure via a set of programs, including AATB, according to Saudi Gazette. The convention also seeks to facilitate funding and the development of international trade. Salem, according to the Saudi news outlet, said that the agreement will foster cooperation between ITFC and Morocco and will include several programs to enhance trade in the member countries.  He also emphasized Morocco’s role in the organization’s commitment to contribute to the development of Africa. Eddarham said that Morocco has been supporting AATB and “will continue to work together towards strengthening economic partnerships between Arab countries and African countries.” Eddarham said that the agreement, which supports Morocco’s strategy to increase trade between Morocco and other African countries, will reinforce this partnership. Launched in 2017 under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, the AATB program is a 3-year regional trade promotion program that was designed with the ultimate objective of leveraging new trade partnerships, strengthening existing ones, and increasing trade flows between the Arab and African regions, according to ITFC. The program also aims to develop trade and investment across the two regions.

The King said that he learned “with great sorrow and deep indignation the sad news of the heinous terrorist attack on a Coptic in the province of Minya,” an area located 245 kilometers south of Cairo. Subsequently, the King offered his condolences to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sissi.  The monarch also expressed Morocco’s solidarity with the Egyptian people and his support to combat terrorism, which he deemed “a scourge condemned by all the celestial religions and rejected by Islam.” The terror attack occurred on Friday, November 2, when gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying worshipers returning from a remote Coptic Christian monastery. International news outlets reported that 13 people were injured during the attack and 8 people were killed. The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed credit for the attack. The Egyptian President took to his Facebook to mourn the death of the victims on Friday. Sisi wrote: “I deeply grieve for the martyrs who fell [dead] today by treacherous hands that seek to undermine the cohesive fabric of the homeland.” He added that the incident will not “undermine the will of our nation to continue its battle for survival and construction.” Friday’s incident was not the first of its kind. In November 2017, at least 300 people were killed when gunmen attacked a mosque in northern Egyptian Sinai. The attack occurred in the village of Bir Al-Abed, located roughly 40 kilometers from El-Arich, the capital of the North Sinai province. The masked gunmen set off a suicide bomb before opening fire during the Friday prayer on the worshipers, many among whom were army conscripts. Egypt has witnessed several terror attacks since the dismissal of the elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 by the army. Besides ISIS, al-Qaeda-linked fighters operating from Libya were also active by the country’s western border.

The French official was speaking at the opening ceremony of Morocco-France business Forum, a cooperative investment-focused event between Paris and Rabat. The forum, which is being held in Laayoune, opened on November 2 and is set to close on November 4. Philipe-Edern-Kelin remarked on the rapid transformation of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region in recent years, calling it “an ideal hub” for business and investment ventures in Africa. The French businessman heaped praise on Morocco’s efforts to modernize the historically lagging-behind southern regions, noting improvement in living standards—especially progress in infrastructure—and investment prospects. Since proposing its Autonomy Plan in 2007, Morocco has laid the ground for massive development projects in southern territories. In Laayoune, Dakhla and Smara, Rabat has pledged over $7 billion to foster progress in infrastructure and employment prospects for locals. This year, Rabat reaffirmed its commitment to southern regions. According to government figures, Western Sahara won the lion’s share for the 2018 public investments funds. The government allocated more than 53 percent of the public investment funds to the Laayoune El Sakia Hamra region alone. Commenting on the structural transformations that Morocco’s investment efforts have led to in terms of infrastructure, employment and investment opportunities, the French official said that Morocco’s experience in southern territories should be a source of inspiration for other African countries when it comes to inclusive development strategies. “The region of the South benefits from ambitious investment programs, both public and private, and major infrastructure projects that make it the ideal hub to the African continent,” he said. He also called on Moroccan and French investors to accompany the Moroccan government’s initiative by engaging more with the region with regards to investments. “If we have chosen Laayoune to host, after Casablanca and Paris, this third edition of the Morocco-France business Forum, it is because we are convinced of the potential of the southern region, whose growth rate is one of the most dynamic in the Kingdom.” Philippe-Edern Klein finally announced a number of future projects for the southern region. The projects include the construction of a state-of-the-art industrial park with a land base of 40 hectares to be in El Marsa, a port city in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra. There are also projections of a modern college campus expected to host the French School of Business. Philippe-Edern Klein’s remarks come at a particularly critical time for Morocco’s legitimacy claims over the southern territories. The UN has been lately pushing for all parties to make concessions to reach an amicable and mutually accept, the Frenchman is not the first international figure to laud Morocco’s engagement in the southern provinces. At the Crans Montana forum held earlier this year in Dakhla, a host of international participants—including foreign officials and investors —acknowledged Morocco’s development efforts in the region. Renowned American priest and civil rights icon Jesse Jackson, for example, put Morocco on the pedestal of an Africa-inspired push for economic prosperity and inclusive growth. Reverend Jackson said that Morocco’s recent reforms—political and economic—should stand as an inspiration for other African countries. He called Morocco the “light-bearer for Africa,” noting that Rabat’s pronounced determination for increased South-South cooperation and intra-African exchanges can help bridge the widening development gulf between developed and developing countries.

Rabat – Speaking to the French outlet Le Monde following the UN resolution to extend the MINURSO mission in Western Sahara, Bourita spoke favorably of the international community’s newfound determination to commit all parties to the roundtable table. The Moroccan minister, however, stressed that Rabat will not yield to any decision that would challenge its integrity. “Some things are not negotiable for Morocco, namely any solution that would call into question the territorial integrity of the Kingdom or that would provide for a referendum option,” he said. Of the negotiations to be held in early December in Geneva, Bourita offered an optimist reading. He suggested changes in strategies and diplomatic momentum, saying that he expects the Geneva meeting to be different than the previous—and mostly unsuccessful—attempts to broker a settlement between Rabat and Algiers-backed Polisario. Algeria has long declined the status of full participants in the Western Sahara peace process. Horst Kohler, the UN special envoy for the Western Sahara dossier, has however convinced Algeria and Mauritania to join negotiations as stakeholders. Speaking of Kohler’s unprecedented success in convincing Algeria and Mauritania to come to Geneva without preconditions,” Bourita said that he expects more pragmatism and readiness to compromise from all participants. If the recently gained momentum is maintained, he explained, there will be less rhetoric and more steps towards conclusive actions to settle the decades-long diplomatic standoff in Western Sahara. Prior to the UN resolution earlier this week, there were reports of a fervent debate between France and the US about the duration of the MINURSO mandate. As penholder of the UN resolution on Western Sahara, Washington demanded that MINURSO’s mandate be extended by only six months, as opposed to the customary one-year extension. Washington’s move was motivated by a mounting desire to pressure all the conflicting parties into making necessary compromises, according to diplomatic sources. France, on the other hand, was for the traditional one-year extension. In contrast to Washington’s move towards immediacy and efficiency, Paris called for caution and effectiveness. France stressed that it was important that MINURSO be granted the necessary time-frame to uphold the cease-fire, which is a necessary prelude to any future hope of political settlement Asked whether Rabat had a particular take on the US-France divide on MINURSO, Bourita said that “the debate on the duration is a false debate.” What matters, he explained, is the effectiveness of the monitoring and the political process, rather than the time it takes. “It is not the duration that is important, but the political process that is independent of the peacekeeping operation.” In the same interview, Bourita also spoke of Morocco’s migration policy. While other countries—mainly in Europe—adopt a security approach towards migrants, Morocco has positioned itself as a true migrants-friendly country, the minster explained. “From the outset, Morocco’s migration policy has been based on three pillars: solidarity, responsibility and international cooperation. [Morocco] has its own migration policy and intends to be faithful to it. We believe that transit countries should not be at the heart of policy. All countries of origin, transit and destination should assume their responsibilities.”

Rabat- The documentary, which will premiere on November 17 at Rabat’s 23rd film festival at Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, may be just as its title suggests: A plea for the world to care for and not forget about its children with autism.  “Don’t Forget Me” depicts the challenges that Moroccan parents and their children with autism have to deal with in a society that is not yet equipped to handle autism. In 28 minutes, the documentary will showcase the different facets of autism and the discrimination children experience, denying them the right to receive education at school like their peers without disabilities. The short film, produced by American journalist Jackie Spinner and directed by Moroccan Rajae Bouardi, was inspired by Spinner’s two Moroccan-born adopted children with autism, 5-year-old Samir and 3-year-old Rafi. Souad Chelhani, whose twin boys are featured in the film, wanted to give her children a voice. “We are their voices. We must show our children that it is wrong for society to be cruel and refuse to include them. They have a human right to exist, to live without prejudice. They have the right to go to school, ” Chelhani said. “Don’t Forget Me” follows the story of three families and their children on the autism spectrum. The documentary takes the viewer into the homes and schools of the children. Momo, 11, goes to a public school with a classroom reserved for children with autism. But the classroom in the public school is not free. Momo’s education expenses weigh on his family, and the private association that runs the classroom “recruits families for the classroom based on their ability to pay.” The second family is that of 7-year-old Hamza who also goes to a public school. Hamza’s family pays for an aide or “shadow,” who accompanies him to school. Hamza has a twin brother, Taha, but because the family cannot afford two aides, Taha stays at home.  The third family is Othmane’s who goes to a private school on a scholarship. His family, like Hamza’s, pays for an aide who keeps him company at class. Othmane was born in the same hospital three days before Samir, Spinner’s son. Spinner adopted her sons from an orphanage in Meknes when they were infants. The boys now live in the US. In 2017, Spinner came back to Morocco to make the documentary. Columbia College Chicago and the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting provided the initial funding for the documentary through grants. Moroccan filmmaker Hakim Belabbes and Chicago director Michael Rabiger advised the project. “Don’t Forget Me” will feature in Arabic with English subtitles for US audiences and Tamazight (Berber) subtitles for a Moroccan audience.  Spinner touched on a spot-on truth in Morocco when it comes to autism. “It’s sad to see how hard the parents of the Moroccan boys in the film work to find opportunities that I take for granted, including the right my sons have in America to go to school,” she stated. Myths and misinformation surrounding autism are still prevalent in Morocco. The lack of understanding of the condition makes it hard for people with autism to become active members of Moroccan society. “People with autism are violent,” “People with autism are intellectually deranged,” “Children with autism are a result of bad parenting and can be cured.” The sentiments are some of the myths surrounding autism in Morocco, but perhaps the most dangerous of all is the belief that autism is, in itself, a myth. Autism, also called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a spectrum condition. As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), autism is “a range of conditions characterised by some degree of impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.” WHO estimates that 1 in 160 children worldwide have autism.  Morocco has no relevant official data for autism numbers.  Caring for children on the spectrum is demanding, especially those with severe autism. It is especially difficult when access to specialized healthcare services is inadequate. In Morocco, healthcare focused on autism is nearly non-existent. Parents face unbearable obstacles and are left to deal with their autistic children alone.  Children with autism, without early intervention, make it even harder for their parents and for them to benefit from the most basic rights. Morocco’s already ailing educational system, does not provide much scope for children to study freely. The children with autism sometimes find a small space in classrooms in public schools, like Hamza and Momo. The lack of research or medical training specialized in autism is one of the biggest issues causing misconceptions and lack of awareness about autism in Morocco. In contrast to people with autism being “violent,” as many perceive them to be, some children with autism are in fact the ones most vulnerable to violence. One video which went viral in 2016 shocked viewers across the internet, depicting abusive treatment towards people with autism. The video showed the president of the “Besma Association for Autistic People” beating his sister with autism in the Rabia al-Adawiyya school yard in Taroudant, near Agadir. Autism therapist Imane Haddouch had said then, “The president’s behavior is criminal and he should be punished for his actions. His punishment will serve as an example to others who commit similar crimes that they too will be punished for carrying out such acts on autistic children who are unable to talk about the abuse they face.” At the time, the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Education in Taroudant promised to deal with the offender severely.  Moroccans with autism can take hope and find support in the autism associations in Morocco, such as Collectif Autisme Maroc in Rabat or Association Sos Autisme of Casablanca. The associations aim to help families dealing with autism, no matter the obstacles.

Rabat – The 9-year-old prodigy Mariam Amjoun is “a source of pride for Morocco and for  the Moroccan schools,” the minister said Friday. Amjoun’s dedication to reading at the international contest of the “Challenge of Arabic reading” will allow Moroccans to “regain confidence in the education system,” said Amzazi. Amjoun returned to Morocco Friday from Abu Dhabi. The young bookworm won an MAD 1.3 million in prize money. She outperformed 10.5 million participants from 40 countries. Amzazi also hoped that the next reading contest will have other young Moroccan participants who will represent Morocco with dignity and honor, Maghreb Arab Press reported. During the ceremony, Amjoun said she was “very happy to win the prestigious Arabic reading contest.” She said her parents, both teachers, mainly deserve the merit award she received. King Mohammed VI also phoned Amjoun to congratulate her for winning the prize in Dubai. Amjoun said King Mohammed VI asked her about her “experience in the competition and the challenges” she faces in prestigious reading competitions. Despite her young age, Amjoun said that she has read 200 books and participated in the challenge with 60 books. She advised Arab children to read “because reading is the ‘lighthouse of civilization.’”  The Dubai  competition “is the largest-ever Arab literacy initiative encouraging students to read as many books as possible, over 50, in one academic year,” wrote Gulf News. The number of children participating this year increased by 26 percent since 2017, from 7.4 million to 10.5 million participants from 44 countries. Sheikh Mohammad launched the the Arab Reading Challenge in 2015. The challenge aims to “establish a culture of reading among the new Arab generations across the globe,” and enhance “the importance of knowledge in shaping their future as well as the future of their communities and countries.”

Rabat- A laureate from the Mohammadia School of Engineers in Rabat—where he was first in his class in 1982—and the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris, Mounir has been the BCP general director since October 2011.  He also assures the management of Upline Group and BP Shore Group, subsidies of BCP. Mounir started his professional career in 1982 as an engineer within the OCP Group. He led OCP’s information systems activities from 1987 to 1997.  Throughout his time there, Mounir played a central role in all the major development projects of OCP’s mining and industrial branches. He also contributed to major changes in OCP’s financial management and the upgrading of their human capital development policies. Mounir’s career within BCP began in 1997. He began to climb the leadership ladder, occupying various senior positions in information systems and risk management. Mounir was appointed to be general-director in 2011. Mounir has been very active alongside current economy minister Mohamed Benchaaboun to expand the BCP Group abroad and diversify its activities with specialized subsidiaries in para-banking and services. Mounir also founded and is president of the Association of Information Systems Users in Morocco (AUSIM).

Rabat- Foreign minister Nasser Bourita said in a meeting with the press on Thursday that the initiative is an “important step forward.” The hotline will allow Moroccans to track the processing of passports and other files. According to Bourita, the toll-free number will make Moroccans living abroad less dependent on visiting Moroccan consulates. Bourita added that the project is the result of four years of preparations. He expects that it will increase transparency and the “adoption of  unified criteria for transactions and administrative documents.” Bourita said that there will be a call center available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. providing services in seven languages. The languages will include “national dialects” and “other languages.” Morocco’s Minister Delegate in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad (MREs) Abdelkrim Benatiq noted in July that there are 5 million MREs. Benatiq’s ministry is working to implement programs to consolidate ties between MREs and Morocco. These programs, according to the official, are part of the national strategy to preserve the Moroccan identity of MREs. It is also designed to protect their rights and to promote interest in Morocco’s development. According to Benatiq, Moroccan expats “represent a model of coexistence and respect for each other’s beliefs.” In May, Morocco’s exchange regulator said that remittances from Moroccans living abroad hit $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018. The number represented an increase of 13.4 percent from the same period in 2017.

Rabat- The AP reported Friday that four Balkan countries have announced that they will make a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup. The heads of state from Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia made the announcement at a regional meeting on the Black Sea. Morocco announced it would submit another bid to host the World Cup immediately after the North African country lost its chance to host the 2026 World Cup to a North American joint bid in June. Moroccan officials have not yet revealed whether the country will submit a joint bid or another solo bid. Speculations ran wild this summer about a potential joint bid between Morocco, Spain, and Portugal. In September, however, Portuguese news outlet A Bola reported that Portugal is not planning to bid for the World Cup with Spain. “Morocco will bid to host the World Cup in 2030—there is no doubt about that. But we have not yet decided on the co-hosts. The decision will be politically discussed,” said Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) President Fouzi Lekjaa. After Morocco said it would bid to host the 2030 World Cup, Algeria and Tunisia expressed their interest in a joint Maghreb bid. A joint bid might increase Morocco’s chance to host the World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told the press after the end of the 2026 World Cup bidding process that he prefers joint bids. Several other countries have shown interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including England and a joint bid from South America: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. In August, Cameroonian presidential candidate Joshua Osih said that he would nominate his country along with two sub-Saharan African countries to jointly host the 2030 World Cup if he wins the presidential election. Osih, however,  was defeated by his competitor, incumbent Paul Biya, who was re-elected on October 22.

Rabat – Ozy Media, which earlier this year touted the North African country as “the new emerging African power,” would answer with a resounding “yes. But Ozy is not alone in this thinking. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also looks upon Morocco’s economic prospects favorably. Similarly, the World Bank hails Morocco as a promising market for doing business, despite minor, persistent structural and bureaucratic issues. In August, the World Bank Vice-President for the MENA region called Morocco “a bright spot in a dark region,” an allusion to what Moroccan policymakers call, somewhat boastfully, “Moroccan exceptionalism.” With all the fuss about Morocco’s diplomatic assertiveness in Africa, one element of Morocco’s successful African turn is often overlooked and unmentioned: soft power through scientific and cultural diplomacy. True, the country’s bold economic ventures in African markets, or even its Malikist cultural activism in Francophone and Muslim sub-Saharan Africa, have borne fruit in targeted parts of the continent. But when it comes to Morocco’s return to the African Union, the Morocco International Cooperation’s (AMCI) initiatives deserve the bulk of the credit, many AMCI scholars told Morocco World News. While Morocco is known to be the second-highest African investor in Africa, few would know that the North African country is also the leading African provider of scholarships to African students. As of December 2016, AMCI had agreements with 111 countries, of which 46 are African countries. AMCI’s uniquely assertive presence is most pronounced in Francophone Africa. Every year, AMCI provides thousands of scholarships for university and vocational degrees. Guinea, for example, sends over 100 of the top performers on the national exam to Moroccan institutions annually. For high-performing students without the means to attend a university in Canada, France, England, or the U.S., Morocco is a liberating prospect. “[It’s] a windfall,” said Youssouf Kourouma, an AMCI scholar, who has recently completed a master’s degree in international law at the University of Hassan II, Mohammedia. For thousands of low-income sub-Saharan students like Kourouma, “a well-earned Moroccan degree amounts to rosy career prospects.” When graduates of top Moroccan faculties return to their home countries, he explained, they usually land a well-paying job. Kourouma said that it was all worth it, as the five years he’s spent in Morocco have been enormously formative. “It has been a total paradigm shift,” he began. “In addition to the traditional academic components that the program entailed, I’ve learned a lot as a person.  The daily travails, the monthly hustle to make ends meet before AMCI’s bimonthly MAD 1500 stipend—all of it has made me more mature and intellectually equipped for my future career,” he said. Morocco’s involvement and influence expands to other fields like civil society and public administration. In a recent interview with a group of journalists during an AMCI-sponsored cultural event at its headquarter in Rabat, AMCI’s director general, Mohammed Methqal, expressed satisfaction with Morocco’s presence on the continent. In addition to the thousands of scholarships for young students, “Africa’s future leaders,” the AMCI program has accompanied and “contributed to the training of more than 5,000 public officials from 30 different countries,” Methqal said. Relying on a combination of human capital promotion, technical assistance, and support for sustainable development projects, AMCI is currently the sharpest weapon in Morocco’s diplomatic arsenal towards the rest of Africa. As Rabat attempts to charm both African markets and popular opinion, it has grown aware of the limits and defects of hard cash diplomacy. “While economic diplomacy can provide political clout in regional politics, scientific and cultural diplomacy allows you to influence people’s perception of you,” said Kourouma, adding that “AMCI scholarships have played an enormous role in how sub-Saharans view Morocco.” Aside from the knowledge acquired in Moroccan classrooms, international experiences with Moroccan teachers and classmates changes “many of the stereotypes we entertain about Moroccans and their outlook on the rest of Africa.” “So, I would say that beyond the usual heavy ‘African investor’ and ‘thriving economy’ headlines about Morocco, the true architect of Morocco’s successful continental turn is the commitment the country has shown for advancing education levels and technical expertise in other African countries,” Kourouma explained. Even as Morocco left the then Organization of African Unity (now African Union) in 1984, Kourouma elaborated, it maintained some degree of connection to the rest of the continent. AMCI was especially useful at that moment of de jure rupture with the continent. By keeping the quota of African students as high as possible, even after institutional breakup with the continent, Kourouma argued, AMCI proactively gave Morocco a chance at redemption. “It kept Morocco continuously present in Africa, even as it seemed to think that its future belonged elsewhere.” In June, Guinea was among the few African nations that chose the U.S.-led “United bid” over Morocco for the 2026 World Cup. Guinean authorities, who said there was a mistake during voting, were adamant about their “uncompromising support for Morocco.” On Guinean social media, meanwhile, there was a storm of frustration and anger. Why betray such a devout friend, a country that has always been there for Guinea, opening its doors to Guinean students and citizens even when many countries, including in Africa, ostracized Guinea when the Ebola epidemic erupted? Questions were asked, names were named, and fingers were pointed. The Guinean Football Federation issued a statement that sounded both apologetic and regretful, though they maintained their position that there had been a mistake. This seemingly trivial episode, Kourouma argued, showed how successive generations of Morocco-trained Guinean youth and elite have impacted the West African country’s opinion of the North African country. “My stay in Morocco has helped me to reinvent myself, broaden my prospects, and expand my social and intellectual horizons,” Elhadj Ibrahima Barry, a first-year Guinean student at the elite Mohammedia School of Engineering, told Morocco World News. Barry ranked third in Guinea’s Baccalaureate, the national university entrance exam, and he was given a scholarship to elite classes prépas(higher school preparatory classes) in Fez. There, he spent two years intensely studying advanced mathematics and physics, in preparation for a place at one of the top engineering schools in Morocco. Reminiscing on his prépasyears, he said: “The teaching quality was incredible. I would definitely recommend Morocco as [study] destination.” Barry beams with smiles and laudatory remarks when he speaks of his prépas atmosphere, especially his “genius Moroccan classmates.” “There was so much sociability and hospitality,” he said. “Beyond the easy stereotypes I had been exposed to prior to coming here, I’ve discovered a predominantly welcoming and warm atmosphere at school.” “I am happy to have come here,” says Boubacar, an economics student in Tangiers. Boubacar, who is even more enthusiastic than Barry, seems more than happy. His elated tone speaks more of love than happiness; he has fallen in love with Morocco, at least that is what one gets from his incessant praise of the “education Morocco has given me.” “Morocco has one of the best education systems in the world,” he offered. “So being at a Moroccan school has been largely good for my intellectual and personal growth. Morocco has given me hope, and I am now confident in fighting for my dreams. Thank you so much, Morocco!”  While AMCI’s achievements between 1986 and 2016 can be lauded, the true turning point came with King Mohammed VI’s sincere interest in African issues. Starting in 1999, Mohammed VI crisscrossed the continent, as he tried—and many times successfully—to sell Morocco’s vision of an “Africa that believes in its potential.”  According to the latest AMCI figures, the King’s personal commitment to Africa has led to a revamping of Morocco’s Africa-focused programs. In 2017 to 2018 alone, Morocco granted over 5,000 scholarships to African students, almost a third of the total number of African students that Morocco hosted up to 2016-2017. The same period also marked a stupendous increase of African students receiving the AMCI stipend, from 6,500 students in 2017 to over 11,000 to this day, Methqal explained. He noted that “the royal vision for prioritizing South-South and intra-African initiatives” has been a determining factor in doubling Morocco’s engagement for sustainable development in the continent. Others see the King’s “personal engagement” through a combative lens. It has been, they argue, the coup de forcein Morocco’s silent rejoinder to its African detractors. “Whenever anyone questions Morocco’s commitment to Africa or defies Morocco about storming out of the continental union, the kingdom can calmly present AMCI’s achievements and King Mohammed VI’s personal investment in sub-Saharan Africa. It shows that they never really left Africa,” said a Malian doctoral student who requested anonymity. He added, referring to the sea change that Mohammed VI’s Africa-focused rhetoric has brought to Moroccan society: “People who feared me in 2009, or sometimes threatened me, now approach me with smiles. They even call me ‘my African brother.’ To say that that is progress is an understatement,”

The measure is due to the large numbers of migrants arriving in Morocco and wishing to complete an undocumented journey to Europe. The Moroccan foreign ministry will now require all African travelers, except Tunisians and Algerians, to fill out an online form on the ministry’s website to get a permit, Reuters wrote. The measure will impact countries that currently have visa-free access to Morocco: Mali, Niger, Senegal, Guinea, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Côte d’Ivoire. According to a documentReuters saw from the Moroccan embassy in Mali, the move aims to help Moroccan authorities identify incoming travelers and “facilitate passenger traffic.” According to a document issued by Royal Air Maroc, the new regulation came into force Thursday, November 1, for citizens of Congo, Guinea, and Mali. Morocco may be adopting the move as an alternative to the European Union’s proposal to build reception centers in Morocco to process migrants’ asylum applications. Morocco has rejected the proposal. An estimated 40,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean from Morocco since January.

Rabat- Rabat, too has had its share of floods and traffic disruption. Photos and videos of the two cities, especially from Casablanca’s Ain Diab neighborhood, have been circulating on social media. On Tuesday, the floods impeded traffic in the center of Casablanca and stopped the city’s trams from operating from afternoon to night. Moroccans took to social media to share videos of flooded streets, complaining about the overflowing streets and “poor infrastructure.” The Casablanca-Settat region and many others across the country are experiencing a cold snap and rainfalls early in the season.  Since Sunday, October 28, temperatures dropped drastically in Morocco, leading to the first snowfall of 30 centimeters in the Atlas Mountain cities of Ifrane and Midelt and the villages of Imouzzer, El Hajeb, and Boulemane.  Severe floods hit several regions of Morocco in late September in Rhamna and Al Haouz, Sidi Ifni, Meknes, and Guelmim, causing up to five deaths. The floods also caused extensive property damage and agricultural casualties, from flooded houses to drowned livestock and blocked roads. In the past year, the Moroccan National Motorway Company (ADM) has carried out several investment projects worth a total of MAD 600 million. The projects mainly tried to modernize infrastructure and electronic tolls. In April, the company pledged a MAD 3.4 billion investment to widen the Casablanca-Berrechid road and other future projects.

Rabat – The decision follows the Confederation of African Football (CAF) executive committee’s approval of using VAR at its meeting September 27-28 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.  The move comes after the latest  refereeing technology was used successfully during the CAF Super Cup in February in Casablanca between Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) and Congo’s TP Mazembe. For the first time VAR will be used in the CAF Champions League final. VAR was used in the first phase of the Champions League final between the Egyptian club, Al Ahly, and Tunisia’s Es Tunis. The teams played in Egypt at Borg El Arab stadium in Cairo yesterday. Al Ahly took home the victory 3-1, scoring two goals on VAR-awarded penalties. VAR was first widely used in the football world during the 2018 Russia World Cup. FIFA considered it “largely successful.” “We used it for the Super Cup last February without any hitches and are delighted to go a step further,” CAF general secretary Amr Fahmy said. “This is another historic moment for African football. CAF is determined to use the latest innovative technologies available,” Fahmy added.

Mauritania’s president, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz received Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, on Friday, in Nouakchott. Bourita was carrying a personal message from King Mohammed VI. In a statement to the press at the end of the meeting, Bourita said that he had “the honor to be received by the President of the Republic as an envoy of King Mohammed VI, carrying a message from His Majesty to His Excellency the President concerning the bilateral relations and the regional situation.” Bourita, who is on a one-day visit to Mauritania, added that the two heads of state have a “common desire to push these relations to the level they deserve, given the strong ties between the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.” In this regard, he highlighted the common will shown by King Mohammed VI and Mauritanian president of the Republic to promote these relations and raise them to the expected level, given the strong ties between the two countries. He also noted that “significant changes will take place in the future as part of the dynamic sought by the King and the president of the Republic”. Bourita said that, at the audience, “the Mauritanian president presented the situation in the region, based on his experience and the leading role Mauritania plays in the region.” The visit comes in the wake of the adoption by the Security Council of Resolution 2440 on Western Sahara on Wednesday.  The resolutions welcomes  that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively” to participate in the Geneva round-table on 5-6 december, and “encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.”

By Trista Youssef Rabat- The eight countries are all major buyers of Iranian oil. China and Turkey, both large importers of Iranian oil, also sought sanction waivers from the US. A full list of countries receiving waivers is expected to be officially released on Monday when the US renews its sanctions on Tehran. Although Trump’s policy is to limit Iran’s oil revenue, the recent waivers on sanctions aim to prevent spikes in oil prices.  State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told US reporters, “We are determined to implement our policy of maximum pressure on Iran. That’s our strategy.” He continued, “But we are prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case by case basis.” In May, the Trump administration warned importers of Iranian oil to halt all trade with Iran by November 4. Countries continuing to import Iranian oil following the US’s reimposition of sanctions face the risk of economic exclusion from the US market.  Iran’s deputy oil minister, Ali Kardor, responded to the US’s political move, stating, “The waivers granted to these eight countries shows that the market needs Iran’s oil and it cannot be pulled out of the market … I don’t know whether these waivers are permanent or temporary ones.” So far, the US has managed to reduce Iranian oil exports from 2.7 to 1.6 million barrels per month through sanctions, according to internal US estimates.

Rabat – Last week, just two days before Morocco was set to end Daylight Saving Time (GMT+1), the government announced it would be staying on GMT+1 year-round.  The move prompted mass confusion from Moroccans who woke up Sunday wondering just exactly what time it was. Many blamed cell phone carriers for not adjusting to the new decree and making an erroneous time change.  Cell service provider Inwi told Morocco World News that the company “is not responsible for changing the clock time. This is a problem coming from the phones which are programmed automatically.” The government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 last Friday, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in Morocco year-round. Critics said the government announced the change with little prior warning, failing to give mobile systems enough time to adapt.

The de facto Saudi leader’s alleged comment came during a phone call with President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and US National Security Advisor John Bolton on October 9. Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist who was harshly critical of the Saudi crown prince, disappeared on October 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. Since news emerged of his brutal murder, many in the international community have celebrated the journalist as a freedom fighter and a needed voice of resilience and subversion against Saudi Arabia’s state apparatus. A late-October New York Times report linked Khashoggi’s murder to his unapologetic criticism of the regime in his native Saudi Arabia. Delegitimizing Khashoggi Days before his death at the hands of Saudi security officials, Khashoggi was preparing to show the world evidence of MBS’s “darker side,” the Times noted. MBS, meanwhile, thought of the critical journalist as a “dangerous Islamist” rather than a fighter for freedom and democracy, according to the Washington Post, where Khashoggi was a contributing writer. In the alleged phone call, the crown prince reportedly told his US interlocutors that Khashoggi was part of the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Sunni organization that some Western governments, including some in the US, consider a proponent of a radical and violent version of Islam. Tom Wilson, a terrorism and radicalization specialist at the UK-based Henry Jackson Society think tank, seems to agree with some of MBS’s assessment. He said last week that the truth in the Khashoggi murder is “much more complicated” and that the fervor that followed news of his disappearance “covers up more than it reveals.” “As an insider to the Saudi regime, Khashoggi had also been close to the former head of the intelligence agency. He was an Islamist, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and someone who befriended Osama Bin Laden and had been sympathetic to his Jihad in Afghanistan,” Wilson said. But the narrative has been unsuccessful so far. Many see it as an attempt to delegitimize Khashoggi to make his murder more palatable in the West. (Washington and the West’s abhorrence of Islamist radicalism is an open secret.) What the Khashoggi family says Khashoggi’s family has been quick to respond. The slain journalist’s family issued a statement that vehemently denied he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Washington Post quoted his family as saying: “Jamal Khashoggi was not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He denied such claims repeatedly over the past several years. Jamal Khashoggi was not a dangerous person in any way possible. To claim otherwise would be ridiculous.” The reported phone call came a week into Khashoggi’s mysterious disappearance. At the time, Saudi Arabia denied any wrongdoing in the case. Riyadh said that Khashoggi had left the consulate as soon as his errand had been completed. International pressure and unrelenting leaks of damning evidence by Turkish news outlets led Riyadh to repeatedly alter its original narrative. Saudi Arabia’s latest position is that Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated operation inside the Saudi consulate. The kingdom is nonetheless adamant about MBS’s innoncence. It has called the murder “a rogue operation” and has since sacked and arrested dozens of senior officials. Meanwhile, the post-Kahshoggi backlash continues to paint Riyadh and MBS in a negative light. Many voices have demanded that the journalist’s murderers be brought to account.
Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s Turkish fiancée, maintained in a recent editorial, “The international community must bring my fiancé’s killers to justice.”

“The government will issue the study adopted to stay on Daylight Saving Time next week for the public,” El Khalfi said in a press conference after the weekly government council Thursday, November 1. The decision to move Moroccan standard time from GMT to GMT+1 year-round was “a sovereign decision,” El Khalfi affirmed. The government spokesperson admitted that there were delays in making the decision.
The decision to stay on DST angered many Moroccan people who raised questions about the alleged study. They also called on the government to publish the ‘gate in charge of administration reform, Mohamed Benabdelkader, the government’s decision to stay on GMT+1 year-round was based on “an evaluation study.” Benabdelkader explained that the study’s indicators included “health aspects related to time change, energy saving and Morocco’s commercial transactions.”
The study’s results confirmed that “adopting double timing creates some confusion” among the public, he added. Despite moving to GMT+1 year-round, Morocco temporarily will return to GMT for the month of Ramadan when the holy month falls in the summer. In an interview with Morocco World News, MP Abdellatif Ouahbi called on the government to reveal the study that the government claimed to have conducted on time change.
Ouahbi, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), said that Moroccan television channels and officials reported that the decision was based on surveys and reports conducted by the government. “I want to see these reports,” he stressed. “No problem, show us the report so we can read them. If you can convince us with your reports, then everything will be good,” Ouahbi told MWN. According to Telquel Arabi, Benabdelkader said that the study started in May, and the government received the study’s preliminary results on October 9. A Telquel source said the study was conducted under the supervision of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Benabdelkader claimed that the research aimed to study the reactions of Moroccans to time changes. But then he said, “The study did not include direct questions about the preferences of Moroccans,” according to Telquel Arabi. However, Benabdelkader also asserted, “We found that 68 percent of them prefer stability. The decision to maintain daylight saving time is a political decision.” Benabdelkader’s claims seem contradictory, saying that the study did not include direct questions to citizens and at the same time the study shows “68 percent” of Moroccans “prefer stability.”

Rabat- Belarbi, who studies at a public primary school in Morocco’s port city of Essaouira, ranked first among seven Moroccan children who also won awards in the same competition. Children from 30 countries competed for prizes October 27-28. The competition asks contestants to solve 170 problems in 7 minutes. Belarbi solved 160 problems in 7 minutes, the highest score in the competition. In an interview with the press, the young girl expressed her joy upon receiving the award. “I am very happy that I reached this level, and it’s all thanks to my teacher Youness,” she said with a smile. “I advise children to believe in themselves, and advise parents to encourage and support their children to accomplish their goals,” she told news outlet Soltana. Commenting on 9-year-old Moroccan Mariam Amjoun’s winning of the UAE’s Arab Reading Challenge this week, Belarbi said: “You did very well and you were confident, may God protect you.”   The Moroccan winners at the arithmetic competition were: Belarbi, who won first place in “Level 1” of the competition; Adam El Hawas, a middle school student who won first place in “Level 4;” and Kenza Ghounimi, a highschooler who took second place in “Level 4.” The other four Moroccan contestants, all from Essaouira, also scored high in the competition and received awards.  Mariam Amjoun won the 2018 Arab Reading Challenge in Dubai, outperforming 10.5 million participants from 40 countries. Amjoun won AED 500,000 (nearly MAD 1.3 million) in prize money. She will use it for her university education and for her family for encouraging her to read, reported Gulf News. The award ceremony was held at the Dubai Opera House today, October 30. Amjoun has read 200 books despite her young age.  Amjoun and Belarbi have become the “pride” of Morocco.  In a phone call, King Mohammed VI congratulated Amjoun upon her winning. Amjoun said in a video that he asked her about her “experience in the competition and the challenges.”

By Josh Babb Rabat – Bolsonaro made the remarks on Thursday If the move does happen, Brazil would join just two other countries, the US and Guatemala, in stationing their embassy in the contested city of Jerusalem.  Taking to Twitter, Bolsonaro said, “As previously stated during our campaign, we intend to transfer the Brazilian Embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel is a sovereign state and we shall duly respect that.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to praise Bolsonaro “for his intention to move the Brazilian Embassy to Jerusalem, a historic, correct and exciting step!” The Palestinians lay claim to parts of East Jerusalem which Israel has controlled since the 1967 six-day war. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its rightful capital. Most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.  Rubens Barbosa, Brazil’s former ambassador to the US, says the move could endanger Brazil’s economic ties with Arab countries, stating the country risks “throwing away as much as $6 billion per year in poultry sales.” On Sunday, congressman Bolsonaro won a runoff election in Brazil against leftist candidate ex-Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, claiming 55 percent of the vote in a country where election participation is compulsory. The runup to Sunday’s election was marred by harsh rhetoric and political violence targeted at voters, journalists, and politicians. Bolsonaro himself was stabbed in the stomach at a rally in September.   Bolsonaro has a controversial history, often making crude comments targeting Brazil’s minorities, the LGBT community, and women. He once told a fellow congresswoman that she did not deserve to be raped because she was “very ugly.” He also publicly stated that he would rather see his son “die in an accident” than come out as homosexual.

Rabat – Since August, Moroccan and international news outlets have been reporting on a possible visit from  Macron to Morocco. The French president is set to chair the launching of Morocco’s LGV first high-speed train. Quoting an anonymous source, Moroccan news outlet Hespress reported that Macron might also visit Morocco again in early 2019. Morocco’s high-speed train project entered the pre-operation phase in June, and the project was set to be complete towards the end of the year.  During his visit to Morocco, Macron is also expected to discuss a range of common interests with King Mohammed VI. Hespress’ source denied any tension between France and Morocco, because of the postponement of the visit of French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Morocco. According to the source, the postponement was due to Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita accompanying King Mohammed VI to the UAE at the time. In September, Moroccan media reported that Le Drian would visit Morocco on September 10. However, Le Drian and Bourita did not meet until Wednesday in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, west of Paris. During the meeting, Le Drian pointed out Morocco’s role in combating terror threats posed by returning fighters from Syrian-Iraqi conflict zones. He said that the Moroccan-French security cooperation “is essential to respond to the threat posed by the return of foreign fighters from the Syrian-Iraqi” conflict zones.  In June, the two countries joined Belgium and Spain in creating a joint anti-terror front to “materialize,” “upgrade,” and “harmonize” their efforts regarding intelligence, field interventions, and deradicalization. The two officials also discussed efforts to tackle migratory pressures in both countries. Le Drian said that Morocco and France must respond to the issue in “a spirit of firmness, responsibility and humanity.” An important ally to Morocco, France remains the foremost foreign investor to its African counterpart. There has recently been a marked increase in Morocco’s exports to France, rising by 20 percent in 2016 alone, according to the French government.

By Mohamed Hikal The new agreement between the Souss Massa region and RAM took effect November 1 and will remain in effect for two years. “For passengers flying between Agadir and Casablanca, an economy class ticket will cost MAD 550 and a business class ticket will be MAD 1,100 with an average of 5 to 6 flights back and forth per day,” Souss Massa region President Abdellah Oubari said. The low-cost Air Arabia has introduced a cheaper flight linking Agadir to Casablanca with prices starting from MAD 250. The Souss Massa Regional Council will subsidize Morocco’s flag carrier at approximately MAD 46 million per year. RAM will also receive a MAD 10 million subsidy from the General Directorate of Civil Aviation. The agreement will increase the number of flights between Agadir’s Massira Airport and Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport. “This agreement has economic, tourist, and social implications. It will enhance mobility between Agadir and Casablanca and encourage tourism and investments in the region,” Oubari added. Previously, RAM tickets cost MAD 7,000 or more. However, because Air Arabia has already offered even cheaper flights, it would seem that RAM’s subsidized tickets will only benefit a wealthier class who wants better service than flying with Air Arabia or traveling by bus. In the absence of railway line linking Agadir to Casablanca, locals in the Souss Massa region can only go north in Supratour buses, which are annexed to the ONCF railway company, or CTM buses. Supratour bus tickets cost MAD 205 to 210. CTM buses, the Moroccan Transport Company, offer tickets for MAD 215 to 225. There are other buses that might cost a little less than these two. Adding RAM’s cheaper air travel tickets will help Agadir and the region as a whole to be more accessible to the country and may end its stagnation. But with the high cost of the subsidies, it remains to be seen if the move will pay for itself and become sustainable.

The Russian fighter’s October 6 victory over Conor McGregor in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 229 made headlines globally. Afterwards, several heads of state have warmly congratulated Nurmagomedov in person, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Diab Bin Zayed Al Nahyan In an interview with TMZ Sports on Wednesday, Abdelaziz stated that Khabib will “probably meet King Mohammed VI next week.” The manager mentioned the possibility of a rematch with McGregor in exchange for a large sum of money. “Maybe for a whole bunch of money … maybe we give a rematch to the guy that was just killed.” He added that Nurmagomedov has plans in Africa to help people and fund the digging of wells and school building. Abdelaziz requested at least $50 million to get Nurmagomedov into a cage or boxing ring. Because the UFC 229 fight was held in Las Vegas, the Nevada Athletic Commission suspended Nurmagomedov and has withheld his $2 million UFC 229 prize pending a full investigation into a post-match incident between Nurmagomedov and McGregor. After the match, Nurmagomedov jumped into McGregor’s team’s area and started fighting them. He said he was reacting to McGregor’s insults of Nurmagomedov’s Muslim religion and family at press meetings before the match. Nurmagomedov’s future with the UFC is uncertain. The organization withdrew Nurmagomedov’s training partner, Zubaira Tukhukov, from a match with McGregor’s training partner, Artem Lobov. The fight was scheduled for late October, but Tukhukov was involved in the Las Vegas fight and even punched McGregor, according to MMAFighting. Nurmagomedov has denounced the UFC’s decision and threatened to leave the organization. Will a Nurmagomedov-Mayweather boxing match happen? A few days after Nurmagomedov’s victory over McGregor, the Russian fighter called out the undefeated American boxer, Floyd Mayweather, to a boxing match. There has not been an official statement that the match will take place. However, UFC President Dana White insisted on a match under mixed martial arts rules, not another boxing match like the one between Mayweather and McGregor last year. “We went over there, we boxed him and if he wants to do it again, he’s gotta come fight in the UFC,” White said to ESPN. “I don’t think it’s very realistic at all but I didn’t think the boxing match was either and it happened so we’ll see,” he added.

By Safaa El Halouti Rabat – After the end of the ideological war between communism and liberalism, democracy became the successful model of governance, state organization, and economic development. Not only did it present a political formula for the modern state, it also offered an order that regulated international relations post-World War II. Democracy has gained supremacy for decades with waves of democratization taking place all over the world. While the Middle East was not able to be part of this democratization process, the 2011 Arab Spring came as a shock, delivering the message that the Arab people care about democracy and do want it as their system of governance. Clinton spoke of the “habit” aspect of democracy because the US is in the midst of campaigns for midterm elections November 6. Democrats especially are trying to encourage voters to vote by getting them out of a desperate and hopeless mood. The majority of people affiliated to the Democratic party and sympathizers have despaired since the election of Donald Trump. Democrats risk losing midterm elections—and maybe another presidential election—if they continue in the state of hopelessness. Calling “democracy” a habit that needs to be practiced again and again, Clinton calls for people not to abandon the process. Just because one particular election brought about results Democrats did not expect, does not mean they should abandon democracy. The state of hopelessness on the left regarding the democratic model is not exclusive to the United States. And as a model of democratic rule, what happens in the United States greatly affects the international order. The right wing has recently gained territory in many countries, some of which were in the habit of “democratic consolidation.” Of course, democracy is not only about votes and elections. Although elections are an important part, they are only one level out of many others. The system of liberal values upon which democracy and democratic rule stands is the foundational reference behind the strength and endurance of the democratic model in the West. That is why the left wing worries about the rise of the far right, generally, and of the Trump administration, specifically. Although the right wing was brought to office by the democratic practice of free and fair elections, I do not believe they share the liberal values at the foundation of democratic practices. At other times, the right presents and executes policy orientations against democratic and liberal practices. When Clinton calls democracy a “habit,” she emphasizes the need for the practice to keep rotating because it has within itself the mechanics to survive and overturn results she perceives as counterproductive. Democracy, as a form of government, does not necessarily elect the best and fittest; it elects whoever will not be contended by other parties. That is why the mechanism has within itself the option to choose candidates to positions of power, give them time to execute their policies, and then retests them in another election round. Incumbents either get another confidence vote or are removed and replaced.  From this perspective, it is vital not only to maintain the habit, but to make sure that the process itself serves its purposes. Considering that democracy does not elect the fittest, voting act as a civic duty “fixes the bugs” of the democratic system. Democrats are campaigning hard now in the United States to win the upcoming midterms. It seems that their number one talking point is that the political power needs to be reversed and the president needs to be impeached because he does not represent what democracy is about, what the American people are about, or the founding idea of the United States. How is this similar to what Morocco is currently experiencing as a country whose democratic history is very “fragile” and “recent.” Over half a century since independence, some important liberal practices have taken root: A multiparty system, a regime with strong popular legitimacy, and the equity and reconciliation commission. Yet, Morocco can only trace the first transparent elections to 2011, after constitutional reforms came as an answer to the Arab Spring. Seven years later, Moroccans are again losing confidence in political institutions, in the elite they elected, and in the process as a whole.  Reforms have proved to be harder to implement than anticipated. After all, you cannot transform overnight a state system that has been in place for over 50 years. Corruption, coercion, lack of enthusiasm for not-necessarily-popular “severe” reforms, and, of course, the efforts of the previously privileged are causes of failure. In the eyes of the people, the first and second freely elected governments are not operating as transformative forces and solving education, health, and employment problems. It is not that the government is not implementing its governmental agenda with guidance from King Mohammed VI and focusing on those three important social aspects. It is just not enough for those who have put so much hope in the electoral process and dangerously started believing that the whole process is in vain. When Clinton said that democracy is a habit that needs to be practiced over and over again, she is referring to the established democracy back in her country, in a way to urge her side not to give up and to go vote in the elections November 6. While democracy is not a habit in Morocco, it is a process. It too, needs to be practiced over and over again because it has within itself the mechanism to solve political problems civilly. The challenge today for the left wing in the United States is to vote massively so that the Democrats can get power over both houses of Congress. In Morocco, the challenge is to not give up on the process of consolidation. Massive political engagement is needed so that the elite can somewhat “comfortably” introduce policy and make the laws. But it is also needed to reach a stage of democratic consolidation. Whether as a habit or a process, there is no alternative to Moroccans being able to choose who gets to decide on their lives.

By Trista Youssef Rabat- The Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah has insisted on representation of its Sunni allies in Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri’s cabinet. Hariri, a Sunni himself, has refused to include a Hezbollah-allied Sunni opposition member in his six-member Cabinet and threatened his political counterparts to “look for a person other than me to form a government.” The recent disagreement reflects an ongoing power struggle within the Lebanese government. In the May 6 parliamentary elections, Hezbollah and its political allies won more than 70 of 128 seats. The Lebanese government will delay its formation until internal agreement on sectarian representation is reached.  Early in October, Hariri told reporters, “I’m willing to give everyone seats from my share for the sake of the country.” However, recent demands from Hezbollah and its Sunni allies seem to have challenged the prime minister’s limits.  Mustafa Alloush, a leading figure in Prime Minister Hariri’s Sunni Future Movement, said he does not “understand the external reason why Hezbollah is obstructing the formation of the government in these regional circumstances.” Alloush stressed that Hariri “will not accept to give his ministerial quota to the Sunni opposition.”  Hezbollah’s growing influence poses a challenge for anti-Hezbollah political figures regarding parliamentary power and representation.  Lebanese President Michel Aoun addressed the demands of Hezbollah and its Sunni allies as problematic, stating: “This matter caused the delay, and this delay is a type of political tactic that is hurting our big strategy.”   Political division stunting Lebanon from forming a functioning government raises concerns for Lebanon’s highly-indebted economy. The country is in dire need of economic reform, as it holds the world’s third largest public debt proportional to its economic output.

Rabat – On Thursday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita commented on the resolution in Rabat. The first point that Morocco considers as a “diplomatic achievement” in the latest resolution was the Security Council’s decision to pave the way towards including Algeria as part of the UN-led political process. On Wednesday, the resolution called on all parties, both the neighboring and main parties to the conflict, to “work constructively| to find a solution to the 42-year-old conflict over the region. According to Bourita, the resolution has preserved Morocco’s achievements from previous resolutions: the pre-eminence of the Moroccan autonomy initiative, the serious and credible nature of Morocco’s efforts, and the call for the registration of refugees. In September, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, invited Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front to participate in round-table talks. Algeria, however, has long claimed it is an observer and not a party to the conflict, as opposed to Morocco and Polisario. On Wednesday, the resolution noted that it “expresses its full support for the intention of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy to initiate a renewed negotiations process before the end of 2018; notes that invitations to an initial roundtable meeting in Geneva on 5 and 6 December 2018 were sent on 28 September 2018, welcomes that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively, and encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” In the paragraph, the Security Council used language that, according to analysts, carries significant political weight because it mentions Algeria and Mauritania on equal footing with Morocco and Polisario.  Despite the resolution’s invitation to Algeria to show commitment and willingness to contribute to the UN-led political process, Bouteflika’s regime still believes that the conflict should be solved between Morocco and Polisario only. On Thursday, Algeria issued a statement saying it took note of the new resolution.Repeating its traditional line, Algeria said that the Security Council “again calls upon the two parties to the conflict, which it has clearly identified, namely Morocco and the Polisario Front, to resume direct negotiations without preconditions and in good faith.” In response, Bourita said that the resolution encourages the participants in the round-table meeting, , to “participate without preconditions and in good faith.” He added that the resolution shows a “significant evolution in the process.” He also said that Algeria is “indeed, urged to fully commit itself throughout the process, in accordance with its political, historical and legal responsibility in the dispute.” The Moroccan government also approves the Security Council’s position on the region’s status quo. Bourita recalled that the resolution included two new paragraphs calling Polisario out. The Polisario Front has long claimed Bir Lahlou and Tifariti as “liberated zones.” However, the resolution dismissed Polisario’s claims, calling on the front to “fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat,” reads the second part of operative paragraph 6 of the resolution. Resolution 2440 also invites the parties to “respect their relevant obligations and assurances, and refrain from any actions that could undermine UN-facilitated negotiations or further destabilize the situation in the Western Sahara.”

Rabat – On Thursday, AFP reported that the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in response to the Security Council’s Resolution 2440 on Western Sahara, adopted Wednesday. The resolution has, for the first time, included Algeria, calling on the country to “work constructively” with the personal envoy for Western Sahara to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. Algeria says in its statement that it “took note” of the Security Council resolution renewing MINURSO’s mandate for six months. In an attempt to deny responsibility in the conflict, Algeria’s ministry wrote that the Security Council “again calls upon the two parties to the conflict, which it has clearly identified, namely Morocco and the Polisario Front, to resume direct negotiations without preconditions and in good faith.” Algeria’s statement, however, ignored the resolution paragraph calls on Algeria to show commitment to the UN-led political process. The resolution also expects all parties—the main and neighboring countries to the conflict—to come to round-table talks in Geneva December 5-6. The round-table was an initiative proposed by the UN Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler. Resolution 2440 mentioned Kohler’s invitations, saying that it “notes that invitations to an initial roundtable meeting in Geneva on 5 and 6 December 2018 were sent on 28 September 2018, welcomes that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively, and encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” Although Algeria accepted Kohler’s invitation, the country considers itself an “observer party.” In its statement, Algeria further reiterated that it “remains convinced that only a direct, frank and fair negotiation between Morocco and the Polisario is likely to lead to a definitive solution.” The statement backs similar positions voiced by Algerian officials, including Algeria’s Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia. Morocco, however, firmly believes Algeria plays an important role in continuing the conflict.

Rabat- Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced the latest appointment signaling his continued push for more female representation in the country’s top leadership  positions.  Just last week, Ethiopia swore in the country’s first female president, Sahle-Work Zewde. Meaza previously served as a high court judge in Ethiopia, going on to found the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association. She was also an advisor on gender and women’s rights at the UN Economic Commission for Africa.  Abiy Ahmed’s chief of staff praised Meaza’s appointment, saying, “She brings a track record of competence and relevant experience to the role.” Meaza’s name gained international notoriety for a 1996 court case which was later turned into the movie “Difret” written and directed by Zeresenay Mehari and produced by Angelina Jolie.  Difret tells the true story of Aberash Bekele who, in 1996, at the age of 14, was kidnapped as she returned from school by a man who intended to marry her. In an attempt to escape her captor, Aberash shot and killed him, leading her to be charged with murder.  Meaza represented the girl in court pro bono and succeeded in getting the charges dropped. The trial set off a debate in Ethiopia regarding the tradition of kidnapping for marriage.  In presenting her nomination, Ahmed said Meaza had the background needed to improve the court’s implementation of reforms and justice in the country. Ethiopia’s Parliament approved her nomination unanimously.

Rabat – The new schedule is the second the ministry released in one week, replacing a plan from Saturday, October 27. Schools will now start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1 and 3 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  The time-table concerns schools with one teacher per classroom, the ministry said in a statement. For schools with two teachers per classroom, one group of students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3:30 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.  The other group will start at 11:30 a.m. and end at 5:30 p.m. with a two-hour lunch break between 1:30 and 3.30 p.m.  The two groups will go to school on Saturday as well. With the new time-table, some classes will have school for only two hours in the afternoon while others will have only 4 or 4.5 hours of school total per day. The reduction in hours may confuse school administrators and teachers, as they will have to change their planned classes to adjust to the new time-table. For schools in rural areas, students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 3 p.m. with a 30-minute lunch break from Monday to Friday. For rural schools having two teachers per classroom, one group of students will start at 9 a.m. and end at 1:30 p.m. while the other group will start at 1:30 p.m. and end at 6 p.m. The two groups will go to school on Saturday, too. Middle and high school will start at 9 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. with two options for their two-hour lunch: between 12 noon and 2 p.m or between 1 and 3 p.m. The schedule, reduced by one hour from the typical time-table, may require teachers to cut some  subjects or topics from the curriculum. The new time will be effective beginning Monday, November 12. Children return to school on Wednesday, November 7, after the fall break. The October 27 time-table stipulated that it goes into effect on November 7, so children may need to follow it for half a week before the newer time-table takes effect. The October 27 time-table allowed only one hour for lunch break. The decision angered parents because one hour would not be enough for their children to go home for lunch. Schools will go back to the traditional time-table in spring. Public schools usually open at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. with a 2 hour-lunch break from 12 noon to 2 p.m. The time-table change comes after the government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855 Friday, to stay on Daylight Saving Time (DST) year-round, changing Morocco’s standard time from GMT to GMT+1. Without changing the time-table, children would have had to go to school shortly after sunrise.

Rabat – The meeting is part of the King’s regular follow-up of the implementation of the renewable energy strategy, said a statement by the Royal Cabinet.

This year, the objectives that the King set in April were achieved within the deadlines, Maghreb Arab Press reported. The objectives included beginning the operation of Noor Ouarzazate, a 580 megawatt solar energy complex. The Noor Ouarzazate III tower was successfully synchronized to the power grid, making it one of the largest solar multi-technology complexes in the world, according to the Royal Cabinet. Engineering and technology group Sener completed the first synchronization of the Noor III plant to the Moroccan grid in August. The company will start the final testing of Morocco’s Noor III solar power plant in Ouarzazate to prepare for commercial operation by the end of 2018, Sener wrote in a statement September 26. “Once operational, it will mark a turning point in the [solar power station] (CSP) sector worldwide,” said Anas Raisuni, Sener’s regional managing director in Morocco. According to the cabinet’s statement, the Noor Laayoune I and Noor Boujdour I solar power plants were also completed for “a combined capacity of 100 MW.” These two power plants were built under “an innovative financing plan that used the first green bond issue in the Kingdom.” The plants, which are part of a new development model, paved the way for further progress to benefit the local population and economic stakeholders in Western Sahara. At the meeting, the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (Masen) president, Mustapha Bakkoury, presented the King with the schedule for the implementation of the “Noor PV II program” and the construction of the Noor Midelt solar complex. The plant uses a mix of solar, thermal, and photovoltaic technologies. Construction of the 180-megawatt Midelt wind farm and the 100-megawatt Taza wind farm will start in 2019. In 2019, a repowering project for the Koudia El-Baida wind farm, in the Tangier-Tetouan region, will be launched. The farm is the first wind project in Morocco and has been operating since 2000 through Morocco’s National Office of Electricity (ONEE).  The repowering project will increase the farm’s capacity from 50 to 120 megawatts. The project will develop the wind energy resources in Morocco’s northern region. At the end of this meeting, King Mohammed VI gave his instructions “to increase the initial ambitions for renewable energy to exceed the current goal of 52 percent of the national electric mix by 2030.” The monarch directed Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to use renewable energy in public buildings to maximize energy efficiency and achieve significant savings. The King also stressed the need “to adopt an additional integrated program to back all the scheduled water desalination plants with renewable energy production units to ensure their autonomy and energy saving.”  The plans will rely primarily on the deposits available near the plants such as the wind power plant in Dakhla or through exploring new sources of energy, such as waste energy transformation in big cities. El Othmani and the King’s advisors, Fouad Ali El Himma and Yassir Zenagui, as well as Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun and Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah attended the meeting.

Rabat- On Saturday, October 27, a group of Moroccans residing in Belgium started drifting festively around a roundabout in Liege, Belgium. The less-than-cautious driving earned them arrests by the local police. The police arrested the drivers half an hour later, reported Belguim’s La Meuse news outlet. The cars had been decorated with Moroccan flags. A video of the incident has been circulating on social media with commenters saying that their fellow countrymen were giving Morocco a bad reputation and taking trouble wherever they go.

Rabat- The King warmly congratulated Bouteflika and his people on Thursday, wishing good health for the president and prosperity for the country. The King noted the “significance” of the occasion to recall “with pride” the Algerian people’s “heroic” sacrifices in pursuit of freedom and honored Morocco and Algeria’s common history and shared struggle for independence.  The King stressed to Bouteflika the need for the two “brother countries” to work together to strengthen each other and their relations and overcome challenges to their national peace and security. The Morocco-Algeria border, closed in 1994, is the longest closed land border in the world. Algeria observes its Revolution Day on November 1 to commemorate the beginning of its independence war against French colonization.  The war between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front began in 1954 and lasted until 1962, ending a 132-year colonization since 1830. France had considered Algeria part of France rather than one of its colonies.

Rabat – At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Hilale said on Wednesday that Morocco can track  the separatist group “every minute and every second.” Unlike the past, Hilale added, “we are now able to follow the movements of the separatists and we inform the UN Secretariat” by presenting satellite photos. When Morocco severed ties with Iran in May due to alleged collusion between Polisario and Hezbollah, Moroccan officials said that they had proof of ties between the separatist group and the Iranian ally through satellite pictures. Hilale’s statements followed the Security Council’s adoption of Resolution 2440, which pressured Polisario to refrain from any activities that might change the status quo in Western Sahara. Morocco also used its first high-resolution satellite, which weighs over 1,100 kilograms, to detect illegal activities from the Polisario Front east of Morocco’s defense wall earlier this year. Launched in 2017, the Mohammed VI-A satellite operates from Kourou, in French Guiana, at the Centre Spatial Guyanais. The satellite is dedicated to high-resolution imaging, with high resolution Imager (HiRI) playloads that can give a resolution of up to 70 centimeters and 28 inches. The satellite is capable of taking 500 images daily and updates its data every six hours, providing Morocco’s intelligence agencies with threat identification capabilities. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae quoted an anonymous military source on September 4, who said that Morocco is planning to launch a second surveillance satellite by the end of 2018. The source said that the project will cost Morocco €500 million and will be able to monitor activities on its borders, taking pictures with a precision of 50 centimeters. However, the Moroccan government has not yet announced the project publicly.

Rabat – Othman Benjelloun, CEO of BMCE Bank of Africa, expressed his wish to name the tower after King Mohammed VI in a speech before the King on Thursday, November 1. The building had the name “Bank of Africa Tower.” The Moroccan BMCE Bank of Africa is sponsoring the project, which will cost an estimated MAD 4 billion. The tower is expected be finished on May 30, 2022, BMCE Bank announced on October 11. The Mohammed VI Tower will have 55 floors with a luxury hotel, offices, and apartments. An observatory will crown the tower. The 250-meter tower could be titled the tallest building in Africa. The tower would replace Johannesburg’s Carlton Centre, currently the tallest at 223 meters. Benjelloun said that the tower project conducted “multidimensional preliminary studies” including geological, technical, architectural, and environmental since King Mohammed VI laid the first stone of the tower project on March 9, 2016. The Moroccan construction company TGCC and SIXCO (Six Construct), the Gulf subsidiary of the Belgian BESIX Group, signed  a contract to design and build the tower on October 4 in Dubai. The China Railway Construction Corporation International (CRCCI), which was originally contracted to build the tower, will continue to accompany the newly contracted companies. Johan Beerlandt, Chairman of BESIX board, spoke about his company’s international expertise in tower construction. BESIX Group was part of the construction of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest tower in the world, the Four Seasons Hotel in Manama, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, and the Carpe Diem towers in Paris. The group operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The Mohammed VI Tower will be the icon of the new Bouregreg Valley development project, a major part of the program “Rabat Ville Lumiere, Capitale Marocaine de la Culture” (Rabat, the City of Light, the Moroccan Capital of Culture).

By Trista Youssef On Tuesday, October 30, Taliban Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced the former detainees will join the Taliban’s political office in Doha. The Taliban’s Qatar office opened in 2013 at the US request to open up negotiations with the Taliban over Afghanistan’s political future. US officials had released the five members from Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl, a US soldier the Taliban held captive for nearly five years. US intelligence officials consider the five members a security threat. Since their 2014 release, Qatar has hosted the group under strict limitations, including restrictions on political involvement—until now. Some view the political involvement of the “Taliban five” as a potential step toward peace talks between the US and the Taliban. But others fear the group will maintain its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam, an interpretation that characterized the insurgent group’s five-year rule of Afghanistan ending in 2001. Hourin Mir, a political analyst in Kabul, stated: “The Taliban are bringing back their old generation, which means the Taliban have not changed their thinking or their leadership.…What we are more worried about is if tomorrow the Taliban say ‘we are ready to negotiate,’ who will represent Kabul? That is the big challenge because the government is so divided, not just ideologically but on ethnic lines.” Washington showed its resolve to end its involvement in the nearly $900 billion Afghanistan war with the appointment of Afghan-American Zalmay Khalilzad as envoy in early September. Khalilzad and Taliban officials held meetings in mid October. According to senior Taliban officials, the US agreed to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. Political analysts speculate that a deal between the Taliban and the US will not end the conflict. The divided Afghan government and the Taliban must also come to a domestic agreement.

The Moroccan city of Laayoune in Western Sahara will have its own medical and pharmaceutical school starting September 2022. The Saudi Fund for Development (SDF), which signed an agreement with Morocco, has given a grant to fund the MAD 30 billion project. Construction on the medical school is scheduled to begin in early 2019. Sitting on a plot of approximately 10 hectares, the school will be near Laayoune’s University Hospital Center (CHU) and will accommodate 2,000 students. The project aims to meet the growing medical needs of the population in Western Sahara. The project also hopes to increase the number of doctors in the region, by attracting young professionals to stay in the area. The SDF has also financed Agadir’s medical school.

The plane was destined for Pangkal Pinang, Indonesia, when it lost contact with air traffic control minutes after takeoff. There have been no reports of survivors. Recovery divers managed to retrieve the aircraft’s black box on Wednesday, which may provide clues as to what went wrong in the final minutes before the crash.  The BBC obtained flight logs which showed the same aircraft had previously experienced technical glitches the day before, affecting the plane’s altitude and speed. A chief executive for Lion Air said the problem was resolved “according to procedure” and that mechanics had cleared the aircraft for flight.  The aircraft was a Boeing 737 Max 8 model and was new to the Lion Air fleet. All of the other 737s in the fleet are currently undergoing inspection and Boeing has sent a team to assist in identifying any problems. In response to the crash, Lion Air has fired its technical director, Muhammad Asif. Lion Air is the largest domestic carrier in Indonesia, beginning operations in 2000. Since 2002, the airline has recorded 15 separate safety incidents. As a result, Europe and the US banned Lion Air flights in their territory from 2007 to 2016.  Minutes before the pilot lost contact, he had messaged air traffic control in Jakarta requesting to turn back to the airport.  Indonesian authorities also began the grim task of recovering the bodies and belongings of the passengers. Relatives of those onboard began filling out paperwork and providing DNA samples on Tuesday afternoon to help facilitate the identification of their loved ones.

Rabat- On Sunday, October 28, the towns and cities of Azrou, Midelt, Boulemane, El Hajeb, Imouzzer, and Ifrane in the Atlas Mountains woke up to the spellbinding view of 30 centimeters of snow.  More snow is expected to fall this week. Weather forecasts predict more snow on the reliefs of the High and Middle Atlas Mountains and the peaks of the Rif mountains on Thursday.  Moroccans have welcomed the early snow, and some tourists are feeling lucky to have chosen a fall vacation in the North African country. Snow in the Atlas usually falls in December or January. Last year, the first snow came in December.  In January, the country’s desert regions in the south, Ouarzazate, Taroudant, and Zagora, known for their extremely dry weather, experienced snowfall for the first time in more than 40 years. Today,  four days after the snow fell, it continues to coat the peaks of the High and Middle Atlas.  According to the Directorate of National Meteorology (DMN), the low temperatures today will range from 0 to 6 degrees Celsius on the reliefs; 5 to 10 degrees Celsius in the Oriental, Saiss, and the southeast regions; from 10 to 15 degrees Celsius in the northern, central, and the northern part of the southern provinces; and from 14 to 19 degrees Celsius in the far south.

President Aliyev met Minister Benabdelkader Tuesday in Baku. Benabdelkader was on a working visit to Azerbaijan  October 28-30, Maghreb Arab Press reported. During the reception, Aliyev talked about the development of relations between Azerbaijan and Morocco and expressed his hopes to strengthen trade relations between the two countries. Azerbaijan’s trade with Morocco totaled only $3.9 million in 2017, according to Azerbaijan’s State Customs Committee. Aliyev believes that the minister’s visit to Azerbaijan “will have a positive impact on bilateral relations between the two countries and contribute to raising awareness about the country,”  reported the Azerbaijan State News Agency (Azertac). Benabdelkader described the meeting with Aliyev as “indicative of the development of the existing excellent relations and manifestation of political will between the two countries.” Benabdelkader “congratulated President Ilham Aliyev on Azerbaijan’s successfully hosting major events of global significance, including the Baku Humanitarian Forum, European Games, Eurovision song contest, and the Islamic Solidarity Games,” wrote Azertac. Both agreed that the political relations between their countries “have very good history.” Morocco and Azerbaijan established diplomatic relations between Morocco and Azerbaijan in December 1992. The Azerbaijani president reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity over Western Sahara. Azerbaijan’s support is “in conformity with international law and stems from the fraternal relations existing between the two countries,” he added. Benabdelkader pointed out Morocco’s support for Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity. Morocco and Azerbaijan’s State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations (ASAN-Khedmat) signed an MoU in administration reform in June 2018 in Marrakech. Benabdelkader’s visit followed an invitation by the ASAN-Khedmat.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI and President Xi Jinping exchanged congratulatory messages Thursday on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Chinese-Moroccan diplomatic ties. “While welcoming the progress made in developing Chinese-Moroccan relations, I would like to assure Your Excellency of my firm determination to work, together with you, to strengthen the strategic partnership between our two countries and extend it to new promising sectors,” the King said in his message. The King asserted that Xi’s visit “will thus be an opportunity to renew contact and open up new and promising prospects for Chinese-Moroccan cooperation, which will serve the well understood interest of our two friendly peoples and their greatness,” Maghreb Arab Press reported. King Mohammed VI affirmed the need to take advantage of Chinese investment initiatives, particularly the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.   “These initiatives are likely to give concrete and realistic content to our cooperation relations at both bilateral and continental levels,” the monarch said. Xi vowed to partner with Morocco’s King to implement the agreements signed at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation’s 2018 Beijing Summit, Chinese CGTN reported. The King expressed his “deep” satisfaction with the excellent ties between Morocco and China and the great ambition of the countries to open up wider horizons. In his message, Xi said that Morocco was “one of the first African countries to build diplomatic relations with China.” The monarch also hailed “the richness of the historical and cultural heritage on which Chinese-Moroccan relations are based, the privileged relations that are constantly strengthening from year to year, at all levels.” Both sides agreed that ties between the two countries have developed rapidly since they formed a strategic partnership in May 2016 when King Mohammed VI visited China. Political relations between Morocco and China, according to the King, have experienced “a strong growth, marked by esteem, trust, solidarity and mutual support on issues of national priority and common interest.” Xi has called on the King to consolidate the political trust between China and Morocco and deepen bilateral cooperation, according to CGTN. In recent years, King Mohammed VI said, trade between China and Morocco “has grown rapidly and continuously such that China, a friendly country, now occupies a prominent position among the kingdom’s main economic partners at all levels.” Many Chinese companies have invested in Morocco, particularly in the automotive industry, aeronautics, and lately in fisheries. Tourism and journalism have also recently been fields of interest between the two countries. China is the third largest buyer of Morocco’s exports with a total trade of MAD 39.5 billion in 2016, up by 18.2 percent since 2001. China’s direct foreign investment in Morocco increased from MAD 362.5 million in 2016 to MAD 582.4 million for the first six months of 2017, according to the Moroccan industry ministry.

Rabat – During his meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Wednesday in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, west of Paris, Le Drian spoke about the Moroccan-French security cooperation. The French official said the Moroccan-French security cooperation “is essential to respond to the threat posed by the return of foreign fighters from the Syrian-Iraqi” conflict zones. Le Drian referred to Morocco is a “valuable ally in this common interest.” According to Maghreb Arab Press, the two officials discussed efforts to tackle migratory pressures in both countries. Le Drian said that Morocco and France must respond to this issue in “a spirit of firmness, responsibility and humanity.” Le Drian also spoke about cooperation between France and Morocco in education and youth employment, areas at the heart of priorities for both countries. Le Drian said that both countries share the same vision of the importance of diplomatic ties between the EU and Morocco. He added that both France and Morocco have common ambitions for the Mediterranean and cooperate closely on crisis resolution, especially in Libya. Earlier this week, Bourita reiterated Morocco’s support for the UN-led process to find a settlement to the Libyan crisis during a meeting with the UN personal envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salame.  Bourita emphasized that Morocco supports a Libyan-formed solution within the framework of the UN’s efforts as the only body capable of solving the problem.

Rabbah made the remarks in a keynote speech at the Moroccan 2018 Global Energy Day, an annual gathering of public officials, academics, and entrepreneurs in the energy sector.  The conference opened today in Rabat with discussions on energy challenges for Morocco and Africa. In his speech, the Moroccan minister mentioned the need for a collaborative African vision to “fully participate in the rapidly changing world of energy and new technologies.” For Rabbah, Morocco and the rest of Africa ought to be full participants in global changes if they are to minimize their overwhelming dependency on other regions.  “We may not end our dependence given the context of the world we live in, but we have to reduce our dependence level and count on our own ability to mobilize our own resources.” Africa and Morocco “have been left on the margins of the ongoing digital revolution,” the minister said, referring to the continent’s lagging energy and high-tech sectors. “We consume but we don’t participate; we don’t create enough.” Mastering energy sources is a necessary step towards sustainable and inclusive development.  However, the minister noted, Africa is unfortunately the region with the highest number of people without access to energy. And when they do have access, he added, it is of very limited quantity and quality. To bridge the gap between available resources and the demand for energy, the continent must “launch an African industrial revolution.” The revolution would entail investing in human resources by funding research. Referring to the conference’s theme—Building a Citizen Partnership for Affordable and Clean Energy—he concluded: “We need to reclaim social trust between different actors and social classes and rethink our place in the global challenge.”

Improving its 2018 global ranking of 69th by nine places, Morocco owes its score of 71.02 out of 100 to several new entrepreneurship-friendly policies. Thanks to these reforms, Morocco ranked the 2nd best country for doing business in the MENA region behind the United Arab Emirates, which came 11th worldwide and just ahead of Bahrain, which ranked 62nd.  Morocco came 3rd in Africa behind Mauritius, which ranked 20th globally and Rwanda at 29th. Morocco came ahead of South Africa, which ranked 82nd globally. According to the report, released Wednesday, October 31, Morocco has made it easier to start a business by reducing registration fees, easier to register property by  streamlining procedures, and easier to resolve insolvency. The report also noted that Morocco “made exporting and importing easier by implementing a paperless customs clearance system and improving infrastructure at the port of Tangier.” The World Bank ranked New Zealand, Singapore, and Denmark as the easiest countries for doing business and Venezuela, Eritrea, and Somalia as the hardest. The Moroccan National Committee for Business Environment is the body in charge of preparing a complete portfolio of Morocco’s major reforms to submit to the World Bank in Washington.

In the resolution, the 15 members of the Security Council calls on the Polisario Front to refrain from taking any action that might destabilize the region or seek to change the status quo in the areas located east of Morocco’s defense wall and the buffer strip at Guerguerat. In the second part of the sixth operative paragraph, the resolution “calls on the Frente Polisario to fully adhere to its commitments to the Personal Envoy with respect to Bir Lahlou, Tifariti, and the buffer strip at Guerguerat.” Analysts say that This paragraph in itself is a “winning card” for Morocco because it mentioned Tifariti, which has long been called a “liberated zone” by the separatist group.  The first draft resolution, obtained by Morocco World News, did not include Tifariti.  The final version Wednesday, however, added Tifariti, which Morocco considers a diplomatic gain. As a result of the strong language used in the new resolution against Polisario’s provocative actions, the front is unlikely to take similar actions to its moves in the past two years. It is not the first time the Security Council has warned against a change in the status quo of the region. In April, the Security Council voted on Resolution 2414, which expressed  concern over Polisario’s presence in Guerguerat. Like Resolution 2414, the new resolution renews MINURSO’s mandate for six months only, an extension that was highly supported by the US. France and other countries, such as Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire and Kuwait, supported the UN and Morocco’s preference for a one-year extension for MINURSO’s mandate. The US aimed for a six-month extension in order to pressure the parties to the conflict to show their willingness to be involved in serious negotiations before accepting a one-year extension for the MINURSO mandate. Morocco also has commended the resolution’s call for Algeria to show commitment to the UN-led political process.  Resolution 2440 “notes that invitations to an initial roundtable meeting in Geneva on 5 and 6 December 2018 were sent on 28 September 2018, welcomes that Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania have responded positively, and encourages them to work constructively with the Personal Envoy, in the spirit of compromise, throughout the duration of this process to ensure a successful outcome.” The resolution also shows support for the political process led by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler.

The Moroccan-born recording artist Karim Kharbouch, better known by his stage name French Montana, plans to pay for two brand new classrooms in the Sabae School, the American celebrity news website TMZ reported. The school is in the Fida-Mers-Sultan district in Casablanca, French Montana’s hometown in Morocco.  French Montana promised to fund school supplies for the Sabae School for the two classrooms in the years to come. French Montana has proved that he is holding to his roots, even though his family relocated to the United States when he was 13. As a well-known philanthropist fond of humanitarian work, especially in favor of women and children, Montana has raised money for good causes around the world. He helped build a hospital which serves more than 300,000 women in 40 villages in Uganda. French Montana was named Global Citizen Ambassador following the donation. “Me coming from Morocco in North Africa, I feel like it should be a soft spot for anyone that has a mother or a child. I think that’s got to be one of the worst things, not having the right healthcare. When I went to Uganda I felt obligated to help,” French Montana said. “I feel like every woman and child deserves the right healthcare. It shouldn’t be a privilege it should be a right,” he added. in another generous act, the artist took part in the Mass Bailout Movement. The movement aims to help pay bail for incarcerated women and children who cannot afford it. Montana also donated some of the profits from his “Famous” remix to help undocumented immigrants go to college as part of the “We Are The Dream Campaign.”

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has urged administrations across the country to use Tamazight side by side with Arabic. The two are Morocco’s two “official languages,” he said, according to “the fifth chapter of the constitution.”  El Othmani repeatedly asserted the need to use only Arabic and Tamazight in official documents instead of foreign languages. Tuesday’s statement notes the administrations’ “lack of consideration” of the government’s previous calls. Although El Othmani did not name “foreign languages,” he had previously said that French, the most used foreign language in the country, only signifies Morocco’s openness to foreign cultures. He said that public institutions should communicate in Arabic or Tamazight with citizens. El Othmani has encouraged the usage of Tamazight in essential documents such as contracts, ID cards, passports, drivers’ licenses, and banknotes in Morocco along with Arabic. He noted that some government officials in public institutions did not abide by the “obligation.”  The act has prompted the government to remove some files and documented decisions published in foreign languages, presumably in French, which has caused “financial losses” for the state. In previous speeches this year, El Othmani insisted that Tamazight should find a stronger presence in the Moroccan educational system, media and literature, because it is part of the country’s “rich national identity.” For Tamazight’s better integration in the educational system, the government presented draft laws 26.16 and 04.16.  The first law relates to the integration of Tamazight into national education and administrative institutions and the second to the National Council for the Languages and Culture of Morocco concerned with protecting and developing both Arabic and Tamazight. In a Parliament session in June, El Othmani said that the Radio and Television National Society (SNRT) should increase their broadcasting of the Tamazight television channel from 14 hours a day to 24 hours, as is the case for other television channels in Morocco. Morocco’s 2015-2030 strategic vision of education stresses the use of three common languages in the kingdom: Arabic and Tamazight as the official languages, and French as a means of “openness” to other cultures.

Benchaaboun urged German companies to invest in thriving sectors such as the automotive industry, aeronautics, electronics, and renewable energy, areas in which Germany has extensive experience, Maghreb Arab Press reported. Benchaaboun gave the statements in a speech at the G20 Investment Summit Tuesday in Berlin as part of the G20 “Compact with Africa” initiative. Benchaaboun pointed out the growth of Morocco’s economy despite an unfavorable international context. The minister attributed the growth to the reforms to strengthen macroeconomic stability and improve the business climate.  He also noted the signing of 17 free trade agreements, especially with other African countries. In addition, Morocco has a legislative framework that facilitates transparent investment. Speaking about Moroccan-German relations, the Moroccan minister described them as “exemplary.” He added that the two countries should further expand bilateral cooperation to include new sectors. At the summit, Benchaaboun and German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Muller signed a joint declaration of intent to encourage reforms. The aim of the declaration is to launch discussions under the name “Partnership to Encourage Reforms.” Benchaaboun thanked Germany for choosing Morocco as a priority country eligible for the initiative. German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched the G20 “Compact with Africa” initiative in 2017 to encourage African countries to introduce reforms. It also aims to promote private investment, particularly in infrastructure, for Africa’s sustainable economic development. 12 African countries joined the summit. During the summit, Merkel urged German companies to shift focus from Asia to Africa’s “huge” economic opportunities. “For many years we have been very focused on Asia. I think that in future we should turn our sights more on Africa,” Merkel said. According to Merkel, the development of Africa could help curb undocumented immigration to Europe.

By Josh Babb Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday acquitted Asia Bibi of making “derogatory remarks” about the Prophet Muhammad in a highly anticipated decision that was widely praised by human rights groups. The decision has also set off nationwide protests by religious political parties in Pakistan.  Bibi is a farmer and mother of four who has spent more than 8 years in prison since her conviction in 2010, relating to a dispute between Bibi and her neighbors over a bucket of water. Bibi was working in a field picking berries when she asked a group of women if they’d like some water, offering to bring it to them. That was when the women, who were Muslim, said they would never take water from Bibi since she is a Christian. Following this the women then claimed that Bibi made a series of “derogatory remarks” about the Prophet Muhammed for which Bibi was tried and sentenced to death.  Pakistan’s highest court ruled that these allegations did not hold up, saying the prosecution based their case on flimsy evidence and had not followed proper procedures. Chief Justice Mian Sabiq Nisar wrote, “This Court has held that ‘Commission of blasphemy is abhorrent and immoral … but at the same time a false allegation regarding commission of such an offence is equally detestable.’” The legacy of the case has been violent. Following Bibi’s original conviction, Salman Taseer, the provincial governor of Punjab, where Bibi had lived, began to speak out against her death sentence and questioned the legitimacy of the blasphemy ordinances.  As a result, Taseer was assassinated by his bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri, in 2011. Qadri stated in his confession that he had murdered Taseer in defense of Islam and the Prophet Muhammed.  Qadri was executed for his crime in 2016, but his legacy has lived on. Supporters of Qadri went on to establish the political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which garnered more than two million votes in Pakistan’s general election earlier this year.  Following the court’s ruling, the highly secured red zone in Islamabad, which contains the Supreme Court, was sealed off in anticipation of protests with paramilitary forces deploying to protect the court. Supporters of the TLP have staged demonstrations around the country in response to the verdict and clashes with police have been reported.  Bibi was not present for the court’s decision and instead was reached for comment by phone, reacting in disbelief. “I can’t believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?”  What happens next for Bibi remains to be seen. Several countries have offered her asylum, and she is expected to leave the country with her family.
