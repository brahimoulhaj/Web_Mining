Rabat – On Saturday, Algeria’s powerful National Army chief Gaid Salah reiterated his proposal, emphasizing that the implementation of Article 102 is the only solution that can get Algeria out of the current crisis. According to the army chief, “the position of the army on implementing  [Article 102] remains unchangeable.” In the Algerian constitution, Article 102 stipulates that “whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” Earlier this week, Gaid Salah made a similar statement, calling on Bouteflika to step down. Salah’s statement left many Algerians in shock, as the top army chief is known for his unwavering support for Bouteflika. Some protesters translated Salah’s position as a “circumentive” measure against the demands of protesters. On Friday, thousands of people rallied in Algiers, calling for the immediate resignation of Bouteflika as his fourth mandate is almost expired. Algerian security services faced the protests with tear gas and water cannons to disperse protests against the Algerian government. Protesters demand an overhaul of reforms. Friday marked the sixth week of the protests, which began on February 22 after Bouteflika announced his plans to run for a fifth term.

Rabat – Arab world leaders have reiterated their rejection of the US President’s decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. It annexed the territory in 1981 and has since maintained control over it. During the 30th Arab League summit in Tunis, Arab leaders expressed their full support for the Palestinian cause. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said that “it is unreasonable for the Arab region to continue to be at the forefront of tensions and crisis.” In addition to King Salman, Egypt’s Abdelfattah Al Sissi also condemned the move. Commenting on the decision, King Salman of Saudi Arabia said: “We reiterate our categorical rejection of measures that would undermine Syrian sovereignty over the Golan.” However, political observers said that Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, including UAE, would do little to protect the rights of Palestinians due to their close diplomatic ties with the Trump administration. Political analyst at Qatar University Majed al-Ansari told Al Jazeera that “there is very little intention to come up with very clear outcomes other than the usual discourse of establishing Palestine right and the general Arab stance on regional issues.” On March 28, King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan condemned rejected Trump’s unilateral policies on the Palestinian issue and the occupied Golan Heights.  The two monarchs said Trump’s decision violates international law and reiterated their principled support for Syria’s territorial integrity. The two Kings also reiterated unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Rabat – Pope Francis arrived in Morocco early in the afternoon on Saturday for a two-day visit to Morocco, his first ever trip to the country. The landmark trip aims to promote interfaith, dialogue, and coexistence.  After giving a speech at Hassan tower, the Pope headed to Rabat’s Royal Palace where he and King Mohammed VI signed the “Al-Quds Call,” which aims to preserve the holy city of Palestine, and to safeguard its shared heritage. Pope Francis then posed for a photo with the royal family. The photo shows Pope Francis with Mohammed VI, Prince Moulay El Hassan, Prince Moulay Rachid, and the princesses Lalla Khadija, Lalla Meryem, Lalla Asmae, Lalla Hasnaa, and Lalla Oum Keltoum with her son Prince Moulay Ahmed who is just two years old. The 5 princesses all wore elegant Moroccan kaftans for the occasion, while King Mohammed VI, Prince Moulay El Hassan, and Prince Moulay Rachid, wore traditional jellabas and red fez hats. Kaftans have been one of the key staples of Moroccan culture since the 16th century. The dress, worn by Moroccan women on their wedding day and other special occasions, is often long-sleeved, with buttons and embroidery down the middle and a belt at the waist.  Morocco’s princesses are almost always seen in stunningly intricate kaftans at official events, as is the tradition.

Rabat – Pope Francis arrived at the Cathedral of Rabat on the morning of Sunday, March 31, to cries of “bienvenidos,” “bienvenue,” and “MarHaba” from an elated and international group of priests, church leaders, and consecrated religious people of many denominations. Nuns of the order of Mother Teresa joined Franciscan monks and leaders of Orthodox churches in North Africa. Although the pews were full, the cathedral gathering felt intimate compared to the afternoon mass, where nearly 10,000 worshipers joined the pope at a stadium just outside Rabat.   At the beginning of the meeting, Pope Francis warmly greeted Father Jean-Pierre Schumacher, the last surviving monk of Tibhirine, who is currently living in the Convent of Our Lady of the Atlas in Midelt. Speaking at the cathedral, Pope Francis welcomed the fact that Christians are free to practice their religion in Morocco which fosters the strengthening of dialogue, cooperation and friendship between Muslims and Christians. Pope Francis reiterated his call for interfaith dialogue, a message he delivered a day earlier, speaking with King Mohammed VI. The pope made it clear that such dialogue is not “a strategy for increasing [the church’s] membership.” “Christians are a minority in this country. Yet, to my mind, this is not a problem.” The pope said that proselytizing “leads always to a cul-de-sac,” and that it is Christians’ spiritual and social work that is paramount. “Jesus did not choose us and send us forth to become more numerous! He called us to a mission.” That mission, he said, is not determined by the “number or size of spaces that we occupy, but rather by our capacity to generate change and to awaken wonder and compassion.” The pope explained that “charity, especially towards the vulnerable,” is the best means to build a culture of dialogue. “Dialogue, then, becomes prayer,” he added.  Miguel Angel, a Franciscan monk living in the northern Moroccan city of El Hoceima, told Morocco World News that his monastery runs a center caring for mentally ill people, all of whom are Moroccan Muslims. He practices his religion by helping people in need, he said. “We came to help our brothers. We are interested in the people, not their religion. The person, no matter what they believe, is a child of God.” Seated on the dais, the Pope was flanked on either side by Morocco’s two archbishops, Father Cristóbal Lopez Romero of Rabat and Father Santiago Agrelo Martinez of Tangier. “I would like all Christians and Muslims around the world to know that we are brothers and not rivals, and we are working together in the land of Morocco to build a world of justice and peace,” Archbishop of Tangier, Santiago Agrelo Martínez, told reporters. Most of those in the cathedral were elders, reflecting the aging population of the Catholics in Europe. But at the end of the ceremony, four children ran up to greet the pope on stage, to laughter and cheers from the audience.   Most of Morocco’s current Christians are young immigrants from sub-Saharan African countries. Omar, a young Protestant from Niger studying in Rabat, saw the pope’s visit as helping Morocco’s Christian minority. “It shows us that there is really a freedom of worship, for us, being foreigners in this country.” Read Also: Papal Visit: Majority of Christians in Morocco Come From Sub-Saharan Africa

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has said that he is the “Guarantor of the free practice of religion” in a speech given to celebrate Pope Francis’ first visit to Morocco on Saturday. Peace, tolerance, and coexistence between the three Abrahamic religions were the focus of the King’s speech delivered at the Hassan mosque plaza in front of hundreds of attendees. The speech is part of the celebration for Pope Francis’ first visit in history to Morocco. In his address, the King emphasized the freedom to practice all religions in his country. “I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco,” said the King in his speech. The monarch, who delivered his speech in four languages, said that he is the  Commander of all believers. “And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom,” added the monarch. The King conveyed Morocco’s penchant for coexistence, which honors the tradition of mutual understanding and moderation between all religions. The monarch also stressed that Morocco’s principles and tolerance are against all forms of indifference. “I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” said the monarch. US International Religious Freedom report in 2017 said the number of Christians living in the major-Muslim country is ranging between 2,000 to 6,000 Christians. Other NGOs estimate that the number might be higher. The French arm of the Dutch Open Doors NGO said that the number of Christians living in Morocco is 32,000. In addition to Christians, 2,000 Jews live in Morocco,  estimated the Jewish Agency in 2018. In a message addressed to the UN General Assembly in September 2018, King Mohammed VI emphasized that Morocco is a land of all religions, emphasizing the presence of multiculturalism and peaceful relations between people of different faiths in the North African country. “Morocco, where Arab-Islamic, African and Judeo-Christian civilizations have long mingled, honors an immutable tradition of moderation, coexistence and mutual understanding,” the King said.

Rabat – Arlene Urmunita spent the first half of her Sunday morning on the phone coordinating a family reunion. She was indicating to apparently lost relatives the right place to meet before the historic papal mass in Rabat. “I’m at the main entrance, where are you?” Urmunita told a relative on phone.  As Urmunita spoke, a flurry of people crowded around her, hustling to get inside the venue of the mass. On an occasion such as what Rabat was witnessing on Sunday, March 31, getting a seat with panoramic view of the mass — and of course a better view of the pope — came with grueling efforts. Urmunita’s vicinity was bustling with people, speaking flusteredly into her phone her voice was barely audible. “No, that’s not the right place. That’s the pope’s entrance,” she told her relatives. Urmunita, 41, is a practicing Catholic working in Rabat as a nanny. She is originally from the Philippines. Every Sunday, Urminita attends mass Rabat’s St. Peter’s Cathedral with four of her family members. For the papal mass, the Rabat cathedral distributed free tickets to all its members. Urmunita and her four family members received a ticket each. The orange caption on each ticket, “for the faithful,” came with a combined sense of joy and achievement. It meant the family’s routine, attending every Sunday mass, was being rewarded with the most gratifying trophy many Roman Catholic would pray for: Celebrating mass in the “holy presence” of the pope, also known as the “the father of all believers.” The pope’s second and final day began in the city of Temara, southwest of Rabat, where he visited the Rural Center for Social Services. He then proceeded to St. Peter’s Cathedral to give a speech to the dozens of religious leaders and supporters that filled the pews. During his speech, Pope Francis saluted the freedom of religious practice that Christians enjoy in Morocco. That Christians could freely attend to their religious duty in Morocco, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, spoke volumes about the possibility of peaceful interfaith relations, the pope said. The Christian community in Morocco is approximately 2,000 to 5,000 people. It is estimated that 99 percent of Morocco’s population of 34 million is Muslim. In his speeches during his two-day stay in Morocco, he indefatigably spoke about strengthening dialogue, cooperation, and friendship between Muslims and Christians. But the pontiff also noted the need for Morocco’s Christians to prioritize spiritual and social work over proselytizing, which is illegal in Morocco.  “Jesus did not choose and send us forth to become more numerous. He called us to a mission,” Pope Francis said. That mission, he elaborated, is not determined by “the number or size of spaces that we occupy, by rather by our capacity to generate change and awaken wonder and compassion.” Following his speech, Pope Francis had lunch with priests and the Council of Churches before departing to hold mass for Urmunita and the thousands that had already began to hustle their way into the Prince Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex. “It was so important to us to see the pope and we are so blessed to be here,” Urmunita told Morocco World News. “This visit will change the attitude of the people. Seeing the king and the pope meet will strengthen the friendship between Muslims and Christians in Morocco.” The mass was the final — and culminating — event of Pope Francis’s two-day trip to Morocco. The pope’s Moroccan stay placed an emphatic focus on interfaith dialogue and issues of migration. On the first day of his visit, Pope Francis visited organizations and institutions working on those issues, the Mohammed VI center for Islamic studies and the Caritas migration center. After saying mass, the pope drove to the Rabat-Sale Airport for his farewell ceremony before flying back to Rome onboard a Royal Air Maroc flight. “We are all sad to see the pope leave, we will miss him very much here in Morocco,” Urmunita said. Pope Francis’s next international visit will be to Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from May 5-7.

Rabat – Morocco’s Philharmonic Orchestra prepared a special performance to celebrate Pope Francis’ visit in Morocco at the request of King Mohammed VI. During the spiritual moment, three people representing the three Abrahamic religions stood in front of King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis to perform religious songs from Muslim, Christian, and Hebrew traditions. The performance began with the sound of double bass and the Islamic call to prayer (addhan) performed by the muezzin Smahi El Hadni, who wore a green Djellaba and a white cape.  Wearing a fabulous green caftan, French singer Francois Atlan chanted the Jewish prayer known as Adonai, followed by El Hadni. The soprano singer, who is also the daughter of orchestra chief Jean-Claude Casadesus, Carlone Casesus joined the theater to chant Caccini’s motet Ave Maria. The performance amazed the crowd, who attended the ceremony held at the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates (Islamic counselors). King Mohammed VI was accompanied by the Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan and  his brother Prince Moulay Rachid. During the reception, the King and his guest watched an film  made by the institue on its goals, missions, and various achievements. The Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq also gave a speech before the two leaders, emphasizing that  King Mohammed VI has put in place reforms and introduced a dynamic of concordance between the modern institutional frameworks and the purposes of religion in different aspects. During the ceremony, two students from the Mohammed VI institute shared their experiences in the institution. Aboubakr Hmaidouch, a French student of North African origin, pointed out that the Muslim community in France is in great need of imams and preachers. The values of religion, he said, contribute to living together and to spiritual well-being in society. After the terrorist attacks that struck France in 2015, Hamaidouch said he felt the need to “acquire knowledge and communication skills” to be effective in a “society shaped by multiple currents and sometimes by ready-made ideas. “The papal visit is part of a landmark trip to emphasize the importance of coexistence between the Abrahamic religions. Both King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis delivered speeches on the importance of inter-religious dialogue and coexistence. In his speech, King Mohammd VI said that he is keen to “ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom.” He added “I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco.”

Rabat – The Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf said that Arab countries must remain united in the face of global challenges, at a meeting of the Arab League Executive Council on March 30 in Tunis. The threat posed by Iran is the biggest challenge for the Arabs, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Assaf said Friday. “One of the most dangerous forms of terrorism and extremism is what Iran’s… blatant interference in Arab affairs and its militias… the Revolutionary Guards in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, who require us to work together,” he said. Al-Assaf also spoke about his county’s “balanced relations and contacts on the international scene.” Saudi Arabia “coordinates positions with Arab countries to positively influence the causes of the Arab world on the international stage,” the Saudi Press Agency quoted Al-Assaf as saying. Al-Assaf said that Saudi Arabia supports the Skhirat agreement, signed in December 2015. The agreement is “a road map for the political solution to the Libyan crisis”, he said. On March 26, King Salman received Marshal Khalifa Haftar on a two-day visit to Riyadh. Haftar had announced, in December 2017, the “end” of the Skhirat agreement which provided for the formation of the Government of National Unity. According to Haftar, “All the bodies stemming from this agreement lost their legitimacy.” On March 28, Rabat sent an indirect message to Riyadh about the situation in Libya. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that coordination between allies should be “two-way. It should not be on demand. It should cover all the important issues in the Middle East as in North Africa, like the Libyan crisis.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI of Morocco amazed the world as he shared his thoughts and beliefs on religious peace, tolerance, and coexistence in four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish. At the Hassan mosque plaza on Saturday, King Mohammed VI  began his speech in Arabic, emphasizing that it was an exceptional day in Morocco for two reasons. “It is exceptional because of the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis. It is also exceptional because it reminds me of the historical visit the late Pope John Paul II paid to Morocco,” said the King. In fluent Spanish, King Mohammed VI spoke about coexistence and the “exceptional” rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. “It is reflected by the mosques, churches, and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom since time immemorial.” King Mohammed VI received respect and applause from the attendees for his decision to convey words of tolerance and peace in four different languages. In English, the monarch called on interfaith dialogue between the three Abrahamic religions, which “were not created to be tolerant of one another out of some unavoidable fate, or out of courtesy to one another,” according to the King.  The King concluded his speech in French, emphasizing that “spirituality is not an end in itself. Our faith translates into concrete actions. It teaches us to love our fellow human beings and to help them.” Pope Francis arrived in Morocco on Saturday for his first ever official visit in Morocco. King Mohammed VI, accompanied by Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, and Prince Moulay Rachid, received the pope. The Pope’s second day in Morocco has a busy schedule. The Pope will start his day by visiting the Center for Social Services in Temara, a city near Rabat. The Pope will then meet with religious men and women in Rabat’s cathedral. Before heading back to the Vatican, Pope Francis will celebrate the Catholic mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium in Rabat.

By Sebastian Bouknight Rabat – Eight hundred years earlier, St. Francis of Assisi had wished to visit Morocco’s sultan but could not, due to illness. His ambition, Toufiq explained, illustrates that the Vatican has known for centuries that Morocco is the seat of the Amir al-Muminin, or Commander of the Faithful. The visit of Pope Francis—who adopted the saint’s name upon his inauguration in 2013—brought this ambition to fruition. King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s current Commander of the Faithful, invited the pope to reinvigorate “interfaith dialogue, mutual understanding between the faithful of the two religions, and [promote] the values of peace and tolerance.” Visiting the Institute The two religious leaders visited the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Preachers. On the shining marble floor of the entry hall, hundreds of student imams waited to enter the lecture hall. The crowd showed the institute’s reach: Chadian students dressed in all white, students from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal in a brilliant array of colors. Of the institute’s 3,000 male and female students, nearly half are foreign, mostly from West African countries. Standing below the intricately carved, arched ceiling, Hassan, a student imam from Côte d’Ivoire, told Morocco World News the pope’s visit was a welcome confirmation that “Christians and Muslims are all brothers, all human beings.” Interfaith dialogue is vital to his home country, he explained. “Most of my friends are Christian. Even in the same family, you can find Muslims and Christians.” Like all of his international classmates, Hassan will return home after his two-year program to guide his community with the inclusive Islamic teachings learned in Morocco. Protecting Against Extremism After arriving, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI sat beside each other in elegant red and gold chairs, facing the stage, to watch a promotional video for the institute, shown in Spanish for the Argentinean Holy Father. King Mohammed VI founded the institute in 2014 to build for the Muslim world a scholarly buttress against the dangers of extremist ideology. By promoting Morocco’s inclusive, spiritual interpretation of Islam, Minister Toufiq explained, the institute helps to protect the religion. Two foreign students addressed the monarchs, the audience of students, the papal entourage and leaders of Morocco’s government. Both had sought the institute’s Islamic education in order to combat extremism back home. The violence of extremist group Boko Haram sparked Hind Usman, a young woman from northeastern Nigeria, to leave her work as a microbiologist to study Islam in Morocco. Extremism preys on religious people who are moved by “passion rather than knowledge,” she said. Usman hopes to return home and educate her community against manipulation and “influence tolerance, love, and peaceful coexistence between Muslims, Christians,” and those of other faiths. Likewise, the 2015 terrorist attacks in France spurred Aboubakr Hmaidouch, a French student imam and industrial designer to study in Morocco. “I knew that these crimes were against religion,” he said, and “realized that there was a need for voices to speak up . . . against this ideology of death.” A Musical Message of Unity After these students spoke, the curtains opened to an orchestra. An imam, chanting the Muslim call to prayer, walked onto the stage as cellos droned. As the orchestra swelled, a Jewish woman singing a Hebrew prayer and a Christian woman singing the Ave Maria joined him. The musical mélange, a clear message of unity between believers of the three Abrahamic faiths, moved the two holy leaders. After thanking the musicians and the students, the king and pope left the institute to dine together in the Royal Palace. Today, March 31, Pope Francis will preside over a Catholic Mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah sports complex at 2:45 p.m.

Rabat – A Moroccan Ambassador has said in a statement that terrorism has little to do with religion and a lot more with the social system.  The Moroccan Ambassador to Italy, Hassan Abou Ayoub, has stated that Morocco combats radicalism and terrorism through an integrated approach of security and education that has borne fruits beyond Moroccan borders. Speaking at a seminar on “the future of extremism in the countries of the Maghreb,” Ayoub said that the success story of Morocco’s “unique efforts” to curb extremism lies in its attempt to promote an alternative religious rhetoric at mosques.  Religious Reforms as a counter-terrorism strategy “This is achieved through training Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates (religious guides) in countries that are victims of extremism, notbaly Africa, Sahel and, Europe,” the ambassador noted, referring to the multiple reforms that Rabat has initiated in recent years to emerge as its region’s bulwark of counter-extremism. Morocco’s counter-terrorism strategy has been deployed on targets three main fronts: stepping up internal security, eradicating poverty, and spearheading religious reforms.  On the religious front, Morocco has especially invested in promoting values of moderation and tolerance both domestically and abroad through education programs, community building, and religious training. In 2015, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates. The institute has since been dedicated to the training of Imams from the African continent and Europe.  It has been touted for cultivating values of tolerance and coexistence. The institute is part of a broader Moroccan plan to stand up to all forms of religious extremism. But the institution also seeks to preserve  the spiritual identity of Moroccans. According to Ambassador Hassan Abou Ayoub, “Morocco intends to to propagate moderate values of Islam to combat the proliferation of radical ideologies.” Since the terrorist attack in Casablanca on May 16, 2003, the deadliest terrorist attack in Morocco’s history, Morocco has undertaken to implement vigilant security measures to combat Islamic radicalism.  The approach, Ayoub elaborated, has proved effective l and has had tangible impacts beyond Morocco. “Many countries like England, Belgium, and Germany, have benefited from it.”  Vision and effective social policies King Mohammed VI’s “clear vision” has anticipated events differently from the usual approach of “ emergency treatment, which is inappropriate,” he continued. Pointing out that the proliferation of extremism is mostly due to the social system, the Moroccan ambassador said that “Europe has made mistakes by failing to give priority to Africa in the face of problems relating to development … Poverty drives people to turn to extremisms.” But Ayoub regretted that European countries still lack a unified counter-terrorism strategy because of big political differences.”  Meanwhile, he concluded, Morocco has been an invaluable EU ally on security and extremism related issues. “Morocco’s outstanding counter-terrorism policy have benefitted many European countries like Germany, England, and Belgium.” The ambassador’s comments tune with King Mohammed VI’s repeated insistence on enlightened and responsible leadership to meet the challenges facing Morocco and the world today.  In his welcoming speech on the occasion of Pope Francis’ ongoing visit to Morocco, the King reiterated his belief that right leaders and good religious education can prevail as the world pains to come to terms with the instrumentalization of religions. “As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” the King said.

Rabat – In a speech delivered at the Esplanade of the Hassan Mosque on the occasion of the official visit of his holiness Pope Francis to Morocco, the Sovereign underlined the importance of education to tackle radicalism. The three Abrahamic religions, according to the King, were created “to open up to one another and to know one another.” Religions offers venues to fight against radicalism through knowing one another, which will help rise to the challenges of our tormented times through education, King Mohammed VI. “To tackle radicalism, the solution is neither military nor financial; that solution has but one name: Education,” the monarch said. He noted that in the face of ideology-linked violence and extremism prevailing in many parts of the world today, “it is clear the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions is insufficient.” The Moroccan monarch pleaded for rethinking the role of education in the struggle against extremism. In his view, ignorance, or erroneous interpretation of the peaceful and humanity-celebrating messages of religions, is the primary source of many of the problems facing the world. He said, “My plea for education is an indictment of ignorance. It is binary conceptions and the fact of not knowing one another well enough that are threatening our civilizations; it is certainly not religion.” When taught, understood, and practiced as recommended in the Scriptures, religion can be a source of blossoming relations between people and countries, King Mohammed VI suggested, Sovereign pointing out that what all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. He said they instrumentalize religion and rob its purpose of spreading peace and mutual understanding. Religion, the King noted, is Light, Knowledge, Wisdom and Peace, and it should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people using it to spread ignorance and  intolerance. “That is why, as Commander of the Faithful, I am advocating today that we give back to religion its rightful place in education,” the King said. Pope Francis’s visit is taking place at a time when the Community of Nations – just like that of all Believers – is facing a number of challenges. And to rise up to such crises, the King said, “we need to tackle these new ills which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the Divine Message by advocating the denial of the Other and similar wicked theories.” In a world in search of direction, the Kingdom of Morocco has never stopped proclaiming, teaching and experiencing, on a daily basis, Brotherhood among the Sons of Abraham, the Sovereign stressed, adding that this is a founding pillar of the exceptionally rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. The symbiotic relationship uniting Moroccans – beyond their faiths – is an eloquent example in this regard, according to the King. He underlined that the symbiosis is a reality in everyday life in Morocco, and is reflected by the mosques, churches, and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom for centuries. “As King of Morocco and Commander of the Faithful, I am the Guarantor of the free practice of religion. I am Commander of all believers.” And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom. I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco,” the King said. Security and peace have been Morocco’s distinctive marks in a region mostly associated with socio-economic crises and political strife. Part of Morocco’s successful security architecture comes down to the series of reforms the King launched since 2015 to reinforce Morocco’s position as a fortress against extremist discourses. King Mohammed VI particularly recalled the setting up of the Mohammed VI Ulema Foundation and the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams as well as male and female religious guides. Over the years, the institute has received young people from several European and African countries. It has been touted as the nest of a new generation of imams, versed in subjects as diverse as philosophy, theology, and psychology, but also equipped to deal with the complexities of the modern world. King Mohammed VI said that his meeting with his holiness Pope Francis attests to a mutually held belief that the values of monotheism contribute to rationalization, to reconciliation and to improving the world order. “As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” the monarch underlined. The Sovereign also said that he has been following with interest and appreciation the efforts made by his holiness to serve peace in the world, as well as his regular calls to promote education and dialogue, to end violence, to combat poverty and corruption, to tackle climate change – to fight the ills plaguing human societies. “Our messages do not concern our time only; they are eternal. They call upon people to embrace the values of moderation, to fulfil the imperatives of knowing one another and to raise awareness of otherness,” the King pointed out.

By Sarah Goodman &amp; Sebastian Bouknight “We had a month of perfect sunshine, until today,” remarked a Moroccan woman under an umbrella awaiting King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis II on Saturday, March 30 at the Tour Hassan Mausoleum. It was a testament to the power of faith that the weather did not deter the men and women who dutifully waited for hours in the rain for the chance to see the leaders, both of whom serve as political and religious heads of state. During Pope Francis visit to Morocco, the crowd awaiting the motorcade stood with umbrellas, crouched under plastic tarps, shielded themselves with seat cushions, or stood stoically in the rain. A convoy carrying the two monarchs made its way through the streets of Rabat to the Royal Palace; the flags of Morocco and the Vatican fluttered above the roadways and from the mausoleum flagpoles. Security was tight, and guests filed through metal detectors before entering the walled enclave. Equally dutiful onlookers—many were Moroccans who arrived in the morning on a series of buses—packed the sidewalks or watched from awnings on the streets opposite. Mohammed VI spoke first, espousing tolerance and dialogue between “the three Abrahamic religions.” “The reason they exist is to open up to one another and to know one another, so as to do good to one another.” Speaking at different points in Spanish, Arabic, English, and French, the King decried what he referred to as “the phenomena of radicalization.” “What all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. Today, religion should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people, for ignorance or for intolerance.” Pope Francis, addressing the expectant listeners, corroborated the King’s vision, denouncing extremism a negation of religion rather than an expression of it: “[extremism] is an offense against religion and against God himself.” The mood felt expectant, even celebratory: choruses of ululating and choir hymns were both audible over from the people assembled. Morocco is a Muslim-majority nation and many of the country’s Catholics are from other parts of Africa or the world.  Speaking to Morocco World News, a young Catholic woman from Guinea-Bissau shared that she was “very happy,” despite the cold and wet. Shuffling her feet to keep warm, she animatedly shared that she lives in Marrakech and made the trip for the purpose of seeing and hearing the pope speak. This sentiment was echoed by another woman from Burundi, who said in an interview that it was an unexpected “pleasure” to hear the pope, an experience she had not expected to have during her two years in Morocco. The pope later made a visit to the offices of Caritas, a Catholic charitable organization, to discuss the plight of migrants in Morocco.

Rabat – Pope Francis delivered Saturday in Rabat a speech at the official welcome ceremony held in his honor at the Esplanade of the Hassan Mosque, which was chaired by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Commander of the Faithful. Here follows the official translation of the speech: “Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highnesses,
Distinguished Authorities of the Kingdom of Morocco,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Dear Friends,
As-Salam Alaikum! I am pleased to set foot in this country so filled with natural beauty, while at the same time preserving the traces of ancient civilizations and bearing witness to a long and fascinating history. Before all else, I would like to express my deep gratitude to His Majesty King Mohammed VI for his kind invitation, for the warm welcome which he has given me in the name of the entire Moroccan people, and, in particular, for his gracious introduction. This visit is for me an occasion of joy and gratitude, for it allows me to see at first hand the richness of your land, your people and your traditions. I am also grateful that my visit offers a significant opportunity for advancing inter-religious dialogue and mutual understanding among the followers of our two religions, as we commemorate – at a distance of eight centuries – the historic meeting between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al-Kamil. That prophetic event shows that the courage to encounter one another and extend a hand of friendship is a pathway of peace and harmony for humanity, whereas extremism and hatred cause division and destruction. It is my hope that our mutual esteem, respect and cooperation will help strengthen the bonds of sincere friendship, and enable our communities to prepare a better future for coming generations. In this land, a natural bridge between Africa and Europe, I would like to affirm once more our need for cooperation in giving new impetus to the building of a world of greater solidarity, marked by honest, courageous and indispensable efforts to promote a dialogue respectful of the richness and distinctiveness of each people and every individual. All of us are called to rise to this challenge, especially at the present time, when our differences and our lack of reciprocal knowledge risk being exploited as a cause for conflict and division. If we wish, then, to share in the building a society that is open, fraternal and respectful of differences, it is vital to foster the culture of dialogue and adhere to it unfailingly, to adopt mutual cooperation as our code of conduct and reciprocal understanding as our method and standard. We are called to pursue this path tirelessly, in the effort to help each other overcome tensions and misunderstandings, clichés and stereotypes that generate fear and opposition. In this way, we will encourage the growth of a fruitful and respectful spirit of cooperation. It is likewise essential that fanaticism and extremism be countered by solidarity on the part of all believers, grounded in the lofty shared values that inspire our actions. For this reason, I am happy that I will shortly visit the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates. Established by Your Majesty, the Institute seeks to provide effective and sound training to combat all forms of extremism, which so often lead to violence and terrorism, and which, in any event, constitute an offense against religion and against God himself. We know how important it is to provide a suitable preparation for future religious leaders, if we wish to awaken a genuinely religious spirit in the heart of future generations. Authentic dialogue, then, makes us appreciate more fully the importance of religion for building bridges between people and successfully meeting the challenges that I mentioned above. While respecting our differences, faith in God leads us to acknowledge the eminent dignity of each human being, as well as his or her inalienable rights. We believe that God created human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity, and he calls them to live as brothers and sisters and to spread the values of goodness, love and peace. That is why freedom of conscience and religious freedom – which is not limited to freedom of worship alone, but allows all to live in accordance with their religious convictions – are inseparably linked to human dignity. In this regard, there is a constant need to progress beyond mere tolerance to respect and esteem for others. This entails encountering and accepting others in their distinctive religious beliefs and enriching one another through our diversity, in a relationship marked by good will and by the pursuit of ways we can work together.
Understood in this way, creating bridges between people – from the point of view of interreligious dialogue – calls for a spirit of mutual regard, friendship and indeed fraternity. The International Conference on the rights of religious minorities in Muslim countries, held in Marrakech in January 2016, addressed this issue, and I am pleased to note that it condemned, in effect, any exploitation of religion as a means of discriminating against or attacking others. It also stressed the need to move beyond the concept of religious minority in favor of that of citizenship and the recognition of the value of the person, which must have a central place in every legal system. I also see as a prophetic sign the creation in 2012 of the Al Mowafaqa Ecumenical Institute in Rabat. The Institute, an initiative of Catholics and other Christian denominations in Morocco, seeks to help promote ecumenism, as well as dialogue with culture and with Islam. This praiseworthy undertaking manifests the concern and the desire of the Christians living in this country to build bridges as a means of expressing and serving human fraternity. All these are ways to halt the misuse of religion to incite hatred, violence, extremism and blind fanaticism, and the invocation of the name of God to justify acts of murder, exile, terrorism and oppression. The genuine dialogue we want to encourage also leads to a consideration of the world in which we live, our common home. The International Conference on Climate Change, COP 22, also held here in Morocco, once more demonstrated that many nations are conscious of the need to protect this planet where God has placed us to live and to contribute to a true ecological conversion for the sake of integral human development. I express my appreciation for the progress being made in this area and I am gratified by the growth of authentic solidarity between nations and peoples in the effort to find just and lasting solutions to the scourges that threaten our common home and the very survival of the human family. Only together, in patient, judicious, candid and sincere dialogue, can we hope to devise adequate solutions for reversing the trend of global warming and to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty. Similarly, today’s grave migration crisis represents an urgent summons for concrete actions aimed at eliminating the causes that force many people to leave country and family behind, often only to find themselves marginalized and rejected. Last December, once more here in Morocco, the Intergovernmental Conference on the Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration adopted a document intended to serve as a point of reference for the entire international community. At the same time, much still remains to be done, especially in passing from the commitments undertaken there, at least in principle, to concrete actions, and, more particularly, to a change of attitude towards migrants, one that sees them as persons, not numbers, and acknowledges their rights and dignity in daily life and in political decisions. You are aware of my great concern for the frequently grim fate of such people, who for the most part would not have left their countries were they not forced to do so. I trust that Morocco, which hosted that Conference with great openness and exceptional hospitality, will continue to be an example of humanity for migrants and refugees within the international community, so that here, as elsewhere, they can find generous welcome and protection, a better life and a dignified integration into society. When conditions permit, they can then decide to return home in conditions of safety and respect for their dignity and rights. The issue of migration will never be resolved by raising barriers, fomenting fear of others or denying assistance to those who legitimately aspire to a better life for themselves and their families. We know too that the consolidation of true peace comes through the pursuit of social justice, which is indispensable for correcting the economic imbalances and political unrest that have always had a major role in generating conflicts and threatening the whole of humanity. Your Majesty,
Distinguished Authorities,
Dear friends! Christians are deeply appreciative of the place accorded them in Moroccan society. They wish to do their part in building a fraternal and prosperous nation, out of concern for the common good of its people. In this regard, I think of the significant work of the Catholic Church in Morocco in providing social services and in the field of education, thanks to its schools, which are open to students of every confession, religion and background. In thanking God for all that has been accomplished, allow me to encourage Catholics and all Christians to be servants, promoters and defenders of human fraternity here in Morocco. Your Majesty,
Distinguished Authorities,
Dear friends! I thank you and all the Moroccan people once more for your warm welcome and your kind attention. Shukran bi-saf! May the Almighty, Gracious and Merciful, protect you and bless Morocco!
Thank you.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis signed, Saturday at the Throne room of the Rabat Royal Palace, the “Al-Quds Call,” aimed at promoting and enhancing the specific multi-faith character, spiritual dimension and special identity of the holy city. Here follows the full text of this Call, read out in Arabic by secretary general of the Higher Council of Ulema, Mohamed Yessef, and in Italian by Edgar Pena Parra, substitute at Vatican’s secretariat of State. “Call by His Majesty King Mohammed VI and His Holiness Pope Francis concerning Jerusalem / Al-Quds a Holy City and a Meeting Place On the occasion of the Holy Father’s visit to the Kingdom of Morocco, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI, recognizing the uniqueness and the sacred character of Jerusalem  (Al-Quds Al-Sharif), and caring deeply about its spiritual significance, as well as its special vocation as a city of Peace, issued this joint Call: “We believe it is important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) as a shared heritage of humankind and to safeguard it, above all for the believers of the three monotheistic religions, as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and as a meeting place where mutual esteem and dialogue are fostered. To this end, the specific multi-faith character, spiritual dimension and special identity of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) need to be preserved and enhanced. We therefore hope that, in the Holy City, the followers of the three monotheistic religions will be guaranteed free access to religious sites, as well as the right to practice their faith there, so that from Jerusalem (Al-Quds Acharif), the believers may address a prayer to God, the Creator of all beings, for a future of peace and brotherhood on earth.” The ceremony was attended by head of government, Saad Dine El Otmani, the King’s advisors, Omar Azziman, Fouad Ali El Himma and André Azoulay, the minister of the Interior, the minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs and members of the delegation accompanying the Supreme pontiff.

Rabat – As Pope Francis’s arrival in Rabat today marks the second papal visit to Morocco, the event is reminiscent of John Paul II’s visit to the country in 1985—his first to a Muslim country following a direct invitation from its leader. When Pope John Paul II landed at Mohammed VI Airport in Casablanca, he knelt and kissed the Moroccan soil, a humble gesture conveying sentiments of love and tolerance toward the country and its people.  The pontiff was greeted by King Hassan II and King Mohammed VI, who was then Crown Prince.   Pope John Paul II’s visit was an opportunity to lay the foundations of the fraternity, mutual understanding, and interfaith bridge that has become a central pillar in the current pope’s repeated calls for dialogue between Muslims and Christians in Morocco. Pope John Paul II then made a speech in front of thousands of Moroccans at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca. At the time, “Pope John Paul II was concerned about the status of the Church in Morocco and as well as relations with Muslims,” says Vatican News. In his speech, the pope preached and praised the tolerance of Moroccans, but he also warned young Moroccans against extremism and violence.  “Wisdom teaches us that self-discipline and love are the sole levers for the desired renewal [of tolerance],’’ he had said.  John Paul II also visited the Royal Palace in Casablanca where he a military parade greeted him in the welcoming presence of the Moroccan royal family.  King Hassan II and Pope John Paul II met for the first time in Vatican, Rome. The Pope organized a reception in honor of the king who was accompanied by Princess Lalla Hasna, his youngest daughter.   On Saturday, the first day of his two-day stay, Pope Francis began his long-anticipated visit on a rainy day. Like they had done with John Paul II, Moroccans welcomed Pope Francis in an atmosphere of warmth and delight.   The Pope will visit the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V, the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams to meet with Islamic scholars and students, and head to the Caritas migrant center, where he will meet with a group of sub-Saharan migrants with whom he will share messages of hope and peace.  The Pope is also expected to meet with Morocco’s Christian community, including the congregation of Morocco-based bishops.  He will end his visit with a papal Mass on Sunday. The pope’s visit is a celebration of our shared humanity and an invitation to cultivate values of forbearance and togetherness.

Rabat – Head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Education Said Amzazi met on Friday with several associations representing students parents to update them on the government’s measures on the suspension of classes due to the ongoing contractual teachers’ protests. During the meeting, the associations of students parents called on the contractual teachers to resume work. Parents pleaded with the contractual teachers to put students’ interest ahead. El Othmani stressed that he personally follows the issue. He evoked the measures and solutions the government has taken to ensure the normal functioning of schools. Like parents, he noted that, students’ rights should be a top priority of school-related actions. While the protesting teachers have voiced the government’s passivity in meeting their demands for better working conditions, El Othmani explained that the government objectively handled the issue.  He said the government has made the necessary amendments to the government’s program for contractual teachers. The new program is similar to the one used for the permanent teachers employed in the public sector, giving contractual teachers roughly the same rights as their permanently hired peers, according to El Othmani. The head of government expressed dissatisfaction with the teachers’ strike, underlining that no one has the right to stop the functioning of any public service. Weeks-long suspension of classes is unacceptable and unreasonable because it impedes students’ rights, El Othmani argued. The minister of education highlighted the contract program reforms giving contractual teachers the same labor protection as permanent teachers. The pack includes health care, a pension fund, early retirement in case of a permanent sickness, and the right to promotions to posts with greater responsibilities.  Amzazi reassured parents that his ministry has taken the necessary and “practical” measures in cooperation with a number of partners to ensure that the protests do not clash with students’ rights for the rest of the school year. The associations’ representatives appreciated the government initiative to hold a dialogue with them, saluted the authorities’ efforts to address the crisis.

Here follows the full text of the speech: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, This is an exceptional day for two reasons. It is exceptional because of the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis. It is also exceptional because it reminds me of the historical visit the late Pope John Paul II paid to Morocco. Today’s visit falls within the framework of the longstanding relations between Morocco and the Vatican. I was keen to make sure the place and the date of the visit reflect the symbolic depth, the historical significance and the civilizational importance of this Meeting. The place where we are meeting today is an embodiment of openness, passage and cross-cultural fertilization; it is, in itself, a symbol of balance and harmony. Aptly located where the Bouregreg River meets the Atlantic Ocean, this place is aligned with the Al-Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech and with the Giralda in Seville – it constitutes a spiritual, architectural and cultural link between Africa and Europe. I also wanted this visit to coincide with the holy month of Rajab – a month that witnessed one of the most iconic episodes in the history of Islam and Christianity. It was in this month that, at the behest of Prophet Muhammad – may Peace and Blessings be upon Him – Muslims, fleeing persecution, left Mecca to take refuge with the Negus, the Christian King of Abyssinia. This was the first welcoming, during which Islam and Christianity made acquaintance with each other. Today, we are commemorating that act of getting to know each other, for the sake of the future and that of the coming generations. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Holiness’s visit to Morocco is taking place at a time when the Community of Nations – just like that of all Believers – is facing a number of challenges. We need to tackle these new ills which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the Divine Message by advocating the denial of the Other and similar wicked theories. In a world in search of direction, the Kingdom of Morocco has never stopped proclaiming, teaching and experiencing, on a daily basis, Brotherhood among the Sons of Abraham. This is a founding pillar of the exceptionally rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. The symbiotic relationship uniting Moroccans – beyond faiths – is an eloquent example in this regard. This symbiosis is a fact of life in my country. It is reflected by the mosques, churches and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom since time immemorial. As King of Morocco and Commander of the Faithful, I am the Guarantor of the free practice of religion. I am Commander of all believers. And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practise the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom. I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have never ceased to seek God – beyond silence, beyond words and beyond the comfort of dogmas – so that our religions may remain crucial, illuminating bridges, and so that the lessons and messages of the Islamic enlightenment may live on. Given the reality of today’s world, it is clear the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions is insufficient. At a time when paradigms are shifting everywhere and concern all matters, inter-religious dialogue must evolve too. The dialogue centered on tolerance has been going on for a long time now; and yet, it has not achieved its goal. The three Abrahamic religions were not created to be tolerant of one another out of some unavoidable fate, or out of courtesy to one another. The reason they exist is to open up to one another and to know one another, so as to do one another good: “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other (not that you may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you”. The Word of God is Truth. Radicalism – whether it is motivated by religion or not – is due to failure to know one another, to ignorance of the other, and to ignorance pure and simple. Knowing one another eliminates radicalism – all types of radicalism. Knowing one another is precisely what is going to help us rise to the challenges of our tormented times. “To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He has given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues”. The Word of God is Truth. To tackle radicalism, the solution is neither military nor financial; that solution has but one name: Education. My plea for education is an indictment of ignorance. It is binary conceptions and the fact of not knowing one another well enough that are threatening our civilizations; it is certainly not religion. That is why, as Commander of the Faithful, I am advocating today that we give back to religion its rightful place in education. That is why I cannot speak to these young people without warning them against the phenomena of radicalization and of stepping into violence. What all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. Today, religion should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people, for ignorance or for intolerance. That is because religion is Light; religion is Knowledge; religion is Wisdom. And because religion is Peace, it calls for diverting the energy spent on weapons and other misguided races towards loftier pursuits. For this reason, I set up the Mohammed VI Ulema Foundation. I have also responded favorably to requests from several African and European countries to take young people from these nations into the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams and male and female religious guides. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, In my capacity as Commander of the Faithful, I believe, just like the Holy Father, in an active spirituality that seeks to serve the common good. Spirituality is not an end in itself. Our faith translates into concrete actions. It teaches us to love our fellow human beings and to help them. One fact is essential: God forgives. “God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful”. And since God is mercy, generosity and kindness are at the center of my action. Because God is love, I have tried to make sure my reign is characterized by closeness to citizens as well as by assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people. That is the spirit of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) which I launched 14 years ago to improve the lives of people in precarious or fragile situations, integrate those who are excluded, put a roof over the heads of the homeless and kindle faith in a dignified future. That is also the philosophy behind the immigration and asylum policy which I have instituted and which is fundamentally based on solidarity. It is in line with the Marrakech Compact, which the international community adopted on 10 December 2018. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Our meeting attests to a mutually held belief that the values of monotheism contribute to rationalization, to reconciliation and to improving the world order. As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time. I have been following with interest and appreciation Your Holiness’s efforts to serve peace in the world, as well as your regular calls to promote education and dialogue, to end violence, to combat poverty and corruption, to tackle climate change – to fight the ills plaguing human societies. As Commander of the Faithful and as Holy Father, we are called upon to be both idealistic and pragmatic, to be realistic and to set an example. Our messages do not concern our time only; they are eternal. They call upon people to embrace the values of moderation, to fulfil the imperatives of knowing one another and to raise awareness of otherness. By doing this, Your Holiness, you and I “will speak with one voice” – a voice which is not to be reduced to a mere consensus based on compromise. I see this – in my daily life – as a common message conveyed by Muslims, Christians and Jews to all of humankind. That is precisely what has brought us together today and what should unite us in the future. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh”.

By Amina Malik United Kingdom – Nabila Afilal will be returning to her homeland of Morocco to climb Mount Toubkal in hopes of raising awareness about mental health issues. Afilal is currently in the training phase to climb the 4,167-meter-high mountain in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains on May 10. A project manager at a consultancy firm, Afilal will be raising money for BIG in Mental Health, a British charity that aims to provide free mental health help. She believes depression to be an epidemic. The 38-year-old says on her Just Giving page, “I’m doing this enormous challenge as a means not only to push myself generally but I know getting to the top will require me to dig very deep mentally to keep going.  It’s not a comparison by any means of the daily challenges close friends and family have had over the years to even get up out of bed, to shower or to even smile.” Globally, depression is rapidly becoming a debilitating force. The World Health Organization states depression to be the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, due to economic stress and pressures, not everyone can access mental health care. A study titled “Mental Health Care and Human Rights in Morocco,” led by C. Aroui with a team from Hassan II University found an urgent need for mental health institutions in Morocco. Particularly, the study found mental health facilities in rural regions of Morocco to be lacking or totally non-existent. People in rural societies such as the Atlas Mountains, where Afilal will be climbing Mount Toubkal, therefore have few mental health resources. Rural Moroccan populations are just as susceptible to mental health issues as other populations, if not even more so. People who begin to manage their symptoms of depression such as lethargy, pessimism, and mental fatigue tend to subsequently increase productivity. Ultimately, there is a payoff to investing in mental health.  In many ways, investing in mental health is investing in the future. The government health department directs 4 percent of health care expenditures towards mental health. About half (49 percent) of mental health expenditures is for mental hospitals. Only severe mental disorders are covered in social insurance schemes. This method of pathologizing mental health is not only expensive, but it does not attend to the vast majority of Moroccans who could be productive but just need help. Half of the Moroccan population has a mental health issue, and 26 percent suffer from depression. Broad and affordable solutions should be made more readily available. The core aim of therapy is individual empowerment. Although the government can and should make changes, there is much someone who is suffering from a non-life-threatening depression can do. For instance, one easy-to-do yet often overlooked technique is to be aware of one’s internal dialogue throughout the day. Thoughts like, “I am stupid, I’ll never be any good” or “I’ll never find employment” create emotions such as sadness and fear. When these thoughts and feelings are repeated often they become mood disorders such as depression or anxiety. Watching and controlling our thoughts, telling ourselves the opposite of what we fear, “No I will pass the exam next month” for instance, will slowly start elevating our mood and self-esteem. Managing thoughts combined with self-care practices like listening to positive music, writing down feelings in a journal, creating a gratitude list, and eating to nourish the health of the body are all inexpensive ways of improving mood. Far too often, people are susceptible to blaming sihr (black magic), ‘ayn (evil eye), or Hasad (jealousy) for their mental health problems. This puts the responsibility outside of ourselves for change. However, religion teaches the exact opposite: God does not change the condition of those who do not change themselves. The first step to change our condition is to change our thoughts, and this is in our personal control. A cognitive behavioral therapist can help people with depression or anxiety with their thoughts and consequently change negative behaviors. These facilities require a few qualified practitioners and a safe building. Beds, ECT machines, even medication is usually not required for effective treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an affordable option for investment and can be easily distributed throughout Morocco. All that is required is awareness, training, and a genuine willingness to work together for a better tomorrow.

Rabat – Under the cover of surrounding buildings, dozens of people lined the streets of Rabat to welcome Pope Francis to Morocco, whose two-day visit will focus on interfaith dialogue and issues of migration. Rain showered the waving flags of the Vatican City and Morocco during the pope’s drive from the Rabat-Sale Airport to Hassan Tower. The overcast weather led to the cancellation of the pontiff’s parade down Mohammed V Avenue, his official welcome and greeting by King Mohammed VI at the Royal Palace. Instead, King Mohammed VI received the pope at the airport and escorted him to Hassan Tower — a long awaited meeting that was first officially announced in March. The last papal visit was 34 years ago in 1985, when Pope John Paul II was invited to Morocco by the late-King Hassan II with a similar hope of building a bridge between Muslims and Christians. In line with their commitment to interfaith dialogue, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI signed the “Al-Quds Call.” The aim of the document is to promote the holy city of Jerusalem as a shared heritage of humankind. Amid news of political and religious divisiveness surrounding the historic city, the king and the pope said they hope to contribute to its safeguarding as a place for peaceful coexistence. King Mohammed VI introduced the pope by giving an opening speech at Hassan Tower. “Today’s visit falls within the framework of the long-standing relations between Morocco and the Vatican. I was keen to make sure the place and the date of the visit reflect the symbolic depth, the historic significance and the civilizational importance of this meeting,” said King Mohammed VI. After the king’s welcome, the pontiff gave his address to Moroccan authorities gathered at the Hassan Tower complex as hundreds of people in the neighborhood watched the historic event from the streets. Peaceful collaboration between Muslims and Christians is a central element of Pope Francis’ visit and speech. The pontiff has continuously advocated for greater interfaith dialogue throughout his six-year tenure. “I would like to affirm once more our need for cooperation in giving new impetus to the building of a world of greater solidarity, marked by honest, courageous, and indispensable efforts to promote a dialogue respectful of the richness and distinctiveness of each people and every individual,” said Pope Francis during the speech. He also said it was “essential” for all religious believers to respond to religious fanaticism and extremism with solidarity. The pope called religious extremism “an offense against religion and against God himself.” These statements come 15 days after a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which left 50 people dead and at dozens more injured. After his address, the pope paid his respects at the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V before leaving the center of Rabat to visit the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, where he met with Islamic scholars and students. The pope’s day ended at the headquarters of the Caritas migrant center, where he conveyed messages celebrating hope and shared humanity to a group of sub-Saharan migrants. “The church is aware of the sufferings that accompany your journey, and she suffers with you,” Pope Francis said to the migrants. “Every human being has the right to life. Every person has the right to dream and find his or her rightful place in our common home.” Catholic sub-Saharan migrants made up the majority of the people who, waiting outside the Caritas migrant center or packing the vicinity of the Hassan Tower Complex, came in flocks to watch the pope speech. Veronique, a migrant from Cameroon, who declined to give her last name to Morocco World News, hopes the pope’s visit will lead to a brighter future for Christians in Morocco. The 32-year-old is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Christian community in Morocco, which is approximately 2,000 to 5,000 people. “It is a very big moment that the pope is here because we have a lot of difficulty being accepted as Christian immigrants,” Veronique said. “It is important we have the right to pray and practice our religion.” Days before his visit, the pontiff thanked King Mohammed VI for allowing him to use Morocco as a platform to share his “profound convictions” of forgiveness, tolerance, interfaith dialogue, and peace. “As Muslims and Christians, we all believe in one God, the creator and most merciful who created men and established them in a shared world so that they live together as brothers and sisters and help each other in times of need,” said the pope in a video message published by Vatican News. During his address at Hassan Tower the pope again brought up his gratitude to Moroccan society and his hopes for the Christian community in Morocco. “Christians are deeply appreciative of the place accorded them in Moroccan society,” he said. “They wish to do their part in building a fraternal and prosperous nation, out of concern for the common good of its people.” As the pope spoke to the group, fellow Catholics, some of whom had come from Spain to support the pope, waited along with the many sub-Saharan migrants outside the Caritas center.  “The pope is the representative of God on Earth and he always increases and strengthens people’s faith,” said Marissa Lobato, a Spanish Catholic who had so far attended all of the pontiff’s events. “A visit is good because it is a bridge of unity.” Lobato, along with five companions, traveled from Spain to Morocco by ferry to see the pope and show their support for his positive platform on interfaith dialogue and migration. “I don’t know if it will change the lives of Christians in Morocco, but it will help a lot,” said Luis Filio, one of Lobato’s companions. “It will pave the way for understanding between religions.” The six Spanish travelers said they are looking forward to attending Pope Francis’ events tomorrow before taking the ferry home. The pope will begin his second and last day in Morocco in the city of Temara, just southwest of Rabat. There, the pontiff will visit the Rural Center for Social Services. He will then proceed to meet with priests and the Council of Churches in St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rabat, before traveling to the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, where he will host a mass.  The pope will then expect to leave for the Rabat-Sale Airport, where he will have a farewell ceremony before his flight back to Rome. Morocco is the second Arab country the pope has visited in 2019. The pontiff spent three days in the United Arab Emirates from February 3-5. During his UAE stay, Pope Francis reiterated his commitment to themes of inter-religious dialogue and solidarity among different faiths.  According to Vatican News, Pope Francis’s next international visit will be to Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from May 5-7.

Rabat – After Donald Trump’s Mexico wall claims, it is now the turn of Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s first far-right party Vox, to voice his intentions about building a wall at Spanish enclaves Melilla and Ceuta and make Morocco bear the cost of the project. Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s first far-right Vox party, is asking Morocco to pay for a wall he plans to build at Morocco’s border with the Melilla and Ceuta enclaves. He says the project aims at curbing the migrants’ flow. In a book titled “Santiago Abascal: Espana vertebrada” and published earlier this week, writer Fernando Sanchez Drago has published a book this week entitled revealed Abascal’s party immigration policies. The book states that Abascal wants to make Morocco pay for the wall because he sees the North African country as the primary culprit for the waves of irregular migrants that have reached Spain in recent years. According to the book, the party wants the Spanish army to monitor the borders until the construction of the walls is complete. Abascal also wants to introduce new irregular migration measures to prevent NGOs that, according to him, collaborate with Mafias to rescue migrants across the Mediterranean. The Spanish politician believes that “the great wall that we should be building is a psychological one and consists of informing immigrants that those who enter illegally in Europe will never be able to regularize their situation nor will they have the right to stay, nor will they have social assistance, nor will they be given a health card,” according to  Fernando Sanchez Drago’s book.

Rabat  – The National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) in Mehdya near Kenitra arrested on Thursday a night guard who, armed with a sharp weapon, robbed a woman and raped her in front of her baby. The 54-year-old man raped and abused the woman in a construction site he was guarding in Mehdya.  On Thursday night, police received a call from an anonymous person who reported the rape. The guard, the primary suspect was arrested on the same night, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Friday. Police immediately transferred the woman and her baby to a local hospital for emergency care. The baby was apparently not subjected to any form of violence, said DGSN. Police also seized the victims’ bracelet which the man had stolen during the robbery. The suspect is currently in custody pending investigations. Recently, Morocco has witnessed several shocking rape cases that became nationwide topics, including cases of sexual harassment and violence plaguing women. One of the rape cases that made international headlines and fueled the activism of national and international NGOs who was of Khadija, a teenager who was allegedly kidnapped, raped, held in captivity, and forcibly tattooed last summer.  According to an annual report issued by the King’s Attorney General, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi in 2018, there were over 1,600 rape cases reported in 2017 in the country. In hopes to eliminate sexual harassment and gender-based violence, Morocco enacted Law 103-13 in September 2018. But some women’s associations have expressed disappointment with the law.  They say it contains loopholes because some offenders still receive leniency, which,  according to the Union of Women’s Action (UAF), a Moroccan feminist association, will not allow the elimination of the violence that “affects two-thirds of Moroccan women.”

Rabat – The 58-year-old was subject to the international arrest warrant and red notice from the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) for an alleged premeditated murder, kidnapping, and escape from prison.  According to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the man, who goes by the nicknames “El Ruso” and “El Rober,” is linked to a violent criminal network in Spain.  The suspect took advantage of a hospital visit in Madrid to escape from prison on November 1, 2018, with use “violence against civil guards,” said the same source. The suspect managed to enter Morocco with a fake passport before local police in Tetouan identified him. The suspect is currently in custody pending more investigations before extradition to Spain. The investigations and arrest of the suspect are the fruit of a collaboration between Moroccan and Spanish security services.  Morocco and Spain share strong cooperation in countering terrorism and fighting transnational criminal networks. Following with King Felipe VI of Spain’s visit to Morocco in February, the two countries signed an agreement to combat terrorism; track down terrorist financing; fight drug trafficking, human trafficking, arbitrary arrest and detention, property crimes, money laundering, illicit trade of firearms, explosives, and nuclear materials.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, has expressed satisfaction with all government proposals to end the protests of teachers who describe themselves as the “forcibly contractual teachers.”  The contractual teachers, who have been protesting for four weeks in a row, are demanding better civil service benefits offered in the public sector. In response, the government has offered to abolish recruitment of teachers through contracts and hire the teachers as full employees of the regional academies of education. The teachers, however, found the offer unacceptable, arguing that regional academies lack the human and financial resources they need. El Khalfi said that the government has responded to all demands of the teachers as their status changed from being contractual employees to “regional employees.” El Khalfi argued that the aim is to “enable these teachers to be equal to the rest of the national education sector.” In the press conference held after the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi emphasized that the teachers should have reacted “positively” with the government’s measures, “especially as the contract was canceled.” El Khalfi added that the measure offered by the government is “irreversible.” No alternatives “The government did everything it could, and adopted a vision that was implemented gradually but quickly.” He added that the government will deal with the continuous strike by the teachers using measures within the law. “Regional academies will take the necessary measures to ensure the interests of students andto stem classes’ losses. Contractual teachers have been conducting strikes across the country. Said Amzazi, Morocco’s Minister of Education and Vocational Training, has already unveiled the government’s measures to deal with contractual teachers. In a Wednesday joint press conference with El Khalfi, Amzazi said that the government will send teachers warnings of expulsion and will cut their wages if they do not return to their work. Read Also: Moroccan Contractual Teachers Strike for 4th Week for Equality Amzazi said that contractual teachers are hampering their students’ education with their strike and demonstrations. “Despite the serious efforts we have made there is this coordination which incites employees at regional vocational training academies to stop working for the fourth week now. We are questioning, what is the legal status of this coordination? And does it have the legitimacy to lead a strike?” Amzazi asked. It remains to be seen whether the contractual teachers will resume their strikes, or the government’s statement to dismiss them for their absence will convince them to go back to work.

Rabat – As Morocco awaits Pope Francis’s highly anticipated weekend visit, March 30-31, sixty Christian migrants in Rabat are preparing to greet him. Pope Francis’s visit will be the second papal visit to Morocco, the first since 1985. The Vatican announced in January that the motto of the visit would be “hope,” and Moroccan bishops later clarified that the visit would revolve around interfaith dialogue and issues of migration, themes that the pope has pressed throughout his six-year tenure. But for Christian migrants who have sought aid from the Caritas Morocco center in Rabat, the significance of the visit will be felt on a more personal footing. The pope plans to spend an hour with them at the organization’s headquarters on Saturday.  Caritas is a collective of Catholic social service and relief organizations that operate in over 160 countries. Like other branches of Caritas, the organization’s Moroccan arm does diverse work—everything from agro-ecological projects to working with disabled individuals.  Migration, though, is a major focus for Caritas Morocco, and the primary reason for the pope’s visit. Caritas Morocco director Hannes Stegemann said in an interview with Morocco World News that he hopes the visit will bring attention to realities of migration in Morocco. The organization has worked with sub-Saharan African migrants in need since the early 2000s.  But the situation has intensified in recent years, and migrants are arriving in greater need. Caritas Morocco has assisted around 45,000 migrants since it began its work on migration nearly two decades ago, according to Stegemann. Now the organization, which also has branches in Tangier and Casablanca, works with 8,000 people annually. Over the past five years, though, migration in Morocco has transformed. More and more women with children and unaccompanied minors are arriving in Morocco to find opportunities—and coming to Caritas for support. “The profile of the migrants has changed drastically,” Stegemann said. “I think the migrant community realized that for the classical migrant, who is male and looking for work, the doors are closed.” Caritas, once accustomed to working with young men seeking employment, has been overwhelmed by the needs of the migrants that knock on its doors. Unaccompanied minors make up around 25 percent, Stegemann said. Their top countries of origin are Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Cameroon. Caritas provides a wide range of services to the migrants that come to their door. Depending on the needs of the person, that might be legal help, psychological support, or just a hot meal. Women and children, though, tend to need more long-term assistance. Caritas has seen women through pregnancies, prevented family separations, and tracked down relatives of children abroad. They rent apartments for two dozen minors who migrated, unaccompanied, to Morocco. “[It]’s a problem because it’s far more complicated far more expensive and, in terms of time, very time-consuming to accommodate these groups,” Stegemann said. “The need is high.” Caritas has persisted, though, he said, and is constantly adapting its strategy to the situation. “It’s learning by doing.” The high majority of the migrants Caritas serves are Christian, although the center does not discriminate on the basis of religion. It’s self-selecting, Stegemann explained; Caritas is a Catholic organization, and Christian migrants tend to require greater support integrating into Moroccan society. (People of sub-Saharan descent make up most Christians in Morocco.) And Caritas, itself, is a diverse mission. A third of its staff are sub-Saharan migrants, primarily Christian; another third are Moroccan; and a final third are European volunteers. It’s a prime example of the kind of interfaith cooperation that both Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI have lauded. Stegemann emphasized, too, that Caritas is just one part of the larger story of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco. “The migrant looking for assistance with Caritas is a migrant with problems,” he said—not one of the many migrants who have successfully integrated into Moroccan society. For these people, Pope Francis’s visit on Saturday may offer needed recognition and hope.

Rabat – The African Development Bank (AfDB) has once again approved a loan budget of over 400 million to back Morocco’s industrialization program. According to state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the loan will help finance projects initiated by small and medium-sized enterprises. AfDB’s manager in Morocco Leila Farah Mokaddem said, “This operation will help improve Morocco’s industrial competitiveness and strengthen its integration into African and global value chains.” The Moroccan Ambassador to Cote d’Ivoire Abdelmalek Kettani and the AFDB Vice President in charge of the regional development, regional integration and service delivery, Khaled Sherif, signed the loan agreement. MAP reported that the program aims to promote industrial acceleration in Morocco through the mobilization of industrial ecosystems, improving the competitiveness of operators in the sector and the financing of first-rate industrial economic activities. Mixed reception Although the loans granted to Morocco seek to contribute to its socio-economic development, several senior officials have warned against the issue of external debt and its influence on the country’s economic performance. The 2019 Global Firepower Index (GFP) found that Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt. Prior to this loan, several other international firms granted financial contribution to Morocco to carry out socio-economic projects. Earlier this month, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted Morocco an €80 million loan to contribute to enlarging the Casablanca highway. Several Moroccan officials warned against external debt. In January, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami said that Morocco’s economy will be weighed down by debt in 2019. The commissioner also warned that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of the GDP by the end of 2019, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018.

Rabat – Morocco’s berry exports increased remarkably from 66,332 tons in 2010-2011 to 115,442 tons in 2017-2018, announced the Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries, Aziz Akhannounch, at the National Festival of Berries in Kenitra. Morocco exported on average 60 to 70 percent of the total production of strawberries, 90 to 95 percent of raspberries, and more than 95 percent of blueberries, with the region of El Gharb, Loukkos and Souss Massa representing the three main areas red fruits are cultivated the most. The European Union demands red fruits from Morocco the most, with 90 percent of Morocco’s  total production going to EU countries, five percent to Asia, 1.5 percent to the Gulf countries, and 4.5 percent for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Africa, South America, Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), and Oceania. Akhannounch told Maghreb Arab Press Agency (MAP) that Morocco’s Green Plan has invested heavily in value-added agricultural value chains, noting that production and exports have increased by more than 85 percent. He also said that in 2018 the export volume increased by 48 percent compared to 2017, generating MAD 5 billion compared to MAD 2 billion. Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Regional Director of Agriculture Aziz Bellouti said that the festival comes in recognition of the region’s agricultural potential, particularly with the respect to the quality of the land and the abundance of water. On the sidelines of the festival, Akhannounch, Larache governor Bouassam El Alamine, and Australia’s Ambassador to Morocco, Berenice Owen-Jones visited Africa’s largest blueberries packaging station in Larache, which became operational two weeks ago. The station, which is 90 percent owned by Australian group Costa and 10 percent by the English group World Berry, is equipped with a blueberry packaging unit with a capacity of 100 tons per day and a refrigeration unit of 8,100 cubic meters.

Rabat – The weekly government council approved a draft decree against violence on Thursday on the elimination of sexual harassment and gender-based violence. The draft decree 2.18.856—presented by Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development Basima Hakkaoui—aims to implement the provisions of Articles 10, 11, 3, 15 of Law 103.13 enacted in September 2018. The aforementioned articles support female victims of violence through a number of mechanisms like cells and sectors-joint committees. Article 10 dictates that “cells of support for women victims of violence shall be established within courts of the first instance, courts of appeal, central and decentralized services of the sectors in charge of justice, health, youth and women, the General Directorate of National Security and within the High Command of Royal Gendarmerie.” Such cells will provide services such as reception, counseling, accompaniment, and other forms of support for female victims of violence. Article 11 requires the establishment of a national committee for support of women victims of violence. “The National Committee shall meet at least once a year, or whenever necessary upon invitation by the president or the majority of its members.” Article 12 stipulates the mission and tasks of the National Committee referred to in Articles 13, 14 and 15. The tasks range from ensuring communication and national coordination between government sectors and central administrations concerned with violence against women, to “giving its opinion regarding the action plans adopted by the regional and local committees.” The regional and local committees should determine the constraints and obstacles hampering the process of support provided for women, and propose appropriate solutions for them. The committee works are open for any person interested in women’s affairs, any representative of institution or association “which the committee sees useful to invite,” reads Article 15. During the meeting presided by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi and Hakkaoui enhanced the progress and achievements of the government’s equality initiative, “Ikram.” The “Ikram 2” 2018-2021, which follows the Ikram 1 plan, seeks to combat violence against women and ensure equality between men and women on economic, social, and political levels.  The “Ikram 1” 2012-2016 was dedicated to monitoring the National Observatory on Violence Against Women, a national campaign against domestic violence, in addition to the National Observatory for Improvement of Women’s Image in the Moroccan media. El Khalfi added that the government is also taking measures to implement the national strategy for 2018-2030 to combat violence against women. As for partnerships with civil society, El Khalfi affirmed that the government will finance women’s support centers throughout the next three years. The government allocated MAD 72 million (over $2.7 million) to 223 support centers for women between 2012 and 2017 to improve services, said El Khalfi. Women’s associations in Morocco have identified loopholes in Law 103.13 and recently expressed disappointment. On International Women’s Day, March 8, a Moroccan feminist association, the Union of Women’s Action (UAF), released a statement drawing attention to Moroccan women’s struggle with sexism, gender-based violence, marginalization, vulnerability to poverty, and lack of enforcement of their legal rights. In its statement, UAF said that “ the promulgation of Law 103-13 fighting violence against women has been a great disappointment due to its inability to protect against [violence], prevent it, and end impunity.” Because some offenders receive leniency, said UAF, the law will not allow the elimination of the violence “which affects two-thirds of Moroccan women.” The association also rued the fact that Morocco ranked among countries with a large gender gap—137th of 149 world countries. The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2019 report published on February 27 ranked Morocco third of Middle Eastern and North African countries in terms of gender equality in law and business.

Rabat – The National Ports Agency has said in a statement that the coal traffic increased by 28.9 percent, reaching 8.9 million tons in 2018, against 6.9 million tons in 2017.  Container traffic also increased by 1.6 percent, up from 11.9 million tons in 2017 to 12.1 million tons in 2018. Hydrocarbon traffic decreased by nearly 8 percent, down from 11.2 million tons in 2017 to 10.3 million tons in 2018. Morocco’s ports turnover slightly increased from MAD 1.74 billion in 2017 to MAD 1.78 billion in 2018. Operating expenses increased by 7.3 percent, reaching MAD 1.67 billion in income. The positive turnover is said to be due to three elements. One reason was an increase of MAD 34.5 million in study and service purchases. Part of that money served to upgrade certain port infrastructures and improve the quality of services.  The maintenance of port infrastructures for an amount of MAD 38.8 million and the implementation of investment projects resulting in amortization of MAD 31.6 million also contributed to the industry’s improved performance. The operating income decreased by 8.8 percent to MAD 227.3 million, while net income slightly increased from MAD 144.7 million in 2017 to MAD 147.1 million in 2018, up by 1.6%.

Rabat – On the sixth Friday since the start of anti-Bouteflika demonstrations in Algeria, tens of thousands of Algerians took to the street calling for both the president and his political “gang” to leave.  Days after Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s long-time ally, National Army senior officer Gaid Salah proposed the president’s removal through the Algerian Constitution, the people marched today to condemn the army’s intervention in the civil and political life. Chanting freedom slogans and carrying Algerian flags, the Algerian people reiterated their rejection of Bouteflika and his plans. They called for his entire political elite to step down, while also questioning the intentions of the army veteran, Gaid Salah. Algerians are demanding a drastic change in their country’s political system, evidencing growing distrust of the country’s independence war veterans.   Marchers said the country wants a ruler who can communicate with Algerians, deal with increasing socio-economic issues.  “We have only one word to say today, all the gang must go immediately, game over … the people want the fall of the regime,” an Algerian merchant told Reuters during protests on Friday, March 29—the sixth Friday since February 22. “Street pressure will continue until the system goes,” said another protester. Meanwhile, the ailing president Bouteflika has lost some of his strongest allies in the past few days. Powerful military chief Gaid Salah said on Tuesday that the solution to Algeria’s “crisis” is in the Algerian Constitution’s Article 102 which allows for the removal of an incapacitated president. On the other hand, journalist Hafid Derradji criticized Salah’s statement, calling it “circumentive,” and said that the “army should stay out of politics.”  “[Salah’s] intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of the temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” said the beIN SPORTS journalist. Bouteflika’s ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), supported Salah’s proposal, describing it as “a start to a constitutional plan that will allow us to protect our country from dangers.” The party has also rejected Bouteflika’s idea to hold a national conference which, saying that it is no longer a “valid” one. Another close ally who turned against Bouteflika is the former Algerian prime minister Ahmed Ouyahia, leader of Algeria’s National Rally for Democracy (RND) party. In a Tuesday message, Ouyahia urged Bouteflika to resign. Seddik Chihab, a spokesman for RND, which is in coalition with the FLN, took a scathing jab at Bouteflika’s administration in a statement on Wednesday. He described the regime  as a “cancer.” Although Bouteflika withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term, he announced his plan to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before electoral designation of a  successor.  By delaying the April 18 elections, Bouteflika effectively extended his fourth term indefinitely.

Rabat – Amid apparent icy relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Morocco’s foreign minister has again commented on diplomatic ties with its Gulf allies, urging reciprocity to salvage the damaged relations. Speaking on Thursday at a joint conference with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi, the Moroccan minister seized the opportunity to address the much-reported fallout with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Amid rumors of alleged friction, Bourita said that from “the point of view of Morocco, relations with Gulf countries,” especially Saudi Arabia and UAE, “have always been deep historical relations.” Morocco, he added, has always been keen to preserve and strengthen its diplomatic ties with the two Gulf countries. Read Also: Saudi Arabia, Morocco Emphasize ‘Historic’ Ties amid Alleged Friction “It may happen that we do not agree on certain issues. Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” said Bourita. According to the Moroccan official, maintaining cooperation should be a joint effort and a matter of reciprocal loyalty on important issues. He added that preserving the diplomatic ties should “be a concern on both sides, and if not, it would be normal for all alternatives to be examined.” In MENA regional crises like the situations in Libya and Syria, the Moroccan minister suggested, commitment to principles such as reciprocity should be the driving force of action. Bourita’s recent statement differ from previous remarks he made when asked about alleged friction between Rabat and Riyadh. Denying the reported spat, Bourita said in February that Morocco enjoys strong and historic diplomatic ties with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The rumors resulted from a documentary aired by a pro-government Saudi television channel against Morocco’s position in the regional conflict over Western Sahara. Following the broadcast of the controversial documentary, international news outlets reported that Morocco recalled its ambassadors from both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Bourita, however, denied the news, emphasizing that such decisions to recall ambassadors would be announced through its own special channels. Prior to Bourita’s latest statement, King Salman of Saudi Arabia called King Mohammed VI and requested Morocco to “review their brotherly relationship.” The latest comments on Morocco’s relations with Riyadh’s and Abu Dhabi suggest that officials may have taken into account the collective mood in Moroccan circles when reacting to perceived provocations from the two Gulf countries. While Moroccan officials remained silent in the first days of growing concern over some of Saudi Arabia’s actions towards Morocco, including the controversial Western Sahara documentary, Moroccans in chorus called for a strategic shift in Morocco’s stance vis-à-vis Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. They demanded reciprocity from the two kingdoms, arguing that Morocco did not owe loyalty to partners that fail to take its security and sovereignty seriously.

Rabat – During a joint press conference with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita on Thursday, Jordan’s foreign minister Aymane Safadi said that “Jordan has a consistent position on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara.” He added that his country “totally and absolutely supports the territorial integrity of the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco. The official also emphasized the importance of reaching an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1813, and within the framework of the Moroccan autonomy initiative. This is not the first time that Jordan has backed Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. In October 2018, the Jordanian foreign ministry emphasized the need to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict on the basis of the autonomy plan. Safadi said that his country will remain committed to its traditional “total and absolute support” for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Safadi’s recent statement falls within the context of a growing impetus to bolster regional cooperation on critical policy matters. In recent years, both Morocco and Jordan have expressed their determination to reinforce diplomatic ties, paving the way for more cooperation in several sectors. Safadi was among the Jordanian delegation which accompanied King Abdullah II of Jordan during his official trip to Morocco from March 27-28. King Abdullah left Morocco on Thursday after a busy agenda, including numerous audiences with King Mohammed VI. In their many discussions, the two Kings stressed the need for greater bilateral connections. The monarchs discussed several topics, including issues hindering the development of the Middle East like the Syrian and Palestinian crisis.  They called for more collective efforts to secure stability in Syria, while also reiterating their commitment to Palestine’s struggle for rights and self-determination.

Rabat – While Morocco recognizes the freedom of religious practice in its constitution, Christians dot not enjoy the same religious freedoms as Muslims, reports have suggested. Pope Francis’ official visit to Morocco from March 30-31 highlights the situation of Christians in Morocco, as Christian Moroccans have been vocal about their faith, especially on social media. A number of Moroccan Christians are taking the papal visit as an opportunity to raise issues of religious practice violations in Morocco. The number of Christians in Morocco has been decreasing since Morocco gained independence in 1956. Back then, the estimated number of Catholic Christians stood at nearly 300,000. Morocco was also home to more than 200 Catholic churches. Currently, there are 44 formal churches in Morocco, manned by 57 priests and pastors. The Catholic churches are administered by bishops in Rabat and Tangier. In the US government’s 2017 International Religious Freedom report, Christian leaders estimated there is 2,000 to 6,000 Christian citizens in Morocco. Another report by the NGO Aid to the Church in Need put the overall number as high as 40,000. The French arm of the Dutch Open Doors NGO put the number at 32,000 and claimed that Moroccan Christians have to practice their religion in secrecy. They cannot practice their faith in the open for fear of legal proceedings. By exposing their faith, Moroccan Christians might run the risk of being jailed for 6 months to 3 years in prison and a fine of MAD 200 to 500 ($21 to $53) under the pretext of proselytizing and shaking the faith of Muslims, prohibited in Article 220 of the Moroccan penal code, according to some Christian association representatives. Unlike many countries in Africa, however, Morocco does not impose the death penalty for apostasy under the penal code. However, the High Authority of Ulema, the most important religious authority in Morocco, issued a fatwa (religious edict) in 2013 stating that apostasy is punishable by death. While most Christians in Morocco are foreigners, there is a community of Moroccan Christians. There are an estimated 8,000 Moroccans who have converted to Christianity, most of whom are Protestant, according to the Observatory for Religious Freedom. Overall, however, there are more Catholics than Protestants in Morocco.  Constitutionally, Morocco recognizes Islam as its official state religion and Judaism as a native religion in Morocco, while guaranteeing freedom of religious practice to others. Foreign Christians enjoy full freedom to practice their faith under legal protection, although they do not enjoy the same legal status as people of Jewish faith. An AFP report indicates that some churches have allegedly been turned into mosques since independence, and others have fallen into disrepair. Reports estimate that over ninety percent of the Christians living in Morocco come from sub-Saharan Africa. That includes students on scholarships pursuing their studies in Morocco and migrants transiting from Morocco to Europe. In early 2019, a court in Taza, a city in northern Morocco, ruled in favor of a Christian man accused of “shaking the faith of a Muslim.”

Rabat – A senior Emirati official has slammed the traditional non-negotiation and principled Arab unity around the Palestinian cause, saying that a two-state solution is no longer feasible and Arab countries should change their approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s Foreign Affairs Minister, said in an interview with Emirati newspaper the National that it was “a very wrong decision” for Arab countries not to have normal diplomatic relations with Israel.  Despite a flurry of regional divisions on many issues, support to the Palestinian cause has remained perhaps the single steadfast rallying cry for MENA governments, with Arab countries traditionally saying that Palestinian’s rights to return should be the first condition of diplomatic normalization with Israel. Gargash, however, sees boycotting Israel as ineffective and counterproductive. He said Arab countries need a “strategic shift” in their relations with Israel if they are to expect a realistic end to the Israel-Palestine issue. “Many, many years ago, when there was an Arab decision not to have contact with Israel, that was a very, very wrong decision, looking back,” he said.  Gargash added that a more pragmatic and effective approach to ending the conflict would entail warmer relations with Israel. “Because clearly, you have to really dissect and divide between having a political issue and keeping your lines of communication open.” Two-state solution not feasible In recent months, US President Trump’s unapologetically pro-Israel moves in the Middle East, including the 2017 move to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the most recent controversial statements on the Golan Heights, elicited unanimous condemnations from MENA countries. In the Arab world, the condemnation of the US shift to an openly pro-Israel line was mostly due to the dismay at having Jerusalem stripped of parts of its Arab and Muslim identity. Arab leaders then called for the two-state solution, reiterating their commitment to the Palestinians’ struggle. According to Gargash, however, it is unrealistic to want Israel to return to the 1967 peace terms. Instead, he argued, pro-Palestinian voices should let go of the two-state solution and rather push for closer ties with Israel to broker peace based on new criteria. “A two-state solution will no longer be feasible because a sort of reduced rump state will no longer be practical,” the UAE minister said, adding, “What we are facing, if we continue on the current trajectory, I think the conversation in 15 years’ time will really be about equal rights in one state.” Gargash’s remarks come in the backdrop of reports that Israel and a number of Arab countries have been engaged in intensive behind-the-curtain negotiations to gradually establish official diplomatic lines of communication. While many of the concerned countries, including Morocco, have denied the reports, the Emirati official’s statements are bound to rekindle debates about Israel-Arab normalization. Meanwhile, as he campaigns for re-election in upcoming elections on April 8, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant about his Jewish nationalism-flavored stance on Palestine and other policy matters. “In the face of all pressure, I will always protect our country,” Netanyahu recently said, according to Reuters.  Like Gargash, the Israeli Prime Minister has maintained on numerous occasions in past statements that the two-state solution “is not going to happen.”

Rabat – After a flurry of controversies regarding the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the legitimacy of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, world leaders are reacting with outcry, condemnation, and anger. On Monday, March 25, US President Donald Trump officially recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory. Sunday, at an event in Washington, D.C., Prime Minister Viorica Dancila of Romania recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Washington, D.C., Dancila stated that Romania would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “I am pleased to announce today to the AIPAC audience that after the conclusion of the analysis by all the constitutional actors involved in the decision-making process in my country and, in full consensus, I as the Prime Minister of Romania and the Government that I lead, to move the Romanian Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel,” Dancila announced. If Romania moves its embassy, it would make Romania the first European country to do so and would contradict the EU’s consensus that the status of Jerusalem should be determined through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Romanian Senate President Calin Popescu-Tariceanu was previously invited by the Moroccan Speaker of the House of Councillors Hakim Benchamach to Morocco from March 27 to 31. However, after the comments made by the Romanian prime minister regarding Jerusalem, Moroccan officials transmitted via diplomatic channels that they would no longer be available for meetings. According to the Romanian Senate, Popescu-Tariceanu’s official visit to Morocco was postponed at the request of the Moroccan side of the arrangement. Popescu-Tariceanu was set to meet with leaders in the Moroccan Parliament, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, and foreign minister Nasser Bourita. Shortly after the prime minister’s comments, Jordan’s King Abdullah II canceled a visit scheduled for Monday to Romania. The Royal Hashemite Court attributed the decision to “solidarity with Jerusalem.” Jordan is the custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem’s Old City. In reaction to the criticism, Dancila backtracked her statement, calling it “a personal opinion.” Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, criticized Dancila’s comment, stating it was “ruining relations with the region.” He said Romania’s ties with Arab countries were one of “few constants of Romania’s foreign policy.” On Monday, US President Donald Trump officially recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The US is the first country to do so, and it reverses a US policy which has been in place for more than a half-century. Trump said the decision would allow Israel to defend itself from regional threats. The decision also boosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly before the upcoming Israeli elections on April 9. Israel captured the land from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel later annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move the United Nations condemned. Israel argues the strategic plateau is necessary to protect itself from Iran and Iranian allies in Syria. In a December 1981 resolution, the United Nations Security Council recognized Israel as “the occupying power”of the controversial region and said Israel’s desire to “impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.” This week, the UN reaffirmed the resolution, stating that the current Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues to adhere to the council’s resolutions. ידידי הנשיא טראמפ חתם על צו המכיר בריבונות ישראל ברמת הגולן. יום היסטורי למדינת ישראל! My friend President Trump signed an order recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights. A historic day for Israel! pic.twitter.com/dVAadIDxTH — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) March 25, 2019 
Outcry from the Middle East Shortly after President Trump’s announcement, leaders around the Middle East condemned and criticized the decision. The Syrian government called the decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty a “slap” to the international community and said it makes Washington “the main enemy” of Arabs. The Syrian foreign ministry also called the move a “blatant aggression” on its own sovereignty and said it represents the “highest level of contempt for international legitimacy.” On Tuesday, after calls from the leader of Hezbollah for “resistance,” thousands of Syrians protested in various cities around Syria against Trump’s decision. Saudi state news agency SPA stated that Trump’s recognition “will have significant negative effects on the peace process in the Middle East and the security and stability of the region.” The statement also called the decision a violation of the United Nations Charter and of international law. Lebanon’s foreign ministry recognizes the Golan Heights as “Syrian Arab” territory and said “no country can falsify history by transferring” land from one country to another. In accordance, Lebanese President Michel Aoun also stated the decision “causes particular concern in the countries neighboring Israel.” Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described the US to have “ignored international law.” The US has once again ignored international law. However, this decision will never legitimize Israeli occupation. On the contrary, it will further increase tensions in the region by preventing peace efforts in the Middle East. — Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (@MevlutCavusoglu) March 25, 2019  The Canadian foreign ministry reacted to the decision by releasing a condemning statement. “In accordance with international law, Canada does not recognize permanent Israeli control over the Golan Heights. Canada’s long-standing position remains unchanged.” Five ambassadors to the UN Security Council, from France, Germany, the UK, Poland, and Belgium, released a joint statement on the matter. “Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law,” and any unilateral border changes go against “the rules-based international order and the U.N. Charter,” read the statement published by the close US allies. “We raise our strong concerns about broader consequences of recognizing illegal annexation and also about the broader regional consequences.” The international human rights organization Amnesty International called the move “irresponsible, reckless and yet another example of the Trump administration violating international law and consensus by condoning Israel’s illegal annexation.” With Israeli elections approaching, the decision is likely to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election on April 9. However, the decision also sets a precedent that a country such as the US can ignore a UN Security Council resolution.

Rabat – As hours dwindle before the historic visit to Morocco of Pope Francis, March 30-31, Morocco has engaged in an intensive public relations campaign to broadcast its uniqueness and singularity in the Muslim world. The singularity, Moroccan officials have maintained over the past weeks, resides in that Morocco has a history of peaceful cohabitation with believers of other faiths, mostly Jews and Christians.  Morocco, a land of dialogue In statements from the Moroccan government regarding the schedule and the “historic significance” of the pope’s visit to Morocco, the consensus seems to be that Pope Francis’s choice of Morocco as a destination in his January-launched world tour does have a meaning.  Beyond the mere symbolism of the pontiff’s physical presence in Morocco, speaking side by side with King Mohammed VI on themes of peace, togetherness, and “celebration of our shared humanity,” the chorus among Moroccan officials has been that “Morocco truly is a land of dialogue and tolerance.” Central in the papal visit is Pope Francis’s insistence that “dialogue between Christians and Muslims will have a significant bearing on world peace,” according to a March 27 report from Morocco’s state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). MAP’s report, an interview with Khaled Akcha, a member of the Vatican-based Pontifical Committee on Interfaith-dialogue, where he is responsible for dialogue with Muslims, highlighted the meaning of the pope’s visit to the North African country, again putting it in the context of Morocco’s steadfast efforts in recent years to institutionalize diversity and tolerance. Read Also: King Mohammed VI Congratulates Pope Francis on 6th Year of Pontificate “The pope’s visit to Morocco is part of his desire to bolster dialogue between Christians and Muslims and strengthen world peace,” Akcha told MAP.  But beyond the significance that the visit may have on the global stage, that the pope chose Morocco also tells a lot about the country’s image and reputation, Akcha went on to argue. Morocco, he stressed, “has had, and has excellent ties with the Vatican.” The excellence of Morocco-Vatican relations, if Akcha were to be believed, is owed to Morocco’s “history of secular openness.”  A history of openness Having been the cradle of some of the world’s oldest universities where people came to study from surrounding Muslim and non-Muslim kingdoms, the country has long boasted a “reputation of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the concert of nations.” In May 2018, representatives from nearly 100 countries convened in Marrakech to discuss tolerance and celebration of diversity in a world of increasing hostility to migrants and people thought to be threats to the social fabric of societies where they live and work.  At the end of the meeting, they issued what they called the “Marrakech Declaration.” This, they said, was to propel Morocco, and the world with it, into an age where all countries will treat their citizens on the same footing, regardless of religion, gender, or race. While Morocco cannot be said to have achieved all points addressed in the Marrakech Declaration, it has done a lot in recent years to deserve much of the praise that has come its way as a diversity-friendly country, MAP’s interview suggested. In another report on the meaning of Pope Francis’s Moroccan visit, MAP gave a history-saturated list of reasons why Morocco is a sound choice for a papal visit. Morocco focuses on peace, dialogue, and openness to difference in a world of resurging claims of identity.  Reprising many of the arguments from earlier government statements, MAP’s report argued that the pope’s visit is a “consecration of Morocco’s cultural and civilizational singularity” as a historical land of intercultural relations. MAP wrote: “Throughout its history, and this is true in modern-day Morocco, the kingdom has always been a land of peaceful coexistence, encounters, tolerance, and interactions between Muslims and followers of other faiths, particularly Christians and Jews.” The report argued that Pope Francis’s visit should be read in that context of Morocco’s “secular heritage” of trans-cultural and trans-religious dialogues.  Evoking the 2011 Constitution, MAP went on to heap lavish praise on Morocco’s “genuine efforts” to go down a path of good governance where citizens, no matter which religion or political ideology they espouse, are treated like countrymen of equal religious and political worth. After all, MAP argued, Morocco rose above one of modern history’s darkest hours when it stood up “to France Vichy regime by refusing to hand over Moroccan Jews” and a number of Jews who made it to Morocco while fleeing from Nazi persecution in Europe.  “Morocco was also Pope John Paul II’s choice for his first visit in the Muslim world,” the article reminded readers. Not a bed of roses But the government and Moroccan newspapers have not been the only participants in the mass of “celebrating Morocco’s history of tolerance.” For its laudable reforms and actions to be seen as perhaps the entire MENA region’s strongest bastion of religious tolerance, Morocco’s legal tradition has not been particularly welcoming of the country’s minority of Christian converts, according to a recent Reuters report. “We want laws that protect religious minorities in the country on an equal footing. We will seize the pope’s visit to put more pressure on the state to protect religious freedoms,” one leader of an association of Moroccan converts told Reuters.  While acknowledging Morocco’s religious reforms, especially its efforts to market itself as “an oasis of religious tolerance in a region torn by [Islamist] militancy,” the newspapers spoke of the grievances of Morocco’s existing but largely invisible community of Moroccan Christians. “Moroccan converts say they are forced to worship at home, in secret,” the Reuters report noted. It added, “Conversion from Islam to Christianity is banned – as it is in many Muslim countries – and proselytizing is punishable by up to three years in prison.” In response, the Moroccan government denied the degree of gravity highlighted in the complaints of Moroccan Christians. According to the government, everyone in Morocco is free to practice their religion.  What the country’s laws forbid, however, the government has insisted, is proselytism. Outside of the spaces—mosques and religious schools—allocated for religious discourse, even Muslims are barred from engaging in proselytizing activities, the government has maintained. While it is unclear whether the reported suffering and legal problems of Moroccan Christians has links with their engagement in proselytism, the government’s denial is buttressed by a number of recent actions against what it perceived as “Islamist proselytization.”  In an unprecedented series of raids in February, the Moroccan government cracked down on Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane, one of the country’s most revered Islamist organizations. Dozens of the Islamist fraternity’s villas and meeting halls were closed, with the movement’s leaders also complaining about the “retreat of religious freedoms” in the country. Such occurrences led some to ask about the truthfulness of Morocco’s tolerance rhetoric. How tolerant is Morocco? Does the government’s gospel of religious tolerance and openness to diversity belie its actions on the ground against religious practices that do not embrace the government’s preferred line of religious experience?  “There is no persecution in Morocco and there is no discrimination on the basis of faith,” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said.

Rabat – Prior to his much-publicized visit to Morocco March 30-31, Pope Francis has sent a message of gratitude and peace to King Mohammed VI and Morocco. In a two-minute video published by Vatican News, the pontiff thanked the King for allowing him to use his country as a platform to preach the messages of mutual understanding, tolerance, forgiveness, and interfaith dialogue that have come to define the pope’s tenure as the highest authority of the Catholic church. “Assalamou Alaykoum dear people of the Kingdom of Morocco,” the pope said, starting off with the traditional Moroccan and Islamic greeting. The message continued, addressing Moroccans and their King: “I will soon pay a two-day visit to your country. I praise the Lord for the opportunity that he is offering me. I am also thankful towards His Majesty King Mohammed VI for his caring invitation and the generous collaboration of Moroccan officials.”  In line with his usual message of dialogue and togetherness between world religions, Pope Francis underlined the critical importance of rapprochement between Islam and Christianity for the future of world peace. As the two major and most expanding religions, Pope Francis suggested, Islam and Christianity have an even greater role to play in the world today in the face of people using the two religions for their own political and ideological ends. “As Muslims and Christians, we all believe in one God, the creator and most merciful who created men and established them in a shared world so that they live together as brothers and sisters and help each other in times of need.” Condemning what he perceives as the political instrumentalization of religions, the pope said that the purpose of all religions is to bear witness to God’s design when he created human beings: Embracing diversity and “responsibly preserving the earth for future generations.” Pope Francis said, “I will be more than happy to directly share with you these profound convictions of mine.” Read Also: King Mohammed VI Congratulates Pope Francis on 6th Year of Pontificate During his visit, Pope Francis will meet with Morocco’s Christian community. A fervent defender of migrants’ rights, the pontiff will also spare some of his time for Morocco’s migrant community. To them, too, Pope Francis said he will convey “encouraging messages” of peace and togetherness. “Dear Moroccan friends, I sincerely thank you for your hospitality and your prayers, reiterating my own prayers for you and your beloved country. See you soon,” the message concluded.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan met on Thursday at the Royal Palace in Casablanca to discuss wide-ranging issues driving politics in the Middle East.  In their discussion, the two leaders’ agreed to strengthen the Moroccan-Jordanian diplomatic ties. They also stressed the importance of collective actions to face some of the most high-priority issues of the region. In a subsequent show of the two kingdoms’ commitment to the principles discussed in the monarchs’ meeting, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita joined Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi in releasing a press statement that reiterated the two Kings’ insistence on greater regional dialogue to solve crises.  The press release said that the two countries will collaborate on several sectors, including energy, agriculture, and tourism. The statement also announced that a delegation from Morocco’s General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and the Moroccan Professional Group of Banks (GPBM) will visit Jordan to explore investment opportunities. King Mohammed VI also ordered the establishment of a training center in the fields of tourism, agro-Industry, construction-public works, energy, and water resources in Jordan. The move is aimed at easing expertise sharing and expanding trade ties between the two kingdoms.   Read Also: Jordanian King Abdullah II Cancels Romania Trip to Visit Morocco Unwavering support to the Palestinian people  In addition to the business cooperation, the Palestinian cause was at the heart of the topics discussed between the two sovereigns. King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan reiterated their full support to the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Both monarchs condemned Israel’s growing worrying policies  in Jerusalem. They said Israeli authorities are undermining the city’s ’s legal and historical status, as well as its demographic and spiritual make-up.  They said that Palestinians’ right to return to Israeli-occupied territories and their struggle for equal and dignified treatment as citizens should remain a rallying cry for governments of the MENA region.   King Abdullah II commended the continued efforts of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of Al-Quds Committee, in favor of Jerusalem and the Palestinian people. Prior to his visit to Morocco, King Abdullah II canceled a state visit to Romania, protestating the southeastern European country’s recently announced stance on the status of Jerusalem . On Sunday, March 24, Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila her country would soon move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move stirred controversy in the international community, especially in the Muslim World, where the Palestinian cause is a cause celebre. For many governments in the region, including Morocco, support for Palestine is a high-priority policy. In response to Romania’s prospective Jerusalem move, Morocco postponed the visit of a Romanian official, according to Romanian news outlet G4 Media.  Commitment to Syria’s unity and territorial integrity  The two King also discussed the importance of combining efforts to end the Syrian crisis in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254. The resolution, according to the monarchs, will preserve the unity and cohesion of Syria, restore security and stability in the country, while also facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland to contribute to reconstruction efforts. King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II also welcomed Iraq’s victory over ISIS, expressing their support for its stability. King Mohammed VI also applauded the Jordanian efforts in welcoming large numbers of Syrian refugees. He, however, called for further support to ensure the continuity of the humanitarian act. A Moroccan military field hospital was established in Zaatari camp in Jordan in 2012 to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees. As of November 2015, UNHCR reported that Jordan hosts 1.4 million Syrian refugees. The two monarchs also condemned Israel’s move towards the occupied Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. It annexed the territory in 1981 and has since maintained control over it.  On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation officially recognizing Israeli authority over the occupied Golan Heights. The United Nations said that its position “has remained unchanged from last week to today” despite Trump’s action Rejecting Trump’s declaration, Both King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II maintained that the Golan Heights is a Syrian land. Israel’s decision, they said, violates international law.

Rabat – The Somali minister of foreign affairs, Ahmed Isse Awad, has stressed his country’s support for Morocco’s national territorial integrity and appreciated Morocco’s support for Somalia. “In Somalia, we stand alongside the Kingdom of Morocco on the issue of its territorial integrity,” Awad declared earlier this week. He also said Morocco’s support is “very important for the strengthening of Somali institutions.” Morocco and Somalia held a signing ceremony on Tuesday, March 26, where they inked three MoUs to strengthen cooperation in politics and diplomacy. The signing ceremony comes at a time when Somalia is in the grip of a decades-long civil war. Many of the Somali population who were vulnerable to war, drought, and food insecurity, have found refuge in other countries, including Morocco. Morocco has granted refuge to seven Somali refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told Morocco World News. According to a 2017 report by the UNHCR, as many as 900,000 Somalis were displaced in the surrounding regions since 1992. In a 2018 report, UNHCR noted that Somalia is the fifth highest country of origin of refugees in the world, with an estimated 1 million refugees worldwide. Some Somalis escaped the violence and came to Morocco as a destination rather than a transit country. In reference to Morocco’s welcoming migration and asylum policy, UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi described Morocco as a model for other countries to follow.  The Moroccan and Somali foreign ministers, Nasser Bourita and Ahmed Isse Awad, signed the three MoUs on Tuesday. The first memo created the Morocco-Somalia High Joint Committee to be presided over by the foreign ministers of Morocco and Somalia. The aim is to ensure consultation and political cooperation on bilateral issues relating to regional and international common interests.  The High Joint Committee will implement cooperation at the levels of economy, finance, commerce, culture, science, judiciary system, consulate, and society. It will also monitor the process of putting into practice the agreements, treaties, and MoUs.  The second MoU intends to create a consultation facility between senior officials of the two ministries to hold regular meetings on bilateral relations and regional and international issues. The third memorandum concerns the consolidation of cooperation on diplomatic training for diplomats of both countries.  Through the partnership, Morocco and Somalia will train young diplomats within a framework of preparatory training courses and facilitate the exchange of experiences and information. In 2016, Morocco’s Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufik signed a cooperation agreement with his Somali counterpart to improve bilateral exchange in the religious field between Morocco and Somalia.  In March 2018, Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit held a working session with his Somali counterpart, Mohamed Abou Bakr Eslo, after the 35th session of the Council of Arab Interior Ministers.  The two countries discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security, especially in fighting terrorism and radicalization.

Rabat – The Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) hosted a seminar on Wednesday, March 27, in Tunis to present the Trans-Maghreb Railway Line project.  The seminar, chaired by Taieb Baccouche, the secretary-general of the AMU, discussed the rehabilitation and modernization of railways in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia as part of the planned cross-border railway line. The project involves constructing a new crossborder railway from Annaba, Algeria, to Jendouba, Tunisia; modernizing the Jendouba-Jdeida railway line in Tunisia; modernizing the railway line connecting Fez and Oujda in Morocco; and rehabilitating the line between Oujda and Akid Abbes, Algeria. Participants discussed the ways for private and public agencies to finance and implement the Maghreb railway project. The AMU said in February that it had received the financial support of the African Development Bank (AfDB) to fund the preparatory activities of the project railway. Through the project, the AMU hopes to create a Maghreb economic union that will take charge of managing goods and passenger traffic between the three countries. The project will strengthen the economic and social integration of the citizens of the region, according to an AMU statement. It will facilitate job creation and support national economies. The $3.8 billion railway line is expected to span over 2,350 kilometers, according to Al Jazeera.  According to Railways Africa, the overall project is expected to link Casablanca to Tripoli, and is only set to finish in 2060. Once the Casablanca-Tripoli railway is complete, it would take 15 hours to travel between the two cities. In addition to its “economic and trade” benefits, the project would drive the Maghreb countries to further integration, which would help “sustain peace and security” in the Euro-Mediterranean area, the former head of the Rapid Rail Network (RFR) of Greater Tunis, Kamel Ben Amor, told the Arab Weekly news outlet. Representatives of the AfDB, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency, the Maghreb Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade (BMICE), and global and regional banks attended the meeting. The general director of the Algerian National Railway Transport company (SNTF), Yacine Bendjaballah, proposed the project in 2015. Morocco’s border with Algeria has been closed nearly continuously since 1994. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have national rail networks constructed under the French colonial rule decades ago. Morocco has other rail extension ideas beyond the Maghreb line. In February, Morocco and Spain announced they were studying the possibility ofto connecting the two countries through an intercontinental railway line. The study phase will take one to two years, said Morocco’s State Secretary to the Minister of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics Mohamed Najib Boulif.

Rabat – Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that contractual teachers are hampering their students’ education with their strikes and demonstrations, vowing to expel the protesting teachers. During a press conference on Wednesday, March 27, Amzazi announced that the government will start procedures to fire the protesting teachers hired through regional academies across the country. Expressing frustration with the protests, the minister warned the teachers that the government will send them warnings of expulsion and will also cut their wages if they do not return to their work.  Amzazi also strongly criticized the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) “forced into contractual teaching” for encouraging strikes that have lasted for four weeks so far. He argued that the coordination is only adding fuel to the fire and hindering the government’s efforts to find solutions. “Despite the serious efforts we have made there is this coordination which incites employees at regional vocational training academies to stop working for the fourth week now. We are questioning, what is the legal status of this coordination? And does it have the legitimacy to lead a strike?” Amzazi affirmed that if the teachers resume their work and end their strike, the government will “provide them with all their needs and guarantee all their rights, except for the deduction of their wages,” which the government will still execute. The decision also includes the 15,000 teacher trainees at regional academies. Like the contractual teachers, the trainees will receive a warning letter, and if they do not end their strike within five days, they will be replaced by others on a waiting list. According to Amzazi, in the past four years, the government employed 70,000 teachers who were jobless. “They now have an honorable job and important job,” he stated. Beginning in February, more than 10,000 young teachers who describe themselves as “forcibly contractual educators,” made international headlines with days of marches and protests in Rabat.  The marches, organized by the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) “forced into contractual teaching,” rose against the signing of a contract extension for contractual teachers hired in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The protesting teachers are denouncing the government for not meeting their demands and accuse it of “discriminating between teachers” in Morocco through the contracts. Contractual teachers do not benefit from rights granted by the employment law for public sector employees like permanent teachers. Contractual teachers also have a smaller pension, and their salaries come from the educational academies with whom they are contracted for a certain period of time. According to the contracts, teachers’ salaries can increase depending on the employee’s pay grade. However, the ministry did not abide by some of the conditions in the contracts, teachers say. The teachers say the government should increase their salary by MAD 100 each year. The Ministry of Education offered to change the teachers from “contractual teachers” hired under fixed terms to full employees of the regional academies of education, but the teachers did not accept the proposal. The teachers said that the regional academies do not have the human and financial resources to adopt all of them.

Rabat – France’s Secretary of State for Digital Affairs Mounir Mahjoubi is stepping down from office to run for the Paris mayoral election, announced the Elysee in a statement on March 27. At the suggestion of Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed Mahjoubi alongside Minister of European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau and Government Spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux, because the three are campaigning for elections. The president is following the principle that politicians cannot fulfil their functions as well while campaigning, according to France24. Loiseau will head the La Republique en Marche (LREM) candidate list for the European elections on May 26. Griveaux and Mahjoubi are both LREM candidates to be mayor of Paris in the March 2020 local elections. Mounir Mahjoubi, a 35-year-old French-Moroccan, was appointed the secretary of state  for digital affairs in May 2017. In January, Mahjoubi announced the creation of Next40, an index of 40 French tech start-ups with strong economic and environmental potential. Mahjoubi holds a degree in business law and finance. Between 2002 and 2007, he spent his weekends working as a technician for the Internet Club, one of France’s first internet service providers.  In February 2017, Mahjoubi worked as the digital manager of Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign. Mahjoubi’s Moroccan parents came to France in the 1970s from the town of Afourar in central Morocco.

Rabat – Long before the start of the political unrest and protests in Algiers, the Sahrawis of Tindouf began their revolt against the ever-increasing corrupt, self-serving, and tribal policies of their “leader” Ibrahim Ghali. As the situation worsens in the Camps, Morocco appears unprepared to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reassure its Sahrawi citizens to return home. This episode should serve as a wake-up call for Moroccan authorities to set up programs to help defectors find a way to escape to Morocco or Mauritania where they can be processed for resettlement. The crisis in Algeria poses not just widespread political, but also economic and security, implications on Algerians as well as Sahrawis who live on international aid. The social upheaval in its neighbor to the east should not distract Rabat from its main mission to read, analyze and act on signs of possible mass desertions from Tindouf. Indeed, recent events in Sahrawi camps, including the desertion of the young officer, reveal the extent of the political turmoil in Algiers on the moral and dedication of Polisario fighters. There has been widespread discontent in the ranks of the Polisario Militia for a long while, especially since the death of some militiamen due to medical neglect last year. This incident led to protests around the refugee camps and calls for the resignation of high-ranking members of the armed group. Before that, more than thirty members of a security service called “National Gendarmerie” went on strike to protest their living conditions, meager salary, and the dwindling numbers of their force. According to sources in Shahid El Hafed where the strikers took refuge back in September, there has been an ongoing dispute between senior leaders of the Polisario over control of resources and funds of some armed units. Furthermore, the escape recently pulled off by drug traffickers from Polisario’ s facilities in Imhiriz and Tifariti rocked the camps and exposed the level of corruption and collusion between members of the organization and drug lords active in the Sahara and the Sahel regions. These incidents show Polisario’ s abandonment of its fighters and its leadership loss of control in the camps. There is a feeling in Tindouf that Ibrahim Ghali lost his compass, revolutionary and ideological, and that he is unable to lead. Given the volume of information that the Sahrawi and Spanish press have circulated about the level of disgruntlement among the Sahrawis military and civilian, an inevitable question is whether Moroccan intelligence officials have viable, sufficient and reliable plans to encourage, seduce and convince fighters to leave Tindouf. The unprecedented level of political and military interdependence between the Algerian military and the Polisario and the shaky political environment in Algiers are making some rebel leaders think about jumping ship and joining the Moroccan Sahara. Algerian and Polisario propaganda has misrepresented the truth about life in the Moroccan Sahara. The Kingdom, unfortunately, has done an average job highlighting the true situation in Laayoune, Dakhla, and Smara. The return of the 29- year-old “Captain” who drove his military vehicle and surrendered to Moroccan official is a significant event. While this type of desertion is the first in many years, it came at a sensitive time for the Polisario and the Algerian military. Decades of poor governance, mismanagement of international aid and tribal favoritism have given birth to a wave of dissent, rage, and disillusion with the revolutionary dream of an independent state. Today, thousands of Sahrawis including members of the armed militia are ready to leave the harsh conditions of the refugee camps for a normal life in the Moroccan controlled Sahara. The Moroccan intelligence community needs to organize centralized teams that can work across multiple agencies.  It must avoid the fragmentation of information, skills, and operations that can lead to failures. Rabat can successfully tackle the challenges in Tindouf if members of its intelligence organizations work hand in hand as one team and use and share all analytic resources and reports about conditions on the ground.

Rabat – The Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), President Abdelaziz Bouteflika‘s party, called for the invocation of the Algerian Constitution’s Article 102, allowing for the removal of an incapacitated president. In a statement released on Wednesday, FLN supported the proposal of Ahmed Gaid Salah, the Algerian National Army senior officer and Bouteflika’s long-time ally, to remove the president from power by applying Article 102. “We announce our support for the initiative as a start to a constitutional plan that will allow us to protect our country from dangers,” stated FLN. The party has also rejected Bouteflika’s idea to hold a national conference, saying that it is no longer a “valid”one. Although he withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term, Bouteflika plans to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. By delaying the April 18 elections, Bouteflika effectively extended his fourth term indefinitely. Meanwhile, Seddik Chihab, a spokesman for Algeria’s National Rally for Democracy (RND) party, which is in coalition with the FLN, described Bouteflika’s administration on Wednesday as “cancer.” Another ally of Bouteflika who turned against him and joined the voice of the Algerian people is former Algerian prime minister and RND leader Ahmed Ouyahia, who urged Bouteflika to resign in a message on Tuesday. In a speech on Tuesday, March 26, Gaid Salah, the most powerful army chief, insisted that the solution to Algeria’s “crisis” is in the Constitution. “We must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework that is the only guarantee to preserve a stable political situation,” Salah said. Algerian beIN SPORTS journalist Hafid Derradji, on the other hand, criticized Salah’s statement, calling it “circumentive,” and said that the “army should stay out of politics.”  “[Salah’s] intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of the temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” wrote Derradji on his Facebook page on Tuesday. Since February 22, hundreds of thousands of Algerians have been protesting in the anti-Bouteflika demonstrations, including students, judges, lawyers, unions, and many others.

Rabat – A group of 12 Polisario soldiers have presented themselves to a Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) unit near Mahbess, north-eastern Western Sahara. The 12 soldiers arrived wearing military uniforms and chanting slogans praising King Mohammed VI. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath reported Wednesday that the soldiers have been authorized to enter Moroccan territory after identity verification. This comes nine days after a 29-year-old Polisario officer arrived at the Moroccan defense line,   fleeing from Algeria. The officer had said that there are other Polisario army members who wanted to leave Polisario and return to Morocco. It remains unclear whether the 12 were Polisario deserters or Moroccan soldiers detained by Polisario. Mustapha Salma, a former leader in the Polisario Front, announced Wednesday in a Facebook post that the 12 soldiers belonged to a group of 19 Moroccan soldiers Polisario has held in custody 100 kilometers south of Mahbess in the Tifariti area, alleging that they are drug dealers. Mustapha Salma stated that 8 soldiers fled the Polisario Front in November 2018, escaping from years of detention in inhumane living conditions. Many former Polisario members have returned to Morocco from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, including Yenja Khattat, current president of the Dakhla region, and Bachir Dkhil, one of the founders of the Polisario Front. Sahrawis have conducted several protests against poor living conditions inside the Tindouf Camps. In the most recent protest, they conducted a sit-in at the United Nations Square in Geneva on March 17, to denounce the recruitment of children in the Tindouf Camps into armies and terrorist groups by Polisario.

Rabat – After long debates, Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi’s proposal to teach more subjects in French at schools has won the favor of the majority of the heads of political parties in Parliament on Monday, March 25. The parliamentary meeting, attended by Amzazi and Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki, agreed on a reform to teach science and technology subjects in French.  Amzazi argued that “some subjects should be taught in a foreign language,” referring to French, “for the benefit of students.” The decision is in line with the Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research in 2015. On Thursday, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani will sign a decree to convene an extraordinary Parliament session in April, which will review and implement the pedagogical reform. The debate on which foreign language would be more useful in the Moroccan educational system continues, especially when it comes to science. Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) are the official languages of Morocco, and French is the primary foreign language in the country.  As some Moroccans, including politicians and professors, believe that schools should teach science in French, others vouch for other languages like English and Arabic. Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane defended the use of Arabic in national education during the National Conference on the Arabic Language on March 15 at the National Library (BNRM) in Rabat. Benkirane also preferred English over French. “If [higher] education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French,” he stated.

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Rabat has sentenced four journalists and one member of Parliament to a six months suspended prison sentence and a fine of MAD 10,000, each. The journalists—Mohamed Aheddad with Al Massae newspaper, Abdelhak Belachgar with Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper, and Kaoutar Zaki and Abdelilah Sakhir with Aljarida24 online outlet—and MP Abdelhak Hissane began their trial in early 2018. The president of the House of Councillors, Hakim Benchamach, brought the lawsuit against them. Benchamach sued the four journalists for reporting “on excerpts of the classified documents, in December 2016, of the former head of government, Abdelilah Benkirane, in the commission of inquiry into the deficit of the Moroccan pension fund (CMR),” according to Medias24. He sued Hissane for leaking the information. The journalists and the MP were prosecuted under Article 14 of the procedural rules governing parliamentary commissions of investigation.  The article stipulates total confidentiality in the commission’s work. Anyone who has published information from the commission can incur a sentence from one to five years in prison, with a fine from MAD 1,000 to 10,000. Mohamed Aheddad declared to AFP news agency that “the verdict is against the freedom of expression.” Aheddad further stated that he was prosecuted along with the other journalists for “publishing accurate information.” He said that they would appeal the verdict and argued that he is convinced of his innocence. MP Abdelhak Hissane told AFP, “The verdict is unfair and based on nothing.” He added that “the journalists were just doing their job.” In agreement, the National Union of the Moroccan Press (SNPM) published a statement on March 27, condemning the verdict, considering it “unfair towards the four journalists and the freedom of the press.” The SNPM holds Benchamach responsible and described him as a “self-proclaimed opponent of the freedom of the press and expression.”

Rabat – The Australian teenager known as “Egg Boy” who gained international praise after he cracked an egg on a far-right politician’s head has broken his media silence. The 17-year-old, whose real name is William Connolly, went viral after he smashed an egg on far-right Senator Fraser Anning’s head during a political meeting on March 16. Anning proceeded to punch the teen several times in the head before his entourage of supporters tackled the teenager to the ground and put him in a headlock. The whole series of events was caught on camera and received 2 million views within just a few hours of being posted. The egging incident came after Anning released a statement blaming Muslims and immigration for the March 15 terrorist attack on Christchurch’s Islamic community that left 50 people dead. Instead of blaming the far-right terrorist who committed the attack, he said in his statement that “the real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” Ever since he cracked the egg that divided the nation, Melbourne teenager Will Connolly, better known as #EggBoy, has been both vilified and dubbed the “hero of the Earth”. Will approached us to set the record straight. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/31VogQPs5C — The Project (@theprojecttv) March 25, 2019 Despite going viral, Connolly remained mostly silent until this week. Speaking to Australian talk show “The Project” on Monday, March 25, Connolly acknowledged that even though cracking an egg over a senator’s head was not the right thing to do, the egging “united people.” He said he initially attended the political meeting to see if Anning “could change my mind,” and only after an hour of listening to the senator speak did he make his decision. “I’m a pretty forgiving person and in my mind, I wanted to forgive him, but then he started saying some more things.”  When asked why he thought the senator deserved an egging, he answered: “After that tragedy in Christchurch, I thought the world should be supporting all those victims.”  He continued, “The Senator released a statement that was pretty much a divisive hate speech blaming the victims for the attack — and I was just flat-out disgusted.”  When asked if he was an activist of any kind, Connolly replied: “I don’t know much about politics at all, I’m not pro any specific religion, I’m just pro-humanity.” He added he is not a member of any political party or organization.  Some criticized his actions following the incident, saying there is no room for any kind of violence in political discourse and the act drew attention away from those affected by the Christchurch terror attack. When asked whether there is ever a good reason to physically attack a politician, he said, “There’s no reason to physically attack anyone,” and he “can understand why some people reacted the way they did.”  Connolly elaborated, “I understand what I did was not the right thing to do; however, this egg has united people and money has been raised, tens of thousands of dollars has been raised for those victims.”  A GoFundMe was created for Connolly to help raise funds to cover any legal fees and buy “more eggs.” The fundraiser raised over AUD 80,000 (US $57,000) and Connolly received yet more admiration after he pledged to donate all funds to those affected by the Christchurch attack. Connolly was also offered a Ferrari, a holiday to Turkey, free tickets from famous bands, and a lifetime supply of beer among other gifts.  The 17-year-old said the attention he has received since the incident was completely unexpected, and it has not been easy for him. “I didn’t think this was going to blow up, it’s blown up completely out of proportion.” Connolly received applause worldwide for his especially proactive response to Anning’s Islamophobia. One Muslim teenager, while standing in front of a hospital in Christchurch, told Buzzfeed News, “Did you see that video of the Queensland senator being hit by an egg? That made my day.” “It’s a bit embarrassing actually because too much attention is actually being brought away from the real victims suffering, we should be focusing on them. I was just going to show my mates, it was just going to be a few laughs,” Connolly recounted. He said being called Egg Boy was actually starting to annoy him, and that funnily enough, he had been called Egg Boy at school even before the famous incident. “I’d eat boiled eggs at lunch and all the girls would be like ‘get away from me, that reeks,’” he said. “I’m off the eggs now, officially off the eggs.”     To my family, friends and people around the world, I would like to thank everyone for all the overwhelming support. I’m so proud to stand for what is right and I encourage everyone to stand up for what you all believe in. I do not condone violence and I do not condone egging someone, and everyone has a right to an opinion, but as I listened to Senator Anning for over an hour, I realised a point had to be made and if no one was going to do anything, then I was. I’m so humbled to be able to shed more light in response to the Christchurch shootings. My heart goes out to all who are suffering. I’ve had one lady from Christchurch tell me that through this period of darkness in her life, it’s the first time she’s smiled since the shootings, which meant so much to me. The main focus here has to be the people who are suffering and the issue at hand, and I’m really happy it has united people the way it has. I will continue to try and make the world a better place and I hope the end of racism is on the horizon. Keep spreading the love ❤️. Will Connolly A post shared by  will Connolly (@willconnolly__) on Mar 25, 2019 at 1:28am PDT Connolly also released a statement on Instagram following his talk show appearance, thanking people for their overwhelming support and encouraging others to “stand up for what you all believe in.” He added that he does “not condone violence and I do not condone egging someone, and everyone has a right to an opinion, but as I listened to Senator Anning for over an hour, I realized a point had to be made and if no one was going to do anything, then I was.” He reiterated that now should be a time to focus on the victims. “I’ve had one lady from Christchurch tell me that through this period of darkness in her life, it’s the first time she’s smiled since the shootings, which meant so much to me. The main focus here has to be the people who are suffering and the issue at hand, and I’m really happy it has united people the way it has.” While many believed Anning’s reaction to punch the teen several times in the face was unjustified, Anning said it was simply self-defense. “He got a slap across the face, which is what his mother should have given him long ago, because he’s been misbehaving badly,” Senator Anning said. “When someone cracks you on the back of the head you react and defend yourself. That for years is what Australians have been doing. Luckily they did that in the trenches and otherwise we’d all be speaking German now.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison disagreed though, saying Anning should “face the full force of the law” for his violent reaction. Anning has only doubled down on his divisive statements since the attack, saying, “Countries that allow large-scale immigration invariably have an escalation in crime, violence and terrorist attacks. Now, as far as I’m concerned, that’s just a statement of fact.”  World leaders condemned Fraser Anning’s statement, with New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern simply describing the comments as a “disgrace.”  Scott Morrison said Anning’s words were “disgusting” and, “Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.”

Rabat – The Moroccan American Network will host its fourth Business Forum – CEO Summit at the Willard InterContinental Hotel, in Washington, D.C. The summit will focus on small business opportunities between the US and Africa. The day of the event corresponds with “Morocco Day,” celebrated March 29. In 2018, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed March 29 as “Morocco Day” following a formal resolution by the D.C. Council.  “Morocco Day is an opportunity to explore economic, cultural, and educational exchange opportunities that are mutually beneficial for the Kingdom of Morocco and the United States of America,” according to Antoine Battle, CEO of Diplomatic Communications. Establishing Morocco Day in D.C. was just the “first step in a long and ambitious journey to strengthen Morocco’s position in the United States of America,” said Mohamed El Hajjam, the President of the Moroccan American Network. The Business Forum-CEO Summit will be attended by members of the Royal Cabinet of Morocco, D.C. Government, the US Black Chambers, the National US-Arab Chamber of Commerce, think tank experts, academics, and business leaders. “The summit is designed to expand opportunities for conducting business in Africa, and we are honored to have the city of Zagora, Morocco as a guest of honor, representing Morocco’s Eighth Region,” El Hajjam said. “Specifically, we want to highlight opportunities for greater collaboration and exchange of ideas, promoting foreign investment and economic growth.” The Morocco delegation will include Mohamed El Rherrass, state secretary to the minister of national education for vocational training, higher education and scientific research; Abderrahim Chahid, president of the Provincial Council of Zagora; Hmad Ayt Baha, MP; and Mohammed Elansari, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Draa-Tafilalet region. The official recognition of Morocco Day in Washington, D.C., reflects recognition by lawmakers and American citizens of Morocco’s long-standing relationship with the United States. El Hajjam said that the Moroccan American Network has a strategy to celebrate Morocco Day by recognizing one of Morocco’s twelve regions each year. This year, the event is celebrating the city of Zagora in the Draa-Tafilalet region. The Moroccan American Network creates opportunities for small businesses in the United States, Morocco, and Africa. The organization hosts forums, dialogue and events to educate the American public, media, and government about business and investment opportunities in the region. The network also sponsors exchange trips between the US and Morocco.

Rabat – A declassified document has revealed that Morocco’s proposal for a mutually acceptable settlement in Western Sahara was an American initiative in the first place. The US has been a staunch Moroccan ally on Western Sahara and plans to remain so even as it seeks to navigate the complexities of the conflict in Western Sahara, the document suggests. Titled “Sahara Policy History,” the seven-page document, which appears to have been written by the former Moroccan ambassador to Washington, Aziz Mekouar, shed light on previously unknown US support for Morocco’s Western Sahara claims. Morocco’s position in Western Sahara has in the last decade insisted that only through a “realistic” and “feasible” compromise-based solution can the Sahara dispute be brought to an end. Rabat laid that principle out in a 2007 document that has come to be known as the “Autonomy Plan.” The idea is to advance local Sahrawi autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. But according to the declassified document, the plan was conceived at the US’ request. “To solve the problem” in Western Sahara, the declassified document noted, “Morocco proposed in 2007, at American urging, a plan for a very broad autonomy for the region.” After that straightforward revelation in the introduction, the document provided a full roadmap of the events and people that contributed to the writing and adoption of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. It explained, “The present state of play on this issue is a direct result of an American initiative in 1999 to change course on how best to resolve the problem. The abandonment of the referendum option has been an American policy initiative, not a Moroccan one, and it took a very difficult internal political debate for Morocco to follow the American request to propose autonomy for the Sahara.” When the UN brokered a ceasefire between the Polisario Front and Morocco in 1991, the initial move was to station a peacekeeping mission—MINURSO—in the disputed territories until the conflicting parties could reach an agreement on referendum. By 1998, however, a series of failed attempts to prepare the ground for the promised referendum prompted stakeholders to realize it was a doomed idea because of fundamental disagreements between Morocco and Polisario over who should be allowed to vote. Faced with a political and procedural stalemate, the US State Department took the initiative in December 1998 to produce a “policy review” on how to best end the diplomatic gridlock. The review, which saw the contribution of the US ambassador in Rabat, Edward Gabriel, and the embassy’s political counselor, Bob Holley, concluded that the referendum option was a “dead end,” according to the declassified document. Having abandoned the referendum alternative, the US urged for a “political solution” brokered on the basis of a “negotiated, political solution to the problem.” Important in the move was the idea that the negotiated solution would be based on “continued Moroccan sovereignty in the Sahara, but with the granting of a broad and substantial (by international standards) autonomy for the territory,” according to the declassified document. Even as the Clinton administration presented its conclusions to King Hassan II, convincing him of the viability of the “broad autonomy” option in contrast to the impossibility of a referendum, the Moroccan monarch did not immediately approve of the move. “He lacked confidence that Algeria would be prepared to bargain in good faith on such a compromise – nor was it clear that he had much confidence in the willingness or ability of the United States to become a full partner in bringing Algeria to this point of view,” the document said of the King’s initial skepticism. By July 1999, the King, having apparently reached an agreement with Algeria’s newly emerging strong man, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, that “a solution along the lines of the American proposal was now possible,” the Moroccan monarch finally agreed to the proposal. But he died three days after agreeing to the proposal. King Mohammed VI, who replaced his father in 1999, was quickly briefed on the pending proposal. After the new King green-lighted the plan, the next move was to associate the UN mission in Western Sahara with what the US believed was the most effective way of ending the longstanding dispute in Western Sahara. Senior American diplomats subsequently briefed James Baker, who was then the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara. Baker, the document notes, “agreed with the approach and undertook to shape a proposal with Morocco that was consistent with the sovereignty/autonomy approach.” In the spring of 2000, Baker met with King Mohammed VI to discuss the proposal. Baker said after the meeting that he was convinced of the new Moroccan King’s genuine desire to commit to “an internationally acceptable autonomy arrangement for the people of the Sahara, under Moroccan sovereignty.” In 2001, Baker proposed a settlement plan known as “the Framework Agreement,” consistent with the US-inspired autonomy plan and hours of behind-the-door negotiations with Moroccan diplomats. Morocco accepted Baker’s proposal, but Algeria and Polisario vehemently opposed it. After that first initial failure and subsequent difficulties in passing a settlement proposal at the UN Security Council, Baker “secretly negotiated another proposal with Algeria and the Polisario Front, which he eventually tabled in 2003 as ‘the Peace Plan.’” The plan brought back the referendum option to the table. But Morocco, taken aback by the sudden change in Baker’s move, categorically rejected the “Peace Plan.” However, because of “Baker’s great prestige both in New York and in Washington, there was considerable confusion as to whether he spoke for himself only, or for the new Administration,” the declassified document noted. Those doubts ended in September 2003 after King Mohammed VI met with US President George Bush. President Bush told the King that Baker was not a US official, implying that the UN official’s actions on the Sahara question had nothing to do with the official US position. Bush promised the King that his administration would commit to the action plan Morocco had agreed to with the Clinton administration, urging the King to go ahead and put together the autonomy plan. With inputs from US officials, Morocco produced its “Autonomy Plan” and presented it to the UN in 2007. The US was among the first countries that saluted the Moroccan proposal, calling it “serious and credible.” Seeing that the US was siding with Rabat, Baker resigned from his UN position. While many of the events highlighted in the declassified document were already public knowledge, the information that Washington was the originator comes at a politically-charged time as the UN pushes for a sustainable settlement to the dispute. In line with the latest UN move to revert back to supporting Morocco after months of wavering commitment, the news of the US requesting the autonomy proposal is bound to ditch many speculations that have surrounded the international politicking in Western Sahara. Meanwhile, the declassified document suggested that Morocco continues to wait for the day when the US will publically reiterate its support for Morocco’s Western Sahara claims. But the news of the US helping in the entire process of what has become Morocco’s trademark on the Sahara dossier is also set to comfort Morocco in its growing confidence that only its position will stand the test of realism and political pragmatism. Morocco is already convinced that its proposal is more feasible and more in line with UN requirements than Polisario’s position is. With the unpredictability that has fraught the Trump administration, however, it remains to be seen whether the current, or the subsequent, US administration will provide Morocco with what other US administrations simply flirted with: Disclosed and full support for Morocco’s Western Sahara position.

Rabat – Morocco has reportedly requested the postponement of a visit planned by Romanian Senate President Calin Popescu Tariceanu to the North African country. Sources told Romanian outlet G4 Media that the Moroccan government might have canceled the meeting due to a busy agenda. “The Moroccan side has transmitted via diplomatic channels that it was not available for meetings.” The news outlet reported that Tariceanu’s official visit to Morocco was scheduled for March 27-31. “It was postponed at the request of the Moroccan party, to be reprogrammed for a later period, to be agreed upon.” Morocco’s alleged decision followed the announcement of King Abdullah II of Jordan that he would cancel his visit to Romania this week. He visited Morocco instead in response to Romania’s Prime Minister Viorica Dancila announcing plans to move her country’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan News Agency (Petra) said, “The decision came in solidarity with Jerusalem, following Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila’s remarks on Sunday.” Following King Abdullah’s cancellation, Morocco’s news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) announced that the Jordanian monarch changed his destination to Morocco. MAP reported that the Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery said that King Mohammed VI will meet King Abdullah II to hold official talks. Morocco’s alleged decision to postpone the Romanian official’s visit to Morocco King Abdullah’s cancellation of his visit to Romania suggest that both monarchs will discuss the Palestinian cause and US President Donald Trump’s proclamation recognizing Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights. According to G4 Media, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis criticized Dancila, accusing her of being “responsible for canceling King Abdullah II’s visit to Romania, who felt personally offended by her statements on the relocation of Israel’s Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.” “The prime minister shows complete ignorance regarding foreign affairs,” said Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

Rabat – A Casablanca court will announce its verdict in the final appeal for the convicted Hirak Rif activists, including Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, on Friday, April 5.   In a Facebook post, Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, shared a letter from the imprisoned Hirak activists reiterating their rejection of “marginalization, opportunism, political and economic corruption,” and their call for justice, dignity, integrity, and freedom. Although the Moroccan state rejected accusations of violence against the Hirak activists, the Hirak detainees insisted in their letter that “hundreds of [them] were subjected to torture,” and “unfair trials and sentences.” The Hirak activists attended their appeal hearing last January 14, but Zefzafi condemned the “absence of fair trial conditions” and vowed to boycott the rest of his appeal hearings.  Quoted by his father, Zefzafi had said, “[The trial] is but a stage play by the judicial institution … Therefore, I declare to the local, national and international public that I am boycotting this trial, in which the most basic conditions of fairness do not exist.” Responding to torture allegations by Amnesty International, Moroccan authorities said earlier this month in a statement that the NGO did not provide any evidence for its conclusion in its reports about the Hirak case. Moroccan authorities condemned Amnesty International’s statements twice. The first time was in January when the ministry said that the NGO’s position was “blatant interference” and a “clear violation of the most basic international standards.” Amnesty had said then that “Morocco’s judicial authorities must ensure the appeal trial does not descend into another charade marred by torture complaints and other fair trial violations.” Amnesty also condemned the heavy sentences activists received. In June 2018, a Casablanca court handed down sentences varying from 1 to 20 years to 54 Hirak activists for participating in the “unauthorized” Hirak protests. Nasser Zefzafi received 20 years. Between 2016 and 2017, police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the Hirak Rif protests in northern Morocco. The movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, an Al Hoceima fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities.  The incident caused citizens across Morocco, but particularly in the Rif region, to rise in major protests against social disparities in Morocco.

Rabat – The Moroccan and Malagasy foreign ministries have signed a cooperation agreement to enhance gender equality and an agreement on youth and sports cooperation. Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Malagasy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andriantsitohaina Franck Michel Naina signed nine agreements in total on Tuesday, March 26, during the first session of the Morocco-Madagascar Joint Cooperation Committee in Marrakech. Bourita and Naina signed agreements on the promotion of gender equality, combating sexual discrimination in education and the job market, and preventing violence against women. Madagascar may have useful experience to share with Morocco regarding gender equality. In the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Gender Gap Report, Madagascar ranked 84th out of 149 countries, whereas Morocco ranked 137th. The report focuses on the gender gap between men and women across four key areas: Health, education, economy, and politics. According to the the OECD Development Centre’s Social Institutions and Gender Index, Madagascar enshrined equality between the sexes in its constitution and amended its family code to raise the age of marriage from 14 for women and 17 for men to 18 for both sexes in 2007.  In a 2019 World Bank analysis, however, Morocco scored slightly better (73.13) than Madagascar (71.88). The analysis studied women’s freedom of movement, laws affecting women’s decisions to enter the labor market, laws affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage gap, and protection from sexual harassment. In September 2018, Morocco implemented Law 103-13, which criminalizes violence and sexual discrimination against women and can bring up to one year imprisonment, for example, in cases of street harassment of forced underage marriage. The two countries also signed action programs on youth and sports for the next two years, allowing people to take part in artistic and cultural events. It will also facilitate access for Malagasy students and teaching staff to use sports training institutes in Morocco. The committee’s first session also saw the signing of cooperation agreements and MOUs on diplomat training, scientific research, scholarships, internships, urban planning and housing policy, and decentralization.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior has said it will “firmly” address all illegal practices that threaten public safety and order in a statement about the contractual teachers’ sit-in overnight Saturday, March 23. The ministry’s statement, published on March 26, also dealt with the security forces’ response to the protest.  The ministry argued that security forces’ use of water cannon to disperse protesters “was proportionate and respected all legal provisions far from the fabricated images conveyed on social networks.” Stating that the government has responded positively to contractual teachers’ demands, the ministry condemned their continued protesting and rejection of the government’s offers. The contractual teachers are now in their fourth week of protests. The ministry stated that security forces conducted a direct dialogue with the protestors to end the overnight sit-in in front of Parliament at midnight before firing water cannons to disperse them.  Security forces fired the water cannons to prohibit acts violating public order, according to the statement. The statement added that the local authority offered to transport protesters to their respective cities and provide accommodation. The demonstrators rejected the proposal and continued to protest until 2:30 a.m. on Sunday. Although police attempted to disperse the protesters, some of the protesters “persisted in their practices of incitement and provocation of the public forces,” throwing stones and bottles and injuring 21 police officers and five members of the auxiliary forces, the statement concluded. Morocco’s Ministry of Higher Education has proposed reforms to improve contractual teachers’ work situation. The reform would give contractual teachers the same labor protection as permanent teachers, health care, a pension fund, early retirement in case of a permanent sickness, and the right to promotions to posts with greater responsibilities. Contractual teachers are employed for a fixed term within regional academies. Compared to permanent teachers who are employed as regular government employees, contractual teachers are entitled to a smaller pension after retirement. Although they receive the same salary, contractors are paid by the academies with whom they have contracted.

Rabat – A recent ranking from the largest global travel hub, Tripadvisor, has again confirmed Marrakech’s popular standing as one of the best destinations for international and local tourists. TripAdvisor ranked Marrakech ninth in its top 10 Traveler’s Choice Destinations in the World for 2019. The world’s top 10 destinations put the Moroccan city ahead of Dubai. London topped the list, while Paris landed in second, ahead of Rome (third); Crete, Greece (fourth); and Bali, Indonisia (fifth). Marrakech was the only African city to feature in the top 10. Only one other African destination, Hurghada, Egypt, made it into the top 25 at 21st place. “Award winners were determined using an algorithm based on reviews and ratings for hotels, restaurants and experiences in destinations worldwide over a 12-month period. The methodology takes into account quality and volume of reviews to surface destinations that consistently deliver the best overall experience for travelers,” said the world’s largest travel site.
 Marrakech, Morocco’s top tourist destination, attracts thousands of international and local travelers each year, including celebrities. In December 2018, Morocco’s National Tourist Office (ONMT) said that Marrakech recorded over 2.4 million tourist arrivals from January to November in 2018 and had 2.6 million scheduled hotel stays through the end of 2018. In March 2018, Trip Advisor ranked  Marrakech as the eighth best destination  for travelers, ahead of Istanbul, New York, and Dubai. “The red city of Marrakech is a magical place brimming with markets, gardens, palaces and mosques,” said TripAdvisor. This month, TripAdvisor also listed the Top 10 Travelers’ Choice Destinations in the US. New York is the first in the list, followed by two Hawaiian islands, Maui (second) and Oahu (third).

Rabat – Moroccan-French comedian Yassine Belattar is under police custody in Paris’s fifth arrondissement for allegedly making death threats and for sexual harassment in the workplace, according to AFP news agency sources. Belattar, a dual-nationality radio host, went to the police station Tuesday morning after a preliminary investigation into his conduct opened in late January, Le Monde reported. French comedian Bruno Gaccio had filed a complaint against Belattar for death threats. He said Belattar had threatened to attack his family, as French outlet Mediapart reported. Gaccio also filed a complaint for defamation, claiming Belattar called him a rapist during a public argument on social media. According to Mediapart, three other men in the entertainment industry also testified to police that Belattar threatened them with physical violence. “Many people spoke of humiliating or threatening behavior. Two women reported being sexually harassed while looking for a job,” the outlet added. It reported additional allegations of harassment, some made anonymously, others publicly, such as by television host Jessie Clair. In an investigation led by the news outlet, in which reporters had interrogated Yassine Belattar at length twice, one year apart, about the harassment charges, Mediapart concluded, “While he denies any accusation of ‘harassment’ at work, he is not hiding on the other hand that he usually uses words intended to frighten his interlocutors.” Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Belattar to the Presidential Council of Cities which focuses on priority neighborhoods.

Rabat – The United Nations has said it hopes all member states support its work in Western Sahara, after 37 African states reiterated their support for the UN’s exclusive role in mediating the Western Sahara conflict. The spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, commented on the 37 countries’ decision in a press briefing on Tuesday, March 26. Of the 54 African countries, 37 states convened in Marrakech on Monday to make a declaration in support of the UN-led political process.  Asked if Antonio Guterres had a response to the declaration, Dujarric said, “The SG’s response is in the work and the effort of his Special Envoy, Mr. [Horst] Kohler, who you know just finished a latest round of discussions with the parties.” “We would hope that all Member States support the UN’s effort, as they are… as Mr Köhler’s efforts are being mandated by the Security Council,” added Dujarric. While the 37 countries reaffirmed the UN’s role at the Marrakech conference, several other states engaged in a symposium hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity. Algeria, and several other southern African countries attended the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi people in South Africa on March 25-26.South Africa and Namibia co-hosted the event. During the symposium, attended by Polisario Front leader Ibrahim Ghali, representatives discussed ways to solve the conflict by supporting the separatist principle of self-determination. By contrast, the 37 countries, which convened in Marrakech on Monday, reiterated support for the AU’s Decision 693 adopted in July 2018 at the 31st AU session in Nouakchott, Mauritania. The decision pushed back against efforts to mediate the conflict within the AU, affirming the UN as the only legitimate body to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

Rabat – Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most prevalent airborne diseases in Morocco, affecting more than 30,000 people every year, according to Moroccan Minister of Health Anas Doukkali. Following World Tuberculosis Day on March 24, Doukkali announced on Monday—during a national meeting to prepare an action plan to end tuberculosis in Morocco by 2030—that the annual TB case rate is 87 cases per 100,000 people. Tuberculosis is most likely to affect people aged 15 to 45. Pulmonary tuberculosis, a contagious bacterial infection of the lungs, makes up half of the TB cases in Morocco. Doukkali said that 70 percent of tuberculosis patients are from marginal neighborhoods near major cities like Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat, Sale, Kenitra, Marrakech, Safi, Fez, Meknes, the northern regions of Tetouan and Al Hoceima, and the southern Souss-Massa region.  According to the latest tuberculosis statistics, 86 percent of annual tuberculosis cases are found in those cities and regions which are home to 78 percent of the Moroccan population. Doukkali noted that Morocco’s national program has achieved positive results in diagnosing and successful treating tuberculosis. The rate of detection of the infectious disease, which enables early treatment, rose from 75 to 85 percent in Morocco since 1995, said Doukkali. In 2016, a total of 31,542 cases of tuberculosis were recorded in Morocco, according to the ministry. To limit the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health is allocating an annual sum that has more than doubled from MAD 30 million (over $3 million) in 2012 to MAD 76 million (over $7.8 million) in 2018. Doukkali rued that the global annual rate of tuberculosis infections did not decrease “despite the efforts of all world health organizations.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis, and 1.6 million people died from the disease worldwide in 2017. Tuberculosis is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the “Mycobacterium tuberculosis” bacteria that commonly affects the lungs. It is a contagious infection that spreads through the air from an infected patient’s coughs, sneezes, or spit.  “TB is a treatable and curable disease. Active, drug-susceptible TB disease is treated with a standard 6 month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs … Between 2000 and 2017, an estimated 54 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment,” says the WHO.

Rabat – Algerian journalist Hafid Derradji has criticized the “circumentive” statement of Algeria’s powerful National Army chief, Gaid Salah, who called on the Constitutional Council to remove President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power by implementing Article 102. Derradji took to his Facebook to comment on Salah’s statement, which shocked many Algerian citizens supporting the Algerian Hirak protest movement. The senior officer has long been known for his unwavering support for Bouteflika.   The beIN SPORTS journalist wrote: “Do they want Bouteflika’s departure and the continuation of the system?? Is the activation of Article 102 a constitutional solution or a coup against the will of the people?” According to Article 102, “whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” In a televised interview, Derradji questioned Gaid Salah’s capacity to make such statements. Since Salah resigned from political office and only holds a military position, Derradji asked, “With which capacity does the chief of staff speak?” He suggested that Gaid Salah cannot order the application of Article 102 because he is no longer deputy minister of defense. Derradji said that the Constitution clearly asks the army to stay out of politics under any circumstances. Against Algerians demands? Derradji then asked if there is a “consensus” between the chief of staff and Said Bouteflika, Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s brother, who has long been accused by political observers of controlling the Algerian regime. “President Bouteflika left a long time ago in my opinion,” said Derradji, asking whether there is a “consensus for what can be saved.” Before the interview, Derradji said that Gaid Salah could not have commented without Said Bouteflika’s knowledge. “His intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” wrote Derradji. Derradji also recalled when Salah himself was among the majority who supported Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term. He added that Salah was among the group who submitted a file with a medical certificate to prove that Bouteflika was qualified to run for president again. “How can he be eligible a few weeks ago and is not qualified today? These are the existing contradictions,” the journalist concluded. It is not the first time Derradji commented on Algeria’s hirak, the popular movement against the “pouvoir,” or the system. In February, Derradji criticized Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term before his decision to step down. Derradji wrote that people in Algeria “started feeling ashamed.” “Bouteflika did not run, nor can he make his candidacy, nor campaign, nor even swear in,” said Derradji, doubting Bouteflika’s ability to perform “his constitutional duties.”

Rabat –  Themis, a Morocco-based electricity company, has concluded a partnership with the Kingline Development Nigeria company to build a natural gas electricity plant in Ondo State Industrial Park in southern Nigeria. Themis and Kingline expect the new power plant, called the Kinglinge Power Project, to be one of the world’s “lowest cost gas-to-power facilities.” Themis, backed by the international Denham Capital equity firm, will provide funding in the $600 million project. Tas Anvaripour, CEO of the Casablanca-based power supplier Neo Themis, stated, “Kingline offers compelling advantages for the Federal Government of Nigeria given its extremely competitive pricing, availability of peripheral gas and transmission infrastructure, timing to operation, and technical flexibility.” Kingline plans to sell 4.5 terawatts per hour of electricity to the state-run electricity company when the project becomes fully operational by 2022, according to Business Day. The project includes a 550 megawatt combined cycle powerhouse, a substation, a desalination facility, and related infrastructure. With the aim to support power projects in Africa, Neo Themis was set up in 2018 to launch the Africa Power Investment Platform under a partnership between Themis and Denham Capital. Nigeria currently has an operational capacity of 4,000 megawatts. However, it has 13,400 megawatts at maximum capacity and 15,000 megawatts of demand. Kingline’s CEO Sean Kim expressed his excitement at working with Themis: “The Project has strong technical and financial support and will deliver a powerful solution for Nigeria, cost-competitive within any international market.” In May 2017, Morocco and Nigeria partnered to build the Gazoduc project linking Nigeria to Morocco through a gas pipeline. The pipeline would benefit over 300 million people. The project aims to speed up electrification projects in West Africa and create competition in the region. However, the progress of the project is facing challenges, according to a study conducted by Fetch Solutions. The project, it says, will face delays due to political and security concerns in the region. It said that the the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline will face “considerable commercial, technical, legal and financial challenges” making the project “unlikely to materialize in the short or medium-term.”

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Sale has sentenced the train driver in the Bouknadel train accident to time served, five months and five days, and a fine of MAD 500. The court announced the verdict on Tuesday, March 26. Police arrested the driver, Laarbi Rich, following an investigation after the train he was driving derailed on October 16, 2018, near Bouknadel, north of Rabat. Laarbi Rich was detained in prison on October 23, 2018, and prosecutors charged him with murder, accidental injuries, and driving the train over the speed limit.  The court president, El Malki Hizam, announced that Rich would only get a “time served” sentence equal to the time he had already spent in prison, five months and five days. Rich left the prison today. Rich’s defence threatened previously to sue the government for detaining him, saying there was no evidence to convict him. However, Rich was found guilty of homicide and unintentional injuries. The train derailment killed 7 people and left 125 injured. The charges carried punishments between five months and five years in prison and a fine of MAD 250 to 1,000, as stipulated by Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code. The judge ordered medical examinations on the individuals injured before bringing a court case against the National Office of Railways (ONCF). A number of doctors have been designated to carry out the medical examinations. They will also determine the duration of the survivors’ disability. The judge has fixed April 26 as the deadline to submit the medical examinations. He also fixed May 7 as the date of the ONCF trial. Rich’s defence blamed ONCF for not communicating with the driver and for not providing the train with automatic braking nor a display screen. They also accused ONCF of breaching Article 58 of the criminal procedure code, arguing that some evidence was corrupted.

Rabat – Uber announced on Monday night that it will be paying $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes for full ownership of Dubai-based ride-hailing company Careem. The tech deal is the largest of the kind in the Middle East, overpassing Amazon’s acquisition of Souq for $580 million in 2017. The Careem brand will stay intact for now, and the cofounders of the company, Mudassir Sheikha, Magnus Olsson, and Abdulla Elyas are staying on with Careem, the companies said. However, the structure of Careem’s board will change. Three seats will go to Uber representatives and the remaining two to Careem. Uber has previously operated in Morocco, launching in Casablanca in June 2015, but it halted operations just three years later due to local regulations. As Morocco only allows taxis to register as a legitimate service, Uber was operating in a legal gray area simply connecting independent drivers and passengers through its application.  In an official statement, Uber explained that their decision to stop operating was due to the lack of “clarity about integrating applications like Uber into the existing transport model.”  Uber also faced backlash from taxi drivers, who said the service was unfairly undercutting them. Tensions between taxi drivers and Uber drivers even escalated into violence, with numerous incidents being reported of intimidation, threats, car chases, and Uber vehicles being vandalized.  Uber said in its statement that “the current regulatory uncertainty does not allow us to provide a safe and reliable experience that meets the requirements of our customers, both drivers and passengers.” Careem was founded in March 2012 in Dubai and currently serves over 100 cities in 14 countries in the Middle East, Southern Asia, and Africa, including Morocco. Even though Careem was in an identical position to Uber when it launched in Morocco, the company pushed through the criticism and gained popularity.  Careem estimated it had 300,000 users in Morocco in 2018, whereas Uber only had 19,000 users in Morocco at its peak before terminating its services. Uber’s acquisition of Careem comes during a difficult time for the company. Uber booked a $1.8 billion loss in 2018, and exited China, Russia, and eight Southeast Asian countries, selling its business in the regions to homegrown startups similar to Careem. The acquisition of Careem is pending regulatory approval and is expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2020.

Rabat – After weeks of protests by contractual teachers, Omar Balafrej, an MP of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), stated in an interview with Moroccan news outlet Walaw that employing teachers under a fixed-term contract is “nonsense.” Contractual teachers have staged a number of strikes across Morocco over recent weeks demanding to be integrated into the public sector.  The government has hired teachers under annually renewable contracts every year since 2016.To fill the need for more teachers while managing heavy public debts, the government hired the teachers through regional academies. The contractual teachers’ unions are protesting the government’s alleged inability to meet their demands to be hired into the public sector and provide free public education. Hinting at the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) and the opposition Istiqlal (Independence) Party (PI), Balafrej, whose PSU belongs to the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD), argued that those who own private schools do not want to reform the education system because reform threatens their interests. “These people,” stated Balafrej, “belong to powerful political parties like the PJD and the PI.” He continued, “Some MPs even call for privatizing education even in marginalized and rural areas.” Approximately 1 million students from middle-class families attend private school in Morocco, generating a profit of  MAD 10 billion, according to Balafrej. Balafrej argued that some private sectors should be nationalized, citing Sweden as an example of a country with a 0 percent rate of private schooling at primary and secondary levels and Turkey as a country with a 1 percent rate. According to a 2015 report conducted by several Moroccan organizations, beginning with the implementation of the National Charter for Education and Training (NCET), Morocco has been promoting private education. The charter states that “the private education and training sector is considered as a main partner, alongside the State, in the promotion of the education and training system, the broadening of its extension and the continuous improvements of its quality.” The solution, Balafrej proposes, is that the government should improve the public school system. Private school should not be a necessity but an option, he said.  “What we need to do is to show a strong willingness to hold out against lobbyists of the private sector. Public education is not only about employment under fixed contracts,” Balafrej stressed. In sympathy with contractual teachers, the National Syndicate of Higher Education (SNESup) declared that they are going to protest at the Ministry of Education in Rabat on Thursday, April 17. In a special meeting on March 23, SNESup also decided to go on another nation-wide strike but has not decided when. Their statement calls for an open dialogue between contractual teachers and the government regarding the teachers’ demands, particularly to increase the wages of researcher-teachers especially because of the high cost of living.

Rabat – Algeria’s powerful National Army senior officer, Ahmed Gaid Salah, has called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down and for the Constitutional Council to implement Article 102, allowing for the removal of an incapacitated president. Salah, who was Bouteflika’ closest ally, said on Tuesday, March 26, in a speech broadcast on state television that the way to solve Algeria’s “crisis” is to apply Article 102 of the Constitution. “We must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework that is the only guarantee to preserve a stable political situation,” Salah said. Salah’s statement followed his comments earlier in March when he said that the military and the people share a “united vision” of their country’s future, where Bouteflika is not in power. While Bouteflika withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term on March 11, he insisted on delaying the April 18 elections, effectively extending his fourth term indefinitely. Bouteflika plans to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. Bouteflika’s party itself,  the National Liberation Front (FLN), rejected his idea to hold a national conference, telling Algerian television channel Dzair News that is no longer a “valid”one. Since February 22, hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting in the anti-Bouteflika demonstrations, including students, judges, lawyers, unions, and many others.

In their coverage of the visit, pro-Polisario outlets boasted about the US’ Senate being on the side of the “Sahrawi cause.” That misreading of the US position in the conflict came straight from Senator James Inhofe’s comments at a news conference after the delegation’s meeting with the Polisario leadership. A known devotee to the Polisario’s Western Sahara “cause” and the sitting chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Inhofe led the 17-member delegation which subsequently met with high-profile Algerian and Sahrawi officials, including the self-styled president of the Polisario-administered territories Brahim Ghali. “President Trump’s commitment to the freedom of this people that he will undoubtedly recover,” he said. Infusing his statements with the usual Morocco-damning tropes of “colonization,” “occupation,” referendum, and self-determination,” Inhofe said that his visit to the camps was a reflection of his struggle alongside downtrodden and disenfranchised Sahrawis for human rights and dignity. The US, the UN, and the entire international community, he explained, should wait no longer to make Morocco bow to international laws and principles. The “Sahrawi cause,” he explained, is one of rescuing a helpless people from the jaws of Morocco’s “colonial and repressive” regime. While the senatorial visit and the telling picture of the Inhofe-Ghali bromance did not pick up in Moroccan media outlets as expected, the Senator’s rhetoric is the kind of impetus that has been driving the pro-Polisario legions in the US and around the world. Buoyed up by perceived injustice, reported “daily violations of Sahrawi rights,” and a certain morality-flavored imperative to come to the rescue of the needy and the marginalized, the point of such statements is to increase the ranks of groups that self-describe as “Friends of Western Sahara.” Unchecked and readily believed, words and rhetoric such as Senator Inhofe’s become the center of gravity of the enduring appeal to save Sahrawis from “Moroccan colonization.” 
Evangelical activism When checked, however, does the Senator’s humanitarian-cloaked and liberation-energized plea hide something other than a principled commitment to helping the needy and the oppressed? Is Inhofe’s engagement on similar fronts consistent with his professed disinterested adherence to “self-determination and independence for Western Sahara?” The answer, according to scores of studies on US evangelists’ decades-long involvement with Sahrawis, is that the Senator’s fervor for Western Sahara has more to do with performance and ideology than principles. While the urge to assist and help is commendable on many grounds, Inhofe’s activism in favor of the Tindouf camps is the culmination of a perceived deal with the Polisario leadership. The suggestion is that, as a die-hard Evangelical Christian, the Oklahoma Senator is throwing his political weight behind the “Sahrawi cause” in order to help the decades-long Evangelical overtures in the camps—and the Sahrawi imaginary. The allegation is heavy, perhaps even discourteous; it supposes that Senator Inhofe’s indictment of Morocco’s Western Sahara position is more about ideological posturing than genuine protestation. But such allegations are not without precedent. Over the years, researchers have used expressions like “holly humanitarianism,” “disaster evangelism,” or faith-based humanitarianism, among the most widely circulated, to explain the presence in Western Sahara of religion-driven donors and sympathizers like James Inhofe. Since establishment in 1976, the Tindouf camps have exclusively depended on material and financial assistance from the UN-linked organizations and a number of secular and faith-based NGOs. Documenting the ways in which donors navigate the needs of Tindouf refugees, a number of studies have nearly unanimously established that “Holy humanitarians” have historically engaged in activities other than providing assistance. Although religion can be a true “cataclysm for change,” anthropologist Marisa O Ensor remarked in her study of what she termed “disaster humanitarianism,” Evangelicals’ interest in “helping the victims of wars and natural disasters… has sometimes led to a form of bribery, promising material advantages to those who embrace the Gospel.” In the Western Sahara context, the Polisario leadership “ingratiates themselves” with Evangelists, green-lighting the former’ desire to establish churches in the camps and asking in return that they lobby in their favor in the US and on the international stage, according to Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, who has conducted some of the most insightful studies on the politics of Western Sahara-related humanitarian assistance.  The apparent deal between zealous evangelists like Senator Inhofe and the Polisario Front,” as Fiddian-Qasmiyeh put it in a 2012 working paper, is underpinned by each party’s avowed desire to advance its own interests. The paper documents Inhofe’s role as one of the most prominent figures among Western Sahara’s “American brothers and sisters,” groups of US evangelists who have organized numerous events in favor of the “Sahrawi cause,” including collective prayers and worship concerts. What’s in it for us? While UN and secular humanitarians generally limit themselves to discharging their duties as assistance providers, Evangelical humanitarians go beyond the primary goal of humanitarianism, coupling material assistance with spiritual and religious comfort. Rather than an instance of disinterested and unconditional support to “the Sahrawi cause” its proponents purport to fiercely espouse, evangelism-inspired assistance workers see in the Tindouf camps a fertile ground for proselytizing their faith. Help, therefore, is provided in the hope of medium to long term rewards: Conversion to Christianity of as many Sahrawis as possible. With “implicit and explicit conditionalities attached to the provision of aid,” Fiddian-Qasmiyeh wrote in another paper, assistance first and foremost follows the ideological priorities of the donors. Inhofe, a key member of the mainly Republican-composed US Senate Defense Forum Foundation known for its pro-Polisario sympathy, has no qualms about lobbying for the pro-Polisario claims at the US Congress. Referring to one of his numerous visits to the camps, Senator Inhofe said before Congress in 2009, “I strongly support the independence movement of the Saharawi people of Western Sahara, which demands the fulfillment of a 1991 United Nations resolution calling for a referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara.” He went on to invoke alleged human rights abuse by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara, brandishing his total adherence to the principle of “self-determination and the right to return.” The problem with the senator’s position, or the obvious religious underpinnings of his human rights-saturated discourse in the Sahara context, is that he loses his ardor for international law principles when taking stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Unlike in Western Sahara, where the UN Security Council does not refer to the disputed territories as “occupied” and where there is disagreement over who “the authentic Sahrawis” are, there is a fairly robust agreement in the Palestine-Israel case over the status of Gaza and the West Bank. Speaking at the US Congress in 2002, however, Senator Inhofe voraciously lamented any UN “imposition” on Israel to depart from a land that is “its historic right.” In a speech filled with overtly biblical references, the senator went on to give “7 reasons why Israel is entitled to the land.” This remarkable change of discourse, experts have argued, boils down to the fact that it is ideology—religious or political—rather than adherence to human rights principles, that governs the politics of Western-Sahara bound humanitarian assistance in many circles. Fiddian-Qasmiyeh describes this practice as “selective inclusion,” implying that, in many instances, humanitarian assistance—financial, material, and logistical—is provided insofar as the recipients adhere to the politico-religious conditions imposed by the donors. Another pro-Western Sahara recruitment trope in Evangelical circles is the religious idealization, or romanticization, of the Tindouf camps. In the evangelical vocabulary, Tindouf is not only a site with people in need of external succor. Rather, it is a non-Christian place incredibly welcoming to Christian ethics and values, which also makes it a place where Christianity can establish itself and potentially thrive. Chief in this narrative is the perception that despite its authorities’ insistence on religious tolerance and a history of peaceful accommodation of faiths other than Islam, Morocco is far from being a bastion of inter-faith dialogue. The resulting idea is that Christianity will only thrive in Western Sahara when it is not part of Morocco, where Islam is the overwhelmingly dominant and visible religion. This was much obvious in March 2010, when Morocco expelled hundreds of American and European Evangelicals for proselytizing to orphan and abandoned children under their care in the village of Hope in the Fez region. Covering a similar incident in May of the same year, Christianity Today observed: “Six years ago, a delegation of evangelical leaders visited the Kingdom of Morocco and hailed it as ‘open to evangelical Christian outreach.’” With the expulsion of Christian missionaries, however, the outlet concluded, “The North African country is apparently open no more.” A 2004 feature article in the Christian Science Monitor hammered that point home in a far more telling pro-Polisario rhetoric. “Literacy and democracy are thriving in an unlikely place,” the article observed, referring to Tindouf camps. It added that the Sahrawi women are the “most liberated women of the Muslim world.” But that literacy and democracy thrived was merely the tip of the iceberg, according to the Christian Science Monitor, in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps’ espousal of values closer to those of Christianity. Enshrining religious tolerance and an individualistic approach to Islam, the camps are places where “mosques are conspicuously absent.” The reason for the absence of Islamic symbols in the camps, the article went on to argue, is because the majority of Sahrawis “don’t believe that to speak to God you need a fancy place.”
Even more important, one Sahrawi translator allegedly told the Christian Science Monitor reporter, each Sahrawi “has his own Islam.” Few things are as close to Evangelists’ hearts and view of religion as interpretations that put each believer’s individual relationship with God at the heart of the religious experience. The Polisario Front understands this, and has heavily capitalized on it. According to Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, the group frames its discourse in line with its perception of its supporters’ priorities and “normative preferences.” When dealing with American evangelists, the group foregrounds its tolerant and secular approach to religion. Meanwhile, Fiddian-Qasmiyeh notes, “the Polisario habitually centralizes Islam in interactions with Algerian authorities, whilst displacing Islam and mobilizing notions of shared experiences of colonial oppression and racism to secure support from the Cuban and South African governments.” Toward an end of the Western Sahara conflict? There has been a mounting impetus for a frank political dialogue to settle the Western Sahara dispute under the auspices of the UN Security Council. For the first time in decades, the UN-led process to settle the dispute has convinced Algeria and Mauritania to take part in negotiations and peace talks as full participants in the trust-building and settlement discussion process. The four stakeholders are just coming out of a UN-led roundtable in Geneva. UN diplomats have expressed resurging confidence in a prospective end to the dispute, despite perceptions that longstanding ideological fervor may obstruct the newfound optimism. As ideologies tend to simplify complex realities, ideologized accounts of any crisis, much less one as complex and historically multifaceted as the Sahara dispute, often tell partisan truths, reinforcing listeners or receivers’ already entrenched biases. “Western Sahara is and has always been part of Morocco….The ‘Sahrawi people’ does not exist. It is the creation of Algeria and a large part of the Spanish left which are still not ready to come to terms with the fact that the territories are Morocco’s,” Spanish politician Jorge Verstrynge Rojas, who is close to pro-Polisario circles in Spain, recently commented. Rojas’s point, as he went on to highlight, was that, in the Sahara crisis, a clash of competing ideologies and revolutionary zeal has finally sidelined historical validity, throwing it in the dustbin. As much as ideologies inform knowledge and decisions, they also obfuscate, oversimplify, and sometimes confuse otherwise straightforward matters. As history is twisted and facts become mere tools at the service of one’s own truth, Rojas seemed to suggest, Morocco still has a lot on its public relations plate in a world where it has become fashionable—and virtuous—to come to the rescue of the oppressed, or the wretched, no matter how historically or factually invalid their claims are. In a global order that fetishizes revolution, history easily becomes a casualty of the urgency to do something about anything. Amid the confusion, Rojas and some other analysts have suggested, the most effective answer to Western Sahara’s long-standing stalemate lies in foregrounding both historical context and deft diplomatic maneuvering. For Rojas and those who think like him, there is very little prospect of sustainable settlement for Western Sahara so long as ideological and revolutionary outbursts whitewash historical relevance and factual evidence. Given the international community’s increasingly genuine desire to once and for all broker a lasting and mutually acceptable political solution in Western Sahara, a reading such as Roja’s may be overly pessimistic—and unwelcome. Whatever scenario one pictures, however, noted Francois Delattre, France’s Ambassador to the UN, brokering the necessary compromises will take time. “I think one of the lessons in diplomacy, and on this issue in particular, is each step at a time,” Delattre said during meetings to prepare the second Geneva meeting.

Rabat – Even without En-Nesyri, Hakim Ziyech, and Nordin Amrabat, three foundational elements in this Herve Renard-coached and somewhat good-looking Morocco, the Atlas Lions did produce a rather satisfying and confidence-boosting football against a Messi-less Argentina. But it is highly doubtful whether the quality of the game the lions produced will soothe Moroccans. Two consecutive goalless displays have brought to light what Morocco Atlas Lions mostly seem to lack: A sense of urgency and the guts to grab the defining moments when given the opportunity to do so. If anything, tonight was a hugely underwhelming performance from both sides, leaving supporters from both camps disappointed that a game that had garnered so much passion and so many talking points was after all not as stellar as supporters may have hoped. There was nothing particularly soporific about the 90 minutes of football in Tangier, but neither were there moments of ecstatic display that could live up to the pre-match fervor and excitement. With most of the ball possession and a far greater passing accuracy, Morocco looked set for an upset, something that seemed quite doable given that Argentina were clueless and unthreatening without the genius of Lionel Messi. The first half hour, as though a carefully choreographed display from Morocco’s Lions latest game in Malawi, was rife with moments of confidence and promising brilliance. But that brilliance never really came. In the absence of Ziyech, Belhanda, Achraf Hakimi, and Ziyech’s Ajax teammate Masraf Azraoui took it upon themselves to unsettle Argentina, playing with a level of confidence and mastery that quickly eclipsed Argentina’s starring player Paulo Dybala. But, as was the case late last week when facing Malawi, Morocco failed to make its domination count, missing the few opportunities that came its way in the first half. The first half’s most telling moment came down the right flank at the 22nd minute. A succulent combination between Belhanda and Hakimi caused riotous uproar inside the Tangier stadium, with Moroccan supporters obviously expecting a goal. But there again, once inside the Argentine zone, the Lions lacked the clinical edge needed to transform that beautiful footballing moment into a goal that would define the evening. Argentina replied in kind at the 24th minute, with a short-ranging strike from Rodriguez forcing the game’s first save from Morocco’s Yassine Bounou. But Argentina’s Roja were mostly unimpressive in the game, visibly out of ideas and inspiration, and perhaps waiting for an unlikely moment of grace. Passes were poor, while transitions were even more laughable. Without Messi, it seemed, Argentina plays like an ordinary team barely able to threaten its opponents. In the players’ defense, however, the weather may have been responsible for some of the game’s most lackadaisical displays. With an unruly, windy weather that made it impossible for many players to perform at their usual level, it is understandable that the game went the way it went: prosaic, awful, uneventful, and only marginally exciting towards the end. Of particular relevance here is the second half: Nothing remarkable, no outstanding moment. It was not only an extension, but a literal copy of the first half. Morocco kept playing beautiful but inconclusive football, while Dybala and company continued looking clueless. At least that was the impression until the last ten minutes. Collecting a gracious pass at the 84th minute, Angel Correa, who moments earlier had entered the game in replacement of Paulo Dybala, crossed the entire Moroccan defensive line with a deft touch before lodging the ball inside the Moroccan net. Bounou read the soft strike’s trajectory, but could do little to save it. After that late-minute goal, Morocco looked rejuvenated, now chasing an equalizer with a tempo and urgency than they had not even come close to evincing for more than eighty minutes. As both coaches look forward to collecting the wherewithal needed for prospective victory in their continental tournaments, tonight was certainly a test of nerve for both teams. In that regard, it is sensible to suggest that both teams left tonight’s game with notes that may serve them well en route to the tournaments they are preparing for. Argentina needs a working formula to get the most out of Messi in probably his last Copa America, whereas Morocco, for all their brilliance in passing and keeping the ball, are miles away from the finishing line required to secure the continental crown that has not been theirs since 1976.

Rabat – King Abdullah II of Jordan will spend a two-day visit in Morocco at the invitation of King Mohammed VI, March 27-28. The Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery said that King Mohammed VI would hold official talks with his royal guest. Two years have passed since King Abdullah II visited Morocco and discussed with King Mohammed VI political developments in the Arab world and the terrorist challenges the region faces. The two heads of state also agreed on the importance of mobilizing the international community to find solutions to Middle Eastern conflicts, including Palestine. King Abdullah II was due to arrive in Romania Monday but he canceled the visit on Monday in protest against Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila’s plan to move Romania’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On Sunday, Dancila said she was “pleased to announce” that Romania would “move our embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel.” She made the announcement at a conference in Washington, D.C., held by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent and influential pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States. Romanian President Klaus Lohannis rejected the Dancila’s announcement, saying that he is the only one who has the authority to do so. According to Jordan News Agency (Petra), the Jordanian sovereign was supposed to participate in the Aqaba Meetings, which Romania had been planning to host in partnership with Jordan. A Jordanian-Romanian Business Forum had been also planned with the participation of private sector representatives from both countries. The agency also reported that the Jordanian and Romanian governments had planned to sign one agreement, two memorandums of understanding, and a cooperation program. On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation to recognize Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights, a territory Israel seized from Syria in 1967. Trump’s decision received applause from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who commended the US for its decision at a joint press conference with Trump. Trump has been a close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu and recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017. Since then, a number of other countries followed suit, moving their embassies to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Both King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah of Jordan rejected Trump’s decision, emphasizing the status of the city as the future capital of the Palestinian state.

Rabat – The European members of parliament have voted in favor of ending the Daylight saving time (DST), with 410 voices in for and 192 against.  The vote results do not mean however that the EU countries will abolish the practice. Instead, concerned European countries will take it into consideration when making the decision. Since 2001, all EU countries have been using the DST, adding one hour on the last Sunday of March of each year and switching it back to standard time on the last Sunday of October. The goal of the practice of changing time twice yearly was to save energy. But studies have shown that DST has been detrimental to more damage to the health of people. Its contribution to increasing the amount of energy savings was marginal when compared with the mental troubles it caused among populations. The EU countries will now have the choice to whether stick with the summertime or keep the winter time. In Morocco, meanwhile, the daylight saving was supposed to end on Sunday, October 28, but Moroccans were taken aback by the government decision to stay in DST all year round. The move angered Moroccans who were used to move their clocks back by one hour every year on the last Sunday of October.  The government justified its move, saying that the decision was based on a study they conducted. The alleged study found that the “adoption of ‘doubling timing’ has created a kind of confusion,” according to the government. As 68 percent of Moroccans were against a permanent shift to using DST, the government explained that the decision is aimed to end changing time four times a year. Morocco goes back temporarily to GMT during the holy month of Ramadan. In recent months, speculations ran wild that Renault, and not the Moroccan government, was behind Morocco’s decision to maintain GMT+1. In a comment on LinkedIn, Chikhi Adib, the General Director of Altitude RH, a human resources consultancy, stated that Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn had come to Morocco to “personally demand” the permanent adoption of DST.

Rabat – It is unclear why the Algerian people waited for this moment to rise up, given that Bouteflika was already weakened by a stroke in 2013, and has been struggling to govern since.   Perhaps they were appeased by their relatively thriving economy which was heavily reliant on energy exports. Since oil prices began dropping drastically in 2014, Algeria’s reliance on oil has meant that its economy is becoming increasingly unsustainable.  The Algerian people are no longer willing to accept the paralysis of their leadership in the face of the challenges caused by the country’s stagnant economy, rising up in unprecedented numbers in recent weeks.  During the Arab Spring, a wave of anti-government protests that swept across the Arab world in 2010, the Algerian people did not demonstrate  for two main reasons.  The first reason is the scarring effects on the Algerian psyche of the Black Decade, a civil war between the government and Islamist rebel groups in the 1990s in which around 200,000 Algerians lost their lives.  The second reason is that political leaders  had promised democracy to the people once peace was achieved, but none of these promises were kept and although the people were well taken care of by the welfare state in terms of their basic needs, they had a dim view of the future and their aspirations were dulled by the limitations of what the state could offer them. Read Also: ‘Game Over’: Anti-Bouteflika Protests Resume in Algeria It is widely believed in Algeria that Bouteflika is a puppet of the military regime that governs Algeria with an iron fist. This regime finds its roots in the Liberation Army, which led the war of liberation against French colonialism.  After independence in 1962, the army withdrew from the political scene and gave revolutionary and socialist soldier Ahmed Ben Bella the opportunity to form a government and become the country’s first president.  Emboldened by the army’s trust and confidence in him, Ben Bella quickly forgot where the true power lay, and his flippant decisions soon antagonized Boumedienne, a heavyweight of the military, as well as his protégé, a young Bouteflika. In 1965, Boumeddienne seized power through a coup and brought the army to the forefront of the political scene, an institution whose leitmotif was and still is: “the use of revolutionary violence, if necessary, to remain in power.”  The Algerian army, unlike in the other countries of the region, functions like a powerful secret club headed by forty senior officers that rule the country behind the scenes. In 1991, the army’s dismissal of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), an Islamist political party who were victorious in the first round of parliamentary elections, pushed the country into a bloody civil war which is still known as the Black Decade.  In 1999, the army called on Bouteflika to get rid of the Islamist party by peaceful means. The secret of the ruling army’s longevity is undoubtedly their ability to bow and bend in order to eventually achieve their aims.  With the fall of Bouteflika, the army is continuing in this vein, making concession after concession to manage the Algerian people’s demands and unshakeable will. Their continued mass demonstrations have led the army to agree to withdraw Bouteflika’s candidacy, but the withdrawal has simply led to more political deception: In any case, the Algerian people will no longer stand for a government that doesn’t serve them. Doubtless, the mass protests are likely to continue in the face of the military’s undemocratic rule until Algerians have a government that they feel truly represents them.  Now, only time will tell if they will succeed in changing the face of Algerian politics and bringing about real change.

Rabat – The lawyers of Hassan Ennaciri, a Moroccan man living with his family in Spain, have denounced a Spanish court’s decision to expel him for drug dealing. The Spanish Provincial Court of Teruel in eastern Spain ordered the expulsion of Ennaciri, a Moroccan father of three, after he was sentenced to three years in jail in 2016 on charges of selling cocaine and “endangering public health.” In the same year, a court changed the sentence and ordered his expulsion from Spain, which it only implemented on March 9. According to one of the lawyers, Antonio Perez, Ennaciri’s family was shocked to learn on Monday that authorities took him from the Foreigners Detention Center (CIE) in Valencia, eastern Spain, toward Algeciras—a city in southern Spain connected to Morocco by passenger ferry. Ennaciri was transferred in compliance with an “immediate” expulsion order although he had appealed the earlier 2016 expulsion order. Ennaciri’s current whereabouts are not known yet. The lawyers deemed the court’s expulsion order abrupt and “illegal” because the court did not expel him within the first two years of making the order and did not review his case. Meanwhile, sources in the Valencian government delegation told Spanish news agency EFE that authorities originally made the expulsion order at the request of Ennaciri himself who had chosen to replace the three-year prison sentence with expulsion. Born in Morocco, Ennaciri had lived in Alcala de Xivert, a town north of Valencia, since 2004. He is a father to a two-year old and two girls aged 5 and 7, reported the news agency. Spain is home to 1 million Moroccans, according to EFE’s recent statistics. In 2018, the country issued a total of 220,929 visas for Moroccans, making them the third most likely non-European nationality to obtain a Spanish visa, after Russia and China. As for citizenship, Spain is tightening its procedures for Moroccans to get citizenship in the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. The Spanish left-wing Movement For Dignity and Citizenship (MDyC) party indicated last month that throughout the past 14 years, only 2,300 people were granted citizenship in the enclaves among a total of 1 million foreign residents there.

Rabat – A recent study from the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) found that social media is contributing to irregular migration from the Maghreb region. The European dream has been a goal for many young people living in the Maghreb region, including Moroccans. The study said that Maghreb migrants in European countries often share posts on social media, depicting Europe as a safe place and with better socio-economic opportunities than their home countries. “Through daily or weekly video blogs and other social media posts, Maghrebi emigres in Europe offer a mostly romanticised representation of the continent,” said ISS. Migrants returning for vacations in their home countries also represent Europe as a dream land. “Through social media this message reaches a bigger pool of youth, including those with little first-hand exposure to the European diaspora,” reads the study. ISS shows that access to the internet has become easy in Maghreb countries, especially in Tunisia,  Morocco, and Algeria. “Sixty-three percent of Moroccans and Tunisians, and 53% of Algerians are online, with many using inexpensive smartphones to connect.” Focusing on internet access in Morocco, the study found that the average Moroccan spends nearly three hours on the internet daily. Read Also: Report: Migration, Mobility Key Elements of Morocco-EU Partnership Social media, according to ISS, also offers migrants ways to reach Europe through lists of migration routes, crossing points to avoid, prices for “different forms of crossing, useful cover stories, and information on the degree and form of counter-migration enforcement used by security forces in both the Maghreb and Europe.” “Posts also cover strategies on how to regularise one’s legal status – or, at the very least, avoid deportation – once in Europe.” The study quoted a Moroccan video, which advised possible irregular migrants to “claim to be underage, claim to be Libyan, claim to be looking for your father” once in Europe. “In the videos’ comments sections, the information becomes more specific: phone numbers of smugglers and the specific dates, times and locations of groups planning to cross. This information is generally unfiltered and uncensored, and is continuously updated and corrected,” warned the study. ISS called on Maghreb countries to engage and cooperate to solve migration issues in the region. “Rather than seeking to stymie social media discussions on migration, governments should see this as a valuable opportunity to understand the factors and frustrations that drive their citizens to depart for Europe.” The study confirmed that  migration content is “likely to continue to grow rapidly” on social media since the number of Maghreb youth migrating to Europe “continues to increase.” “This will create an expanded group of network influencers ready to share their stories and offer advice.”

Washington, DC – While the Western media and academia keep referring to the PJD as an “Islamist party”, Moroccan voters and the public at large have dropped this label in describing the political faction. In fact, the PJD, that had its share of scandals, has shown little “Islamic tendencies”. Thus, the narrative that the PJD is a religious organization ruling as a remedy to the unchecked powers of the “Makhzen’ in Morocco is null and void. For a long while the PJD and its former secretary general and prime minster Abdelilah Benkirane, enjoyed the backing of a sizable share of the Moroccan electorate. While it is true that a large number of voters supported the party for its religious discourse, others trusted that its leaders would be less corrupt and more attuned to the need of the population. Voters recognize the difficulties PJD leaders encountered in forming their first and second governments.  It is not easy to direct ministers, secretaries of state, agencies, many of whom have their own loyalties and agendas. The PJD came to power with no experience of governing but had plenty of time to learn and gain skills in governance.  Seven years into their ascendancy to the premiership, Mr. Othmani and his party can’t get things done suggesting that their failure isn’t merely lack of experience but rather an absence of a program and a deficiency in experts and managerial personnel. It was a challenging environment at first, no doubt. Nonetheless, after two mandates in office, Moroccans expected to see better quality healthcare, improved public school and lower unemployment. Moroccan voters put the PJD in the government hoping to see improvements in key sectors such as public education, health care and employment. Unfortunately, the party has been unable to follow up on policy details or even draft legislation to try to pass in the Parliament. PJD’s leaders including Benkiran, Othmani, and the current Minister of Justice and Liberties Mustafa Ramid had plenty of time to recover from their early blunders when they formed their first government. However, after years in office and no major achievements, the PJD led government seems to have little legitimacy and looks weak and ineffective. The result is that even after seven years of rule, the PJD failed to deliver on the promise of a better life for Moroccans, especially the less fortunate ones. International observers love to judge the PJD in the broader context of the experiment of Islamists parties’ ability to rule. However, the voters in Morocco view the PJD like any other political organization in the nation.  Since there are no reliable opinion polls in Morocco, social media turn into the medium to gage the extent of the PJD’s government approval rating. Popular websites become the source to go to in order to read the public’s mood and feel the citizens’ pulse. Indeed, recent posting on news sites capture a somber mood and Pessimism about the future among Moroccans including the middle class. There is a feeling among the public that the PJD has not contested the powers behind the pockets of corruption and mismanagement that persist in some corners of the Moroccan society. Furthermore, the dreadful state of public education and healthcare sectors are examples of PJD’s policy impotence and incompetence in running a government. The Othmani team would remain feeble, hesitant, and irresolute, and Moroccans are convinced now that the PJD will not fight for them. Articles in the local press show evidence of an overall erosion of public confidence in the PJD government while other political parties find themselves, also, less popular now than during the last parliamentary elections. As the government struggles to show off significant achievements or display major successes, Moroccan voters’ reservoir of goodwill and excitements for the ruling PJD seem to dry out. PM Othmani’s chances of an electoral win in next parliamentary election in 2020 seem slim.

Rabat – Anas Doukkali, Morocco’s health minister, said that there are many clinics and private hospitals that sell medicine at higher prices than the set prices.  Doukkali issued a warning note last week, announcing that the health ministry had conducted an investigation and found that many private hospitals break the law by charging higher than the regulated prices of medical products. The minister promised to sue and penalize the private health institutions and clinics. Doukkali also promised to reinforce the monitoring of drug prices.  According to Doukkali, the clinics take advantage of the absence of supervisors at medical storage cabinets, stressing that every clinic should appoint a pharmacist who is certified by the ministry to supervise the medical supply and the prices of medical products. Hospitals then must provide receipts to patients, and the receipts should reflect the same price as the product’s original price. Raising prices of medical products is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of MAD 800, according to the Moroccan medical law concerning the responsibilities of medical professionals. In February, the ministry announced major cuts to the regulated prices of 319 medicines, including blood derivatives, antibiotics, and treatments for anemia, hemorrhaging, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. The decision was to facilitate citizens’ access to medicines under the provisions of the 2019 Finance Bill on the exemption of Value Added Tax or TVA for medicines that cost more than MAD 588 ($61). The Moroccan government promised Moroccans to improve access to health services and health coverage.

Rabat – Representatives of imprisoned Moroccan Salafis have raised concerns about the “failure” of the country’s de-radicalization programs, complaining that “the government has not kept its promises.” One argument has become familiar for Morocco experts and observers: Since the Casablanca terror attack in 2003, Morocco has heavily invested in counter-terrorism and de-radicalization programs. In addition to its world-renowned anti-terrorism elite police units, Morocco has devised plans to combat extremist discourses via education and rehabilitation. Rabat has since been described in a slew of reports as North Africa’s bastion of counter-extremism and de-radicalization. Yesterday, however, members of organizations representing extremism-linked inmates raised their voice about their growing “lack of trust” in the country’s new de-radicalization programs. They particularly protested the government’s unwillingness to deliver on a March 2011 agreement with representatives of formerly and currently imprisoned Salafis. The agreement, signed on March 25, 2011, entailed promises such as reduced prison terms and improved detention conditions. The deal involved over 1,200 inmates to whom the government promised mitigation of prison sentences and smoother rehabilitation. In return, the inmates promised to “fully subscribe” to the government’s de-radicalization vision and ease the task of rehabilitation workers. Abderrahim Ghazali, the spokesperson of the Coordination of Salafi Inmates, said the government has failed them. “Eight years later the results are mixed. The government has not kept its promises.” Of the 1,200 mainly concerned with the March 2011 agreement, 85 are serving “harsh sentences” for links to the 2003 Casablanca bombings, according to Ghazali. Also concerned with the agreement, he explained, are nearly 500 returnees from former ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria as well as members of extremist cells dismantled during DGSN or BCIJ raids across Morocco. Having obtained what it wanted, Ghazali elaborated, the government is no longer showing any willingness to have dialogue. He said, “Right now there is no dialogue between the government and Salafi inmates. All they offer us these days is the Moussalaha Program.” The Moussalaha reconciliation program is a 2017 initiative launched through collaborative work between security services; extremism experts; the National Council for Human Rights (CNDH); and the Mohammedia League of Scholars or Ulemma, Morocco’s highest body of Islamic clerics. According to Moroccan authorities, the program is a “comprehensive de-radicalization plan” with four axes of intervention: Religious re-education, courses on human rights and civic duties, psychological assistance, and socio-economic assistance. While authorities describe the program as “incredibly successful,” Ghazali said that Salafi inmates he spoke with “have no faith in Moussalaha and refuse to subscribe to it.” The news comes amid concerns over the degree of success of Morocco’s de-radicalization strategy. In February, a study from the US Carnegie Institute Endowment for International Peace established that there is an alarming rate of recidivism among released Moroccan jihadis. While Rabat has been successful in dismantling terrorist cells and preventing terror attacks, the same cannot be said of the country’s de-radicalization strategy, the study found. It established that “despite Rabat’s sporadic efforts to deradicalize jihadis while they are in prison, the policy remains unable to reintegrate them after they have been released.”

Rabat – Observers are questioning who will replace the ailing Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as the original date for the 2019 presidential election, April 18, is around the corner, although Bouteflika has promised to postpone it. All Africa reported that the Algerian government “might force Bouteflika to resign and instal the head of the Senate, Abdelkader Bensalah, to serve as interim president for 45 days.” However, Bensalah’s Moroccan origin is problematic for some Algerian politicians. The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, argued that Bensalah, speaker of Algeria’s National Council, cannot replace Bouteflika until elections as an interim president because he was once Moroccan. In a television broadcast, Benkhellaf said, “The popular movement [in Algeria] demands the immediate departure of the president. He can do this either by resigning or by applying Article 102 of the Constitution.” Article 102 stipulates, “Whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” Benkhellaf said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he [Bensalah] had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality,” said the Algerian MP. Benkhellaf added that Bensalah’s former nationality “poses a problem.” According to Article 87 of the Algerian Constitution, candidates are ineligible for the presidency if they have a foreign nationality. To be eligible, candidates should have solely Algerian citizenship from birth and prove that his/her parents were also born with Algerian citizenship.  Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has been running the country as since 1999, was born in Oujda, a city in northeast Morocco on the border with Algeria. Benkhellaf ’s comments on Bensalah’s nationality implies also the long-standing tension between the two countries on a number of regional conflicts, including Western Sahara and the closed border. Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994. Algeria made the decision after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Algeria is witnessing waves of protests, called “Hirak” or popular movement. The protests began against Bouteflika’s decision to campaign for a fifth presidential term and are continuing against his decision to postpone the 2019 election, suggesting that he aims to indefinitely extend his fourth mandate.

Rabat – Approximately 30 American universities will participate in the “Study in the U.S. Fair” at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Casablanca and the Hilton Garden Inn in Tangier.  Students can attend the Casablanca fair at 5 p.m. on March 27 and the Tangier fair at 11 a.m. on March 30 to learn about study opportunities in the US. The US consulate in Casablanca is hosting the fairs in partnership with the US Department of State’s EducationUSA network. The fairs are an opportunity for Moroccan students wishing to continue their studies in the US to meet with 50 representatives from the American universities to get detailed information on the education programs offered by the universities. Moroccan students will also meet with experts from the consulate. According to the US consul general in Casablanca, Jennifer Rasamimanana, Moroccan young people are aware that openness to the world is a key factor to succeed. Rasamimanana made the comments on March 25 at the opening of the 2019 EducationUSA MENA Regional Forum in Casablanca. She further said in her welcoming speech to the universities’ representatives, “We hope that this opportunity to interact with American universities will increase the number of Moroccan candidates.”  Rasamimanana noted that the US hosts more foreign students than any other country with more than 1 million international students yearly. EducationUSA is an international network of the Department of State with more than 430 academic orientation centers in 180 countries. Its main mission is to provide international students with accurate information about study opportunities in the US.

Rabat – The African Ministerial Conference on the African Union’s Role in Supporting the UN-Led Political Process in Western Sahara has issued its final declaration unanimously supporting the AU’s Decision 693, which reaffirmed the UN as the only authority to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. The conference met in Marrakech this week. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared a statement listing the fundamentals of the final declaration approved by the 37 African states attending the conference, including Morocco. The 37 African countries, according to the ministry, agreed to welcome the “unanimous adoption” of the AU’s Decision 693 adopted in July 2018 at the 31st AU session in Nouakchott.  The decision pushed back against the efforts of some African countries to mediate the Western Sahara conflict under the auspices of the AU by affirming the UN-led political process as the only legitimate institution to find a mutually agreed upon solution to the Western Sahara conflict. At the Marrakech conference, the African states also agreed to “preserve the spirit and the letter of the 693 Decision.” The countries also believe that “any initiative to undermine the substance of Decision 693 could undermine the credibility of the partnership process and their contribution to the achievement goals of our continent.” Nigeria, which recognized the Polisario Front in 1984, also attended the conference and signed the declaration, a testament to Moroccan diplomatic gains. Notably absent from the meeting were Mauritania and Algeria, both involved in the UN-led political process in Western Sahara.  The Marrakech event also aimed to counter an event hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity meeting this week in South Africa. Algeria and several southern African countries are attending the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi People in Pretoria, meeting March 25-26. South Africa and Namibia are hosting the event. Algeria, South Africa, and Namibia, hostile to Morocco’s sovereignty over the region, have long held links with the separatist group of the Polisario Front, supporting their independence claims. The symposium seeks to emphasize that the “solution of Western Sahara should be based on the principle of self-determination and decolonisation.” The Southern African Development Community (SADC) symposium marked the attendance of Algeria’s foreign minister Ramtane Lamamra; and Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa; Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni; and the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali. On Monday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita criticized hostile actions inside the African Union from Polisario’s supporters. The official said that the Decision 693 of the AU should be “neither reinterpreted, nor circumvented nor instrumentalized” because it enshrined the exclusive competence of the UN.

Rabat – Morocco is sending four senior athletes to the 43rd World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, on March 30. One of the athletes is Abdalaati Iguider, 32, a seasoned middle distance runner who has represented Morocco in various championships since 2004. Iguidor won bronze at the London Olympic Games and the IAAF World Indoor Championship title in 2012 for the 1,500 meters. In 2015, Iguider became the eighth fastest ever to run the 1,500 meter at the Herculis Diamond League in Monaco. Rababe Arafi, 28, will also be competing in Denmark. An outstanding athlete, in 2018, Arafi was the only athlete to secure a double victory at the Mediterranean Games in the women’s 800 meter and 1,500 meter. Arafi also earned three medals at the African Championships in Athletics in 2012.  A steeplechase runner, Soufiane El Bakkali, 23, is the third senior athlete on his way to Denmark. He secured first in the 3,000 meter steeplechase race in 2018 in Spain and won second place at the African Championships in Asaba, Nigeria, the same year. Kaoutar Farkoussi, a 23-year-old long-distance runner, rounds out the senior Moroccan team. The Royal Moroccan Federation of Athletics (FRMA) announced the runners on its website. In preparation, the athletes are undergoing an intensive training period in Ifrane, a city in the Middle Atlas Mountains known for its ideal atmosphere for athletes, according to Anfas Press. Although FRMA is only sending four senior athletes to Denmark, it has a more robust junior squad. Eleven junior athletes, five boys and six girls, will be at the start line of the world championship.  Morocco hosted the World Cross Country Championships twice, in 1975 and 1998.  Future prospects for Moroccan athletes In retired professional runner Hicham El Guerrouj’s view, the situation of athletics in Morocco has become dismal. Morocco enjoyed a formidable reputation in running in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to professional athletes like Hicham El Guerrouj, whose trailblazing trajectory, along with the prowess of Nawal El Moutawakel, Said Aouita, and others, is still a source of pride for Moroccans. A retired Moroccan track and field Olympian, Said Aouita, now 59, won gold in the 5,000-meter at the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1987 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and won gold in the 3,000 meter at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships.  Called the Moroccan sportsman of the century, Aouita set five outdoor records for the 1,500-meter, 2,000-meter, 3,000-meter, 5,000-meter, and two miles. He also set a record for the indoor 3,000 meter.  After Aouita began losing ground to Algerian athlete Noureddine Morceli in the 1990s, El Guerrouj, a middle-distance runner, won Morocco’s pride back. El Guerrouj still holds the world record for the outdoor 1,500-meter, 1 mile, and 2,000-meter events. He also held the indoor world record for the 1 mile and 1,500-meter events from 1997 up until February and March this year.  The first Moroccan to win a world championship medal after Said Aouita, the now-retired 44-year-old El Guerrouj is regarded one of the best middle-distance runners globally. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was the first to win  both the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter at the Olympics since 1924. In a nine-year span, El Guerrouj competed in 68 1,500-meter races, winning 63 of them. Nawal el Moutawakel, 56, made history for Moroccans after winning her first medal in the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 in the 400 meter hurdles, making her the first Arab, African, and Muslim woman—and the first Moroccan athlete male or female—to win a gold medal at the world stage in that event. According to Jeune Afrique magazine, she was also ranked among the 50th most influential African personalities in the world in 2014. In an interview with Radio Mars, Hicham El Guerrouj expressed despair at the condition of athletics in Morocco earlier this year. Especially for those coming from lower social classes, El Guerrouj said they are not given the opportunity to showcase their talents. “Today, the reality is that [Moroccan] athletics is going from bad to worse, from failures to even more failures, and as a result generations of athletes are unfortunately lost,” el Guerrouj stated. “Today athletes don’t even have places to change or take a bath, this should be punished. I call on King Mohammed VI to save [Moroccan] athletes.”

Rabat – An engineering teacher at the Hoofdvaart College vocational school in Amsterdam has received a temporary suspension for calling the Prophet Muhammad a “pedophile.”  According to Dutch education minister Arie Slob, the 49-year-old teacher had discussed Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), telling his students that the prophet is seen as a “pedophile” in the Netherlands. The teacher’s comments, made in January, had offended students, and they reported him to the school board for “insulting religion.” The school suspended the teacher and the story reached the lower house of the Dutch Parliament. Slob said in a written parliamentary statement—after his ministry sent a commission to inspect the college and speak to the board, students, and teachers—that the teacher’s suspension was justified. He also informed the lower house that it is temporary. The teacher’s lawyer, Wilco Brusse, criticized Slob’s statement as “extremely careless,” reported Dutch news outlet De Volkskrant. The lawyer explained that the ministry’s commission was biased because it did not question the teacher during its investigation and never considered his version of the story. “As a result, my client’s reputation is now tarnished,” Brusse said. In an interview with the Volkskrant, the teacher denied having made the statement and insisted that he respects other believers. Muslims in the Netherlands are witnesses to several forms of Islamophobia, experiencing both verbal harassment and physical violence. One of the recent instances of Islamophobia was against a mosque earlier in March.  The German Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) group attacked a mosque in the Netherlands by hanging a banner with an obscene message insulting the prophet next to a mannequin dressed in traditional Arab male dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint. Provocations at mosques are not uncommon in the country. Last summer in Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, Pegida led a series of offensive acts on mosques by roasting pork, considered impure in Islam, in front of mosques to provoke Muslims. The world is still mourning the March 15 terror attacks on two mosques in New Zealand, which killed 50 Muslims.

Rabat – The US State Department has approved the sale of 25 F-16 fighter jets to Morocco for $3.8 billion. The US also agreed to approve of Morocco’s purchase of upgrades for the 23 F-16 aircraft it already has, for $985.2 million. The military deal, according to Defense News, is Morocco’s second largest purchase from the US after a November 2018 agreement for new Abrams tanks. On November 29, the US State Department announced that it had approved a deal to enhance 162 Abrams tanks with machine guns and rounds for an estimated cost of $1.259 billion for Morocco. Morocco aims to upgrade its military capability as well as enhancing interoperability with the US and other partners. Morocco buys most of its arms from the US. Between 2014 and 2018, Morocco received 62 percent of its arms from the US, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In addition to the US, France is also a major supplier of arms to Morocco. Despite Morocco’s efforts to upgrade its military, Algeria has a more powerful military. In its latest reports, SIPRI ranked Algeria among the top five importers of major arms in the world between 2014-2018. The Global Firepower Index (GFP) ranked Morocco’s military power 61st out of 137 countries globally for 2019. GFP said that Morocco has 1,109 combat tanks, 800 artilleries of three different types, and 2,270 armored fighting vehicles. The report also mentions that the country holds a “Power Index” rating of 0.8244 in which 0.0 is “perfect.” Morocco also has 346,000 military personnel in total: 196,000 active personnel and 150,000 reserve personnel. According to Global Firepower, Morocco has 291 total aircraft, including 61 fighters, 16 attack planes, 31 for transports, and 79 trainers. The country also has 72 rocket projectors. The report lists zero submarines, 3 frigates, and 81 patrol vessels. The report estimated Morocco’s defense budget at $3,400,000,000, but lowered Morocco’s score because of its large debt to international countries.Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt, according to the report.

Rabat – The United Nations has commented on US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Israel’s authority over Golan Heights. In a press conference, the UN Secretary-General’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said on Monday that the UN’s position “has remained unchanged from last week to today.” Dujarric added that it is “clear that the status of Golan has not changed. The UN’s policy on the Golan is reflected in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and that policy, again, has not changed.” On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation officially recognizing Israeli authority over Golan Heights, a territory on the Israeli-Syrian border. Trump said, “Today I am taking historic action to promote Israel’s ability to defend itself.” In a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump remarked, “This was a long time in the making.” He added that the decision should have been made “many decades ago.” Israel took control of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981, a move the UN did not recognize as legal. In reference to a missile attack from Gaza into Israel that injured seven on Monday, Trump said: “We do not want to see another attack like the one suffered this morning north of Tel Aviv.”  Netanyahu described Trump’s decision as “historic justice” and a “diplomatic victory.”  “Israel won the Golan Heights in a just war of defense,” he added. Prior to Trump’s proclamation, several countries condemned Trump’s decision to recognize Israel’s authority over the region. “The recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, occupied territory, would be contrary to international law, in particular the obligation for states not to recognise an illegal situation,” the French foreign ministry said last week. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised to take the issue of Golan to the UN. In December 2017, President Trump announced a controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The president also moved the US embassy from Tel  Aviv to Jerusalem. The decision received international backlash. King Mohammed VI was among the world leaders who condemned the action.

Rabat – Award-winning French director Michel Ocelot is working on an animated film featuring Morocco and Turkey, reported UK-based news outlet Middle East Online (MEO) on Sunday. “The starting point is Morocco … in the 18th century,” Ocelot told Middle East Online at the Meknes International Festival of Animated Cinema (FICAM) taking place from March 22 to 27. The film “depicts… a female doctor who has been listening to tales orated by female storytellers in the palaces where she has been working,” he explained. Ocelot said that cinema can be a powerful inspiration for good or bad. “The guy who committed the massacre in New Zealand did a cinema. The cult of weapons is also a cinema art. I’m sure that when we make a violent movie, it inspires people to kill,” said Ocelot. “People, however, become noble” when they watch “noble” movies, he added. Ocelot said that animated cinema in Morocco needs some work to make it appeal to a global audience while preserving local taste. “The danger is to try to sell Moroccan animated cinema abroad and lose the identity.  You have to be both Moroccan and international,” he said. Ocelot is a self-taught director who kick-started his career in animation movies with the 1998 animation film “Kirikou and the Sorceress.” Last month, Michel Ocelot won the Cesar for Best Animated Film for his film “Dilili in Paris” at the 44th Cesar Award ceremony. Ocelot will present the film at FICAM 2019. “Dilili in Paris” shows the exploitation and enslavement of women at the turn of the 20th century Belle Epoque. “The harm men do to women is worse than wars. We should talk about this taboo,” Ocelot said. FICAM was founded in 2001 and has been under the patronage of King Mohammed VI since 2018. The Aicha Foundation is responsible for its production and the French Institute of Meknes provides artistic direction.

Rabat – An individual used an accelerant to set fire to a mosque at 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning, March 24, in Escondido, southern California.  The arsonist also left behind offensive graffiti on the wall referencing the terror attack on two New Zealand mosques on Friday, March 15. Police did not reveal the content of the graffiti, but commented that the “graffiti left behind by the suspect made reference to the shooting incident in New Zealand.” According to the Escondido Police Department, seven people were inside the mosque at the time of the blaze, but none of them were injured. The incident happened more than two hours before the early morning fajr prayer. The seven in the mosque used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire before police and firemen arrived. The fire only slightly damaged the exterior facade of the mosque. Escondido police Lieutenant Chris Lick said that the suspect used an accelerant to set the fire. Police have not identified any suspects and are investigating the incident as arson and hate crime. The police are getting assistance from fire investigators, a regional bomb/arson task force, and agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Since the New Zealand attack, police have increased surveillance in Escondido by deploying patrol vehicles at every corner in order to help the Muslim community feel safe. Police in Escondido encouraged locals to report any suspicious activity near mosques and urged the Muslim community to stay vigilant and watchful at their prayer centers.

Rabat – More than 10,000 of young Moroccans made their voices heard internationally as they flocked to Rabat to protest the government’s alternative decision regarding their status as contractual teachers throughout Saturday night and Sunday morning. The teachers, who describe themselves as “forcibly contracted educators,” decided to camp out in front of Parliament on Saturday night to show their determination. Anti-riot police used water cannons and police motorcycles to disperse the protests.Some teachers also said there was “violence” during the protests. Some video clips and pictures showed faces covered in blood. The government has hired teachers under annually renewable contracts every year since 2016.To fill the need for more teachers while managing heavy public debts, the government hired the teachers through regional academies. The contractual teachers, who are not officially part of the public sector, receive the same salary, starting at MAD 5,000 ($520) monthly, as teachers who are permanently on the government payroll but have reduced pensions. Teachers have not held up their end of the contracts they signed, the government said. Minister of Education Said Amzazi issued a statement earlier this month, explaining that teachers were informed of the contracts’ conditions before signing them.But contractual teachers are demanding equal treatment to their public sector counterparts. Oussama Hamdouch, a 27-year-old member of the National Coordination of “the Forcibly Contracted Teachers,” spoke to Morocco World News about their demands and loopholes in the contracts. Hamdouch said that the situation of the teachers has reached a critical and decisive moment. “We are in a battle” Hamdouch, who became a teacher when he signed a contract in 2018, said that the government has offered to change 14 articles of the contracts as a compromise. He said that the Ministry of Education offered to change the teachers from “contractual teachers” hired under fixed terms to full employees of the regional academies of education. The offer was unacceptable, teachers said.Regional academies do not have the ability to adopt all teachers, Hamdouch said. “They lack the human and financial resources teachers need.”Morocco’s regional academies are not autonomous institutions and receive funding from the Education Ministry. “The academies will be able to fire teachers if they don’t have financial resources whenever they want to. School principals will also have a certain authority over us. We want to work with dignity like the other teachers in the public sector,” Hamdouch told MWN. Among the working conditions the contractual teachers are complaining about is the pension system. Teachers working under contracts will only receive 40 percent of their monthly salary after retirement. If they receive MAD 10,000 while working, the teachers will receive MAD 4,000 monthly after retiring. Debts, politics drive the issue Hamdouch said that contractual teachers signed the contracts because they were not offered better job opportunities. “We had no choice. The job market is disappointing.” Explaining why the group representing teachers calls themselves “forcibly contracted teachers,” Hammouch said, “If the government wants to increase the prices on gas cylinders, there will be protests, but people will buy anyways because of their need and lack of options.” In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance announced a joint decision to recruit teachers through contracts  to offer job opportunities, to meet a need for teachers, and to improve human resources in education. The Ministry did not respond to our calls for comment. The unemployment rate in Morocco remains high, despite the slight year-on-year decrease from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP). Morocco continues to borrow from international firms to complete socio-economic and infrastructure projects and cover its budget deficit. HCP estimated that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP in 2019.
Several senior officials have warned that rising external debt could negatively impact Morocco’s economy. In 2018, the governor of the central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, Abdellatif  Jouahri, said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2019, up from 13.8 percent of GDP in 2018. He added that he refused to apply in 2016 when the government was looking for 10,000 candidates. “I did not have a choice in 2018; I applied because there are no other options.” One condition of the contract specifies that the teachers cannot seek to become public sector employees in the education sector for the duration of the contract, a key demand of the protesting teachers. Good health coverage, bad pay According to the contracts, teachers’ salaries can increase depending on the employee’s pay grade. But the ministry did not respect some of the conditions in the contracts, teachers say. The government should increase the salary for the contractual teachers by MAD 100 annually. Every two years, the ministry should offer qualifying exams to evaluate the performance of teachers which could allow them to move to a higher pay grade. Another teacher speaking on condition of anonymity, however, acknowledged that the teachers are offered good health coverage. “The government introduced employment under fixed term contracts because of pressure from the World Bank,” Hamdouch said. To handle mounting debts, the government has reduced its payroll obligations. “The contracts make teachers feel unstable, disappointed, and deceived, he said.

Rabat – In remarks at an AU conference in Marrakech, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has spoken about the importance of the AU’s adoption of Decision 693 and its support for the UN-led political process on the Western Sahara conflict. The decision was adopted at the 31st AU in July 2018 in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Bourita made his remarks at the opening of the African Ministerial Conference on the African Union on Monday. According to Bourita, the decision “contributes to strengthening serenity within the AU regarding the Moroccan Sahara issue.” He argued the decision should be “neither reinterpreted, nor circumvented nor instrumentalized” because it enshrined the exclusive competence of the UN to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The decision also prevented a parallel process to that of the United Nations and stressed the AU’s support for the UN-led efforts. The conference in Marrakech is convening representatives of 37 African countries from the five subregions of Africa. The chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, released a report in July 2018, stressing the AU’s support of the UN-led political process to end the conflict in Western Sahara.

Rabat – Essaouira and Shengzhou, a city in eastern China, signed a memorandum of cooperation on Friday, March 22, to promote friendship, cooperation, and exchanges of experience in areas such as tourism, culture, transport, the environment, and digital technology. Hicham Jabari, the mayor of Essaouira, and Yan Gang, the mayor of Shengzhou, signed the agreement at the first International Shaoxing (Shengzhou) Green Tea Conference.  Trade between China and Essaouira dates back to the 18th century, when Chinese tea arrived in Essaouira and then was distributed to other ports in Morocco and West Africa, Jabbari said. Jabbari also mentioned other cooperation prospects for Essaouira, one of Morocco’s most popular beach cities. “We are thinking of the city of Essaouira as an ecological city, and we are thinking of a framework for cooperation to lead to the adoption of electric buses” in Essaouira. In a speech at the opening of the conference, Mourad El Ayachi, Morocco’s deputy ambassador to China, welcomed the signing of the memorandum. El Ayachi stressed the importance of developing economic and cultural interactions between the two cities, improving mutual exchanges and creating conditions for “win-win” cooperation. He also referred to the long-standing friendship between the peoples of the two countries, which dates back to the 14th century, during the visit of the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta to China. Morocco, the world’s largest importer of green tea in 2017, accounted for 25 percent of the total export volume of the tea industry in China, according to Moroccan news outlet Medi 1.

Rabat – After submitting a request to UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee to add Gnawa music to its Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list, Morocco has made a similar request for tbourida, a traditional horse festival, also known as the Moroccan fantasia. The Moroccan Ministry of Culture and Communication announced on Monday that it had prepared and submitted the file for tbourida in partnership with the Moroccan Royal Society of Horse Encouragement (SOREC). The move is part of the ministry’s project to promote Moroccan culture abroad. The ICH list seeks to enhance visibility for the traditions of communities but does not set standards of excellence or exclusivity. “Tbourida is a major component of horse-related sports … It is an art deeply-rooted in the Moroccan culture and associated with both national and regional festivities,” stated the ministry. Tbourida, which is known internationally as “fantasia,” is a type of horseback riding in which equestrians fire guns and ride in synchrony. It is a colorful exhibition usually held during seasonal festivals known as “moussem”or other cultural and religious festivals. Tbourida is a historical practice in the Maghreb region, depicting the strong relationship between the man and the horse. To preserve and promote the Moroccan Gnawa art, which is a combination of spiritual or ritual poetry and dance, the ministry registered it for the ICH list on February 21. UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) will consider adding Gnawa music and tbourida to its ICH list at its 14th session on December 9-14, in Bogota.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) has reported that its 2018 revenues jumped by 15 percent to MAD 55.9 billion over 2017.  OCP group gave the figures in its annual outcomes report for 2018 on Monday. The group said that the positive result was supported by demand for higher volumes and higher prices for both phosphoric acid and fertilizer. Volumes and prices remained stable for phosphate rock. “These positive results further strengthened the Group’s position as the largest global exporter of phosphate fertilizers, while it has maintained its market-leading positions in phosphoric acid and rock,” wrote the group in a press release. OCP reported that in 2018 fertilizer revenues grew by 20 percent compared to 2017 and represented 55 percent of its total revenues, an increase from 45 percent in 2014.  The growth in fertilizer revenue is explained by higher demands globally. North America imported 24 percent of OCP’s exports, Latin America 23 percent, Africa 22 percent, Asia 16 percent, and Europe 15 percent. Rock and phosphoric acid each represented 18 percent of OCP’s total revenue. OCP exported the majority of its phosphoric acid, sales of which grew 39 percent, to Asia, Latin America, and Europe. OCP said that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), were MAD 17.1 billion in 2018, up by 34 percent from 2017. The company reported that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2018 were MAD 11.3 billion, up by 71 percent from 2017. By the end of 2018, OCP’s net financial debt was MAD 35.2 billion, down from MAD 43.9 billion in 2017. The leverage ratio was 2.02. OCP predicted that 2019 will be prosperous with increased demand and consumption led by a stronger spring application season in North America, improved weather conditions in Europe, a pick-up in Brazil, and higher demand from Africa.

Rabat – New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has tasked a royal commision with making a top-level inquiry into whether security services could have prevented the March 15 terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch. Jainda told reporters on Monday, “It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to how this act of terrorism occurred and how we could have stopped it.”  She also ordered the royal commision to produce a “comprehensive” report. The commission will look into ways to prevent terror attacks from happening, the accessibility of semi-automatic weapons, and social media’s role in the attacks. On March 15, a 28-year-old Australian attacker filmed himself shooting Muslims inside two mosques in Christchurch. The attacker killed 50 people and injured 50 more. The incident generated condemnation and shock across the world. Recently, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) spoke with several members of the Moroccan community in New Zealand who expressed fear over the terror attack. Moroccan businessman Taoufik El Idrissi said that “all New Zealanders, including members of the Moroccan community, are in a state of shock, and no one is close  to forgetting this terrible day.” “We were leaving our doors open in a country … where we thought to be far from all the evils of the world,” he said. He added that the lives of all people have “changed” since March 15. “We need a lot of courage to overcome this ordeal,” he added. El Idrissi said that he wanted to show solidarity with the victims by traveling more than 300 kilometers from the city of Palmerston to Christchurch to be alongside other members of the Muslim community. Another Moroccan member of the community, Ahmed Belghashi, said he was only a few kilometers from Al Noor Mosque during the attack. “I was working at the bank when we knew the terrible news of the terrorist attack.” He said the atmosphere at the bank was sad. “The members of the Muslim community feel anguish they have never experienced in New Zealand. The peace that prevailed in this peaceful country no longer exists,” he added. Adil Bennani, another Moroccan, said, “The faces changed and the smiles on New Zealanders’ faces disappeared.”  With tears and a cracking voice, Bennani said, “We have lost dear friends in these attacks.” Reports said that the victims of the attacks were aged 3 to 77.

Rabat – Algerian politicians are warning of an economic crisis, as revenues from Algeria’s oil and gas exports are dropping. “The debate is now focused on politics, but the real iceberg is the risk of an economic crisis in the next couple of years and no one has a strategy to tackle this,” said Riccardo Fabiani, an Algeria-focused analyst at the London-based research institute Energy Aspects.  According to Fabiani’s analysis, Algeria’s foreign reserves are falling quicker than anticipated and they “probably have less than two years of import cover left.” As Europe’s third-biggest natural gas supplier, Algeria’s fuel exports bring in more than 95 percent of its foreign currency.  Meanwhile, employees at energy firms are responding to online calls to strike and join the mass protests. Officials fear a strike could threaten energy exports. The CEO of the country’s state energy firm, Sonatrach, said last weekend that while employees have the right to join the protests, they should first fulfil their duties and keep working. Last week, employees in several oil and gas corporations went on strike nationwide, joining the demonstrations against their ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Protests are still ongoing in the North African country, and Bouteflika’s party itself rejected his plan for a leadership transition. Although he withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term on March 11, Bouteflika insisted on delaying the April 18 elections, effectively extending his fourth term indefinitely. He has called for a national conference to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. Bouteflika’s party rejected his plans for a national conference. The National Liberation Front (FLN) told Algerian television channel Dzair News that the conference idea is “no longer valid” because unelected figures would participate in it, and Algerians do not want it. When Bouteflika announced the conference, Algerians bitterly accused him of trying to “trick” them into ending the protests without achieving their aims.  Demonstrators then took to the streets to start further protests, denouncing the president’s failure to let go of power and demanding that he leave at the end of his current term on April 28. Demonstrations across the country started on February 22 and are the biggest Algeria has experienced since the Arab Spring in 2011.

Rabat – A driver harassed and attempted to run into two veiled Muslim women while they were picking up their children from school on Friday, March 22, in Uccle, Belgium. The two Muslim women, Nabila and her sister Kautar, were at a pedestrian crossing when the driver began to swear at them and make Islamophobic comments, before attempting to hit the women with his car.  He then sped off. The women were able to write down his license plate and make a formal complaint to the police, who arrested the attacker not long after. Nabila told the Brussels Times, “In the ten years that we have been here, we have never experienced any problems. I’m still in shock.” However, this is not the first incident of its kind in Belgium. In December 2018, a veiled woman of Moroccan origin walking down the street with her 10-year-old daughter was punched in the face. A CCTV camera captured the incident, and the woman could be seen falling to the ground screaming after the attacker ran off.  In 2018, the Collective against Islamophobia in Belgium (CCIB) provided further insight into Islamophobic attacks in Belgium. In a report, CCIB revealed that they had opened 90 investigations into Islamophobic attacks in 2018. Seventy-six percent of the victims were women.  The collective estimated that an Islamophobic attack occurs once every two days in Belgium on average. They also found Islamophobia is most often expressed in the media and on the internet (29 percent), in general society (17 percent), in education (16 percent), and at work (14 percent).

Rabat – After deliberations between the government and fuel distribution companies, the minister delegate of public affairs and governance, Lahcen Daoudi, stated on Sunday, March 24, that the government has reached a final decision to regulate the price of fuel. After a final meeting between the government and the Moroccan Petroleum Group (GPM) which represents fuel companies on February 19, when fuel company representatives said regulation was reasonable, the companies have reportedly agreed to conform to the government’s final decision. According to Daoudi, there is no disagreement between fuel companies and the government so far on the principle of oil price regulation. “I have accomplished my mission and will hand my report to the head of government in order to put the agreement into practice in the near future,” said Daoudi, whose ministry has been negotiating with fuel companies. Daoudi said that fuel companies had no option to block the regulation of oil prices, but some companies’ opposition made the decision difficult. The government has been firm about regulating fuel prices despite the criticism of the Council of Competition, which described the move as unnecessary. The council said it “would harm industry stakeholders.” In mid-December 2018, Daoudi, whose ministry regulates pricing, gave in to demands to regulate oil prices following complaints about the large profits companies had made in a two-year period. An MP of the Democratic Left Federation party, Omar Balafrej, described the profits of fuel companies, which he estimated at MAD 17 million, as “unethical.” “This [profit] would not have happened if it were not for the Council of Competition being frozen,” Balafrej argued. He further asserted, “This huge amount of money would ensure that all Moroccan students benefit from free transport.” He questioned why politicians have not talked about seizing companies’ legal profits. “It’s strange that none of the MPs or heads of parties have raised the issue of retrieving the 17 billion dirhams,” he said. “It’s not a ‘trivial’ amount.” In 2015, the government liberalized the prices of fuel. According to one MP from the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Abdellah Bounau, fuel companies tripled their profits from MAD 300 million to MAD 900 million. Bounau chaired a committee of inquiry into oil prices last year.

Rabat – After Mozambique launched an international call for emergency aid following the deadly Cyclone Idai on March 14-15, Morocco sent 93 tons aid which landed on Sunday. Abdelali Rahali, the Moroccan ambassador in Maputo, Mozambique, received the aid yesterday from the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). FAR delivered 200 tents, 2,000 blankets, and foodstuffs, according to the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. On the occasion, the Mozambican minister of agriculture and food security, Higino De Marule, thanked King Mohammed VI for his humanitarian gesture in a time of need, expressing that his country was “not surprised by the gesture because the Moroccan and Mozambican people are united.” De Marule emphasized that the Mozambican people—especially those who are still in the affected area, need all the support they can get, including food, medicine, and shelter. The situation in Beira, a major Mozambican city on the Indian Ocean where Idai hit, noted the minister, is improving thanks to international aid and the efforts of Mozambican contributors. For his part, Ambassador Rahali affirmed that King Mohammed VI’s gesture reflects the strong and sincere ties keeping Morocco and Mozambique together.  Mozambique’s Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia told reporters last Saturday, March 23, that the cyclone’s the death toll had risen to 446 from 417. He added that the cyclone affected 531,000 people, and 110,000 were in camps. Correia said on Saturday that some 1,500 people were still sitting in trees and on rooftops and needed immediate help, more than a week after the cyclone hit on March 14. Many died after falling from precarious perches. The floods have also raised water-borne diseases such as cholera, prompting the Mozambican government to open a cholera treatment center. Cyclone Idai, described by the UN as the most disastrous weather event ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, lashed Beira with winds of up to 170 kilometers per hour. The storm had developed in Malawi, moved out to the ocean, and after hitting Mozambique, moved inland to Zimbabwe, killing hundreds in its wake. Other countries that sent aid to Mozambique include Turkey, Portugal, and Tanzania.The European Union and Pope Francis also sent aid.

Rabat – Lebanon has refused entry to Moroccan journalist Nora Fouari after an immigration official noticed her passport bore a sticker showing she had visited Israel before. The journalist, who works for Assabah newspaper, took to her Facebook to express her anger over the situation. Fouari wrote: “Security services at the Rafic Al Hariri airport in Beirut prevented me from entering Lebanese territory because of a previous visit to Israel. I spent the night in a cold room with a Palestinian … who has an Israeli visa printed on her passport.” She added that the security services sent her to Istanbul after long hours of waiting and a “stupid investigation.” Once in Istanbul, the journalist spent a night “held” in a room with “undocumented migrants” and people arrested for forgery before returning to Morocco.  According to the journalist, her passport had a sticker instead of a stamp or official visa from Israel because Israeli immigration is aware that it can prevent passport bearers from traveling in some Arab countrie. “I forgot to remove a sticker that proves my journey in Israel from the back of the passport, and I had already entered another Arab country without any problems.” She continued, “The securityman at Rafic El Hariri Airport did not like me … he thought that I was showing off and in love with myself, and he was searching for something until he found the sticker. I had to keep laughing with him because he is handsome, and because I am Moroccan.” In another post, the journalist criticized Lebanese people who supported their country’s decision to refuse her entry. The journalist addressed “those who consider the ‘peoples of the Arab Maghreb’ to have provided nothing in the war against the Zionist enemy  …. we are proud of our identity, our culture, our civilization and our openness, and we thank God that we are far away from you geographically and intellectually.”  Criticizing the Lebanese government, Fouari said that Israel would not have found itself a home “without your treachery and conspiracies … We, here in Morocco, are happy to receive your citizens who live among us with dignity.” Fouari’s case is not the first time a Moroccan has faced consequences for visiting Israel.  An Arab women’s business council stripped Moroccan poet Bouchrail Echchaoui of an award she received in Lebanon after she visited Israel. The majority of Moroccans criticize any move towards normalizing diplomatic ties with Israel. Amid rumors that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was planning an official visit to Morocco, the Moroccan government received backlash from campaigners.  Journalists questioned Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi about the rumors, but he declined to comment.  Dozens of activists went to Parliament in Rabat to protest against any normalization of Moroccan relations with Israel in  February.

Rabat – As the only delegate from Morocco, 22-year-old Noureddine El Bakali competed against some of the most experienced debaters in the world at the six-day Harvard World Model United Nations (MUN) in Madrid March 17-22.  During the conference, El Bakali was part of a field of 2,000 delegates from over 110 countries. “It was a pleasure to be there and represent Morocco in such [an] important event, I’m doing what I love and I would like to help my country to develop itself in the future,” said El Bakali. El Bakali was born and raised in Al Hoceima, a city in northern Morocco, and began attending the Spanish Institute Melchor de Jovellanos when he was 5 years old. He is now studying political science and law at the University of Granada. This year, El Bakali is partaking in the Erasmus political science program at Sciences Po Bordeaux in France. El Bakali began partaking in MUN conferences in 2017 and has since attended five conferences. In 2018, he took part in a conference in Madrid representing Morocco where his committee debated Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. He has also acted as a delegate representing other countries, such as Spain, France, and South Africa. El Bakali told Morocco World News the reason he partakes in MUN conferences is to further his diplomatic skills. “Diplomacy is what I would like to do in the future, and I hope that it will be for my country Morocco,” said El Bakali. What is Model United Nations? MUN is an extra-curricular activity where students roleplay as delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. The purpose of the conferences is to provide students with opportunities and experience to debate and find resolutions to world conflicts. MUN conferences are held around the world at the middle school, high school, and university level. Harvard World Model United Nations is the world’s most internationally-diverse university-level MUN and the largest outside North America. Over 2,000 university students came to the conference from over 110 countries. The conference location changes between cities around the world every year. At the conference, El Bakali participated in a committee that roleplayed Spain’s governmental transition in 1975. El Bakali represented former Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez on the council of advisors of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. In his position, he advised the King of Spain during the transition following Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. Over five days of intensive debate, the committee wrote a new constitution and achieved democracy. Throughout the conference, El Bakali interacted, learned from, and formed relationships with students from around the world, including Venezuela, Tanzania, and Canada. “We achieved democracy. It was very intensive debating with others (sic) advisors from all political spectrum, but we managed to do it,” said El Bakali. Morocco and MUN As for Morocco’s role in the MUN, El Bakali was the only participant in the conference of over 2,000 delegates. “I would like to see in the future more Moroccans participating in these kinds of events because Morocco needs people who are prepared and MUN prepares us very well,” said El Bakali. El Bakali believes that MUN is a special experience where students can get exposure to competitive students with advanced debating skills. While Morocco hosted two MUN conferences in the cities of Agadir and Ouarzazate in 2019, MUN clubs and conference have yet to gain popularity with Moroccan youth.  “Morocco needs to invest more in political studies because at this moment I don’t see in Morocco the interest in politics as I see here in Europe. I would like to organise in the future a Model United Nations Conference in Morocco,” said El Bakali. “Moroccans are good at having relations with people from other countries and that’s very important in diplomacy,” he continued.  Petitioning the King of Spain Beyond taking part in the conference,  El Bakali also had the opportunity to meet several prominent political figures, such as Spanish Minister of Science Pedro Duque, President of the Community of Madrid Angel Garrido, and King Felipe VI of Spain. During El Bakali’s meeting with the King, he delivered a petition concerning the name of his hometown of Al Hoceima. The petition, written by El Bakali, asks the King to grant Al Hoceima the title of “villa.” The town’s name in the 1920s, “Villa Sanjurjo,” became “Villa Alhucemas” in the 1930s. The city’s name comes from the Spanish word Alhucemas, meaning “lavenders.” After Moroccan independence, the name was Arabized to Al Hoceima and followed French spelling. The Spanish King is the only person capable of granting the honorary title of “villa” to any city due to the historical and cultural significance of the title. According to Filipino historian Luciano P.R. Santiago, the title is a “territorial classification” which “comes with a coat of arms.”  El Bakali believes the name change could attract more Spanish and foreign tourists, since the symbolic title of “villa” is held by other important cities, such as Madrid. “I think that it would transform Al Hoceima into a precious city of great cultural interest,” said El Bakali. The name change “may contribute to the prosperity of the city’s tourism after suffering from economic recession with a lack of job opportunities,” he continued. In 2007, the mayor of Al Hoceima stated that all new houses would be painted blue and white in efforts to restore the city’s traditional appearance. Members of the town are seeking to boost tourism in the region, drawing on the historical significance of the region and its Spanish influence. El Bakali received support from his family and friends for the petition but has yet to receive greater support from the town. This in part may be due to a lack of understanding of the title’s significance. “I tried to speak and I sent messages to newspapers from my region, but they did not answer me. It’s sad for me and I’m a little bit disappointed,” said El Bakali. After delivering his petition directly to the King of Spain, El Bakali hopes his voice will improve the state of his community of Al Hoceima as well as inspire Moroccan youth to become interested in diplomacy.

Rabat – Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli stressed the need to strengthen Moroccan-Argentine cooperation on Thursday, March 21, in Buenos Aires. Morocco and Argentina need “stronger cooperation” to match their “excellent bilateral relations,” said Jazouli, who headed the Moroccan delegation to the UN High-Level Conference on South-South Cooperation from March 20 to 22. Jazouli called for joint action on a range of issues, including investment, trade, and business relations. Morocco and Argentina have several judicial agreements in the process of finalization, but cooperation should extend to the agricultural, livestock, and nuclear and renewable energy sectors, said Jazouli at a meeting with Argentine Deputy Minister for External Relations Gustavo Rodolfo Zlauvinen.  In the context of Morocco’s South-South agenda, Jazouli noted “a real need to support development in Africa.” He also cited the major implications of the continent’s demographic growth. The population of Africa is expected to reach 2.5 billion people, including 1 billion youth, by 2050. According to Jazouli, development is crucial to prevent “a real humanitarian disaster [ensuing from] migration, terrorism and … underdevelopment.” Morocco has made South-South cooperation a priority of its foreign policy, said Mohamed Methqal, the director general of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), on March 19 in Buenos Aires. Argentina supports Morocco’s territorial claims over Western Sahara and does not recognize Polisario. Last year, the South American country expressed its interest in entering into a free trade agreement with Morocco.  In 2017, Argentina exported goods worth $509 million to Morocco and imported goods worth $133 million from Morocco, according to World Integrated Trade Solution. The UN Conference on South-South Cooperation is the world’s largest South-South cooperation meeting. The conference’s setting is significant, coming 40 years after the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.

Rabat – Saturday night to Sunday morning, young contractual teachers decided to camp outside of Rabat’s parliament in protest of the government’s recent decision to keep contractual teaching positions. The teachers, aged 20-30, donned white coats and carried banners with slogans such as “the people for the abolishment of contractual employment” and “freedom, dignity and social justice” as they marched around Rabat during the day. There were approximately 10,000 protesters on Rabat’s streets, according to Reuters.  As night fell, the protesters marched from the Ministry of Education to the Parliament, where they lit candles and set up an improvised camp in front of Rabat’s parliament. Authorities initially attempted to negotiate with the contractual teachers, but when the teachers refused to leave after two hours, police and auxiliary forces used water cannons and batons in an attempt the disperse the protest. March 23 was chosen as the day for this large protest in reference to a mass student protest in Casablanca that occurred on the same date in 1965, which ended in as many as 100 deaths according to the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires (UNFP). The protest follows the government’s unwillingness to change the laws on contractual employment. Contractual employment doesn’t allow the teachers to seek a permanent position in the education sector, and they can be fired with 30 days of the contract being signed.  Contractual teachers are also only paid MAD 5000 month, putting in them in the government’s ninth pay grade. Many are protesting to receive a raise to the 10th pay grade, adding an extra MAD 1500 to their salary. Approximately 55,000 contractual teachers have been hired since the practice was introduced by the government in 2016. The protests began on March 3 and are showing no signs of slowing down. On March 10, the government tried to find solutions to ease the tension, such as proposing the contractual teachers by hired within the regional academy they currently work, but protesters said this was not enough and they would keep protesting until the contractual hiring of teachers was abolished completely. Government Spokesperson, Mustapha El Khlafi, in response to contractual teachers rejecting the government’s proposed solutions, said that the protests have “nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.”

Rabat – Speaking after the second roundtable discussions on the Western Sahara, Deputy Prime Minister of Algeria Ramtane Lamamra said Algeria reiterated the need to hold a meeting with the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU). Lamamra, who represented Algeria during the second roundtable discussion on Western Sahara held Thursday and Friday near Geneva, said that his country “made contributions regarding regional construction.” Commenting on the second roundtable, Lamamra said that the meeting emphasized the “continuation of efforts and hopefully with more concrete measures, more significant advances in this  [UN-led] process.” Lamamra implied that his country is still firm on its position that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Morocco and the Polisario Front only. Quoted by Algerian news agency APS, Lamamra said that the agenda for this second round table “was essentially based, first and foremost, on the need for confidence-building measures between the two parties to the conflict, Morocco and the Polisario Front.” He added that the meeting was also marked by “an exchange of views on the critical importance of building confidence between the two sides.” In several prior statements, Morocco has condemned Algeria’s unwillingness to shoulder its responsibility In recent years, the Moroccan government called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict, including in the alleged unbearable situation  of Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps. In November 2018, King Mohammed VI addressed a direct invitation to Algeria, offering a dialogue initiative to break the stalemate between the two countries. Through a speech addressed on the anniversary of the Green March, the King called for a direct and frank dialogue between the two countries. The lack of unity between the Maghreb countries is “an unreasonable situation” which contradicts “the brotherly bonds uniting” the peoples of Morocco and Algeria, according to the monarch. In addition to its position on the conflict, Algeria also ignores Morocco’s invitation to open border between the two counties. Algeria’s border with Morocco has been closed since 1994 after Morocco announced a new visa requirement for Algerians following the Marrakech terrorist attack thought, at the time, to have been perpetrated by Algiers.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba has left Morocco after a medical stay in Morocco to finish his recovery after suffering a stroke in October 2018 in Saudi Arabia. Bongo left Morocco on Saturday from the Rabat-Sale airport. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani greeted Bongo in the airport before his departure. Speaking about the Moroccan-Gabonese diplomatic ties, state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press said that Morocco and Gabon have “strong relations of friendship and solidarity, based on deep and historical bonds of fraternity between the two peoples and the two heads of state.” Throughout his stay in Morocco, Ali Bongo made two visits to his country to chair official ceremonies after a coup attempt. He then came back to Morocco to finish his recovery. On January 7, a group of Gabonese rebels seized the state-owned broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. The government managed to intervene and arrested the group of rebels, killing two of them. Bongo has been in Morocco since November recovering from a stroke he suffered in Saudi Arabia in October 2018.

Rabat – Morocco has never had as many media outlets as it has today. The emergence of thousands of news platforms, mostly digital, is something to be celebrated. That is especially so in a country where the media scene was for decades dominated by the state-run television and radio company and a handful of newspapers acting as the mouthpieces of political parties. But there are serious questions about how much this boom is affecting society, whether positively or negatively. Around 2010 and 2011, digital outlets were making their baby steps. At the time, privately owned newspapers and magazines had long dethroned papers run by political parties. Private radio stations also added a flavor of diversity to the broadcast sector after decades of monopoly by the state. Advances in technology; widespread access to the internet for Moroccans; and national and international political upheavals, especially the Arab Spring, helped online platforms to increasingly extend their share of the marketplace and paved the way for the birth of more outlets. Remote and marginalized areas, long forsaken by subsequent governments and media which mostly reported on events in the big cities where they are located, got their own local media platforms. Citizen journalism flourished. Ordinary people recorded what they witnessed and posted it online or cried out loud their grievances on YouTube or Facebook, often asking their countrymen to share their videos for awareness. Moroccans, from all walks of life, have probably never consumed more news. People share, comment, react, and express their opinions freely about political, social, and economic issues in their country. Social media has given them a power never known before. Whenever there is a hot topic in Morocco, articles are written about how people are reacting to it on social media. To get more readers and viewers to engage with their content, competition intensified between digital media outlets. Instead of the sometimes deliberate blackout of some sensitive issues by state-run media, as was the case with the months-long protests in the northern Rif region in 2016 and 2017, digital platforms were at the forefront. Taking sensationalism to another level All this leads one to believe that Moroccans are now more informed than ever before and that digital platforms have had a tremendous positive impact on society. But, is that so? One of the results of competition between digital outlets is a propensity to sensationalism. Sensational news has been the bread and butter of countless papers around the world, including Morocco. Still, online platforms have given it another dimension. In the 1990s, the audience of such papers was limited due to high illiteracy among Moroccans or the fact that these newspapers were less popular than more established ones whose focus was more serious political and social issues. “Serious” papers at the time, like Al Itihad Al Ichtiraki and Al Ahdath Al Maghribiya, sold thousands of copies thanks to sensational topics. Al Itihad published graphic accounts of the sexual crimes of Mohamed Tabet, the infamous police officer who abused his power to rape women and recorded his crimes in sex tapes. Al Ahdath’s “From Heart to Heart” section was a platform through which Moroccans expressed their emotional problems and sexual fantasies. The section was so controversial that many speculated some of what was published was not real but rather figments of the imagination of the newspaper’s reporters. According to a study by the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT) published in September 2018, around 19.6 million people have smart phones that they use to access the internet. When we look at the mounting trend in Moroccan digital media to publish sensational content, we understand that many people consume it. As the economic model of digital media is based on the number of clicks these platforms get, which allows them to get advertisement, outlets understood that the shortest cut to more clicks is sensationalism. The desire to be the first to snatch a soundbite whenever a scandal erupts or a crime happens leads these outlets to cross the lines of journalism ethics. For the love of clicks In late December 2018, Moroccans were appalled when an online platform posted an interview with a child describing how she found her mother decapitated. Social media users could not understand how a little girl, already struck by the loss of her mother and seeing her body mutilated, could be interviewed in front of camera. While the editor-in-chief of the outlet acknowledged the mistake and removed the video, the damage was already done. The child’s rights were violated. The video was seen by many. Others reposted it, which means that the harm will continue. In November 2017, a high school student in Casablanca slashed his teacher’s cheek open after school. The incident was one in a series of violent incidents across the kingdom in which teachers or students were victims. While it is clear nothing justifies the student’s crime, some digital outlets published sound-bites of his schoolmates, in which they blamed the teacher for what happened because she and her colleagues decided to transfer the student to another school. The interviews with those teenagers, even though they did not bring any insight to the story, reflects these outlets’ propensity to spice things up whenever there is a similar incident of a widely-publicized act of violence. This is exactly what some of those platforms did in August 2017 when six teenagers sexually assaulted a girl on a bus and filmed their crime. The media outlets added their own touch by interviewing people from the neighborhoods of the assaulters. The interviewees defended the assailants, saying they were “only having fun.” In both incidents, the outlets chose sensational quotes from their interviews as their headlines. They did not take the trouble to make sure that such behavior, whether committing a crime or giving lame justifications for it, is not condoned. This hardly seems an issue of freedom of opinion, too, as we were clearly dealing with cases of horrific violence. The way these media outlets published their videos and the fact that these were not isolated incidents give the impression that they do not care about the victims, freedom of expression, or, as a matter of fact, journalism ethics. All they seem to care about is more clicks. Less quality, less respect The boom in digital media led to the creation of countless platforms that hired un-trained, under-paid journalists who lack, according to professionals with more experience, the tools to produce good quality reporting. There is much that can be said about the quality of language published on those platforms. The increasing use of Darija (colloquial Moroccan Arabic) instead of Modern Standard Arabic in published content will only impoverish people’s vocabulary, especially the young generation, and will deprive them of tools that help them to read, digest, write, and discuss issues in the language of education and academia. The quality of language in a good number of media outlets bears no resemblance to that used by political-leaning newspapers of the 1990s or some of today’s privately-owned papers and magazines. Much also can be said about the videos posted by these outlets, from the poor quality of sound and light to editing or angles of filming. In sum, whether we are talking about media ethics, the quality of language, or the professional and technical aspect of journalism, Moroccan digital platforms have a lot of work to do to step up to the occasion created eight years ago: That of building a more diverse, open, and highly informed society aspiring for more democracy.

Rabat – Following months of rumors and speculation, FC Barcelona issued an official statement to announce news about Lionel Messi’s participation in the Morocco-Argentina friendly game. In a statement issued on Friday, the football club said that Lionel Messi “did not have the return to international action that he would have wanted, and an injury picked up on Friday night means he will miss Argentina’s game against Morocco” on Tuesday, March 26. The statement added that the “the FC Barcelona star captained his side and played the entire 90 minutes of the friendly against Venezuela at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid, but they would lose 1-3.” Speculation ran wild that the superstar set up several conditions after Argentina announced its plan to play a friendly match against Morocco. Some international outlets reported that Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) have to pay MAD 10 million to Argentina’s football association for Messi to play in Morocco. The alleged cost angered Moroccans, some of whom started a boycott campaign on Facebook recently calling for the match to be suspended and the money to be used to improve the lives of those in need. The match convening Morocco and Argentina will serve as preparation for the Atlas Lions for the coming Africa Cup of Nations championship in Egypt, planned for June 15 to July 13. The game will take place in Tangier.

Rabat – Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has criticized contractual teachers, who are protesting to demand permanent employment. Benkirane spoke about the importance of work in Islam, which considers working hard as an act of worship in itself. The former Head of Government made his remarks in Taroudant, a city near Agadir, where he was visiting a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). “We have problems in health and education, that is true. But, we can improve education sector performance by 90 percent,” Benkirane said.  Other sectors can also be improved by 90 to 100 percent through making efforts and hard working according to Benkirane. Commenting on the protests, Benkirane said that the concerned teachers will be held responsible for their duties the same way they would be held accountable for not respecting one of the most important fundamentals in Islam, such as prayers and fasting. “I left the education sector in 1988, and I acknowledge in front of God that I was not the best professor I could have been,” he said. Morocco, according to Benkirane, is a good country. “If you compare it to other countries, our country is way better.” “We want a better Morocco, this is why his majesty the King [Mohammed VI] said that ‘something has been missing.’ This means that we are not how we are supposed to be. We need to be good and direct. If everyone is committed to their roles, everything will be alright,” said the former Head of Government. Contractual employment of teachers by contracts was introduced in 2016, when Benkirane was still a Head of Government. The announcement came after a joint agreement from both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance in October 2016. The agreement stipulates that regional education academies have the right to hire teachers on a contractual basis in order to promote human resources and to curb shortage of teachers in Morocco. The contracts, according to the government, do not allow the concerned teachers to apply for a permanent position in the education sector for the duration of the contact. Benkirane concluded his statement by advising contractual teachers to make further efforts to promote the sector and to help improve their country. “If you are telling me the minister or the ministry are responsible [for these issues], what will you gain? Whatever the program looks like, if you perform your duties and teach people sincerely, it will be beneficial,” he added. His comments generated critical remarks from internet users who questioned his role in Morocco’s politics. “Who are you Benkirane, and in what capacity are you  speaking? You no longer have a role in the political arena,” said one citizen. While Benkirane advises teacher to commit themselves and provide concrete services, the secretary-general of the Istiqlal Party Nizar Baraka said that the “government is evading responsibility for the situation of contractual teachers.” The former minister said that the contract adopted by the government is “characterized by legal fragility, as it has nothing to do with the public employment or the labor law.” Baraka called on the government to end recruitment through contracts and to improve the the situation of the concerned teachers.

Rabat – Hundreds of contractual teachers dressed in white coats while marching with banners to voice anger over the government’s decisions on Saturday night in front of the Parliament. The protest, which continued after midnight, was surrounded by several vans of police and auxiliary forces who used water cannons to disperse the protesting teachers.  The teachers continued their demonstrations despite law enforcement’s approach. The protesters held several banners and chanted  slogans such as: “social justice, freedom, and dignity” and “people want to bring [temporary] contracts to an end.” The protests followed statements made by Minister of Education and Vocational Training Said Amzazi and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, who reaffirmed the government’s unwillingness to abandon employment by contract. While the government calls the protesters “contractual teachers,” the demonstrators have described  themselves as “forcibly contractual teachers.” What’s in the contracts? Contractual employment in the education sector was introduced in 2016, when the country’s government was still run by former head of government Abdelilah Benkirane. On November 1, former Minister of Education Rachid Ben Al Moukhtar Ben Abdellah announced that regional educational and training academies are able to employ teachers via contract, in accordance with Joint Decision Number 7259, convening Ministry of Education and Ministry of Economy and Finance. One of the conditions of the contract is that regional education academies have the right to terminate a contract within 30 days of sending notice to the teacher. 
The teachers, who are required to have a  university degree, can be hired on a contractual basis  after oral and written tests and one year of field training. According to the document signed by the former minister, contracts sought  to strengthen human resources. The decision came as an attempt to solve the teacher shortage as a matter of urgency and to curb unemployment. A condition of the contract specifies that  the concerned teachers are not allowed to seek a permanent position in the education sector after signing the contract.  The contract requires  teachers to undergo a training period. The contracts can also be renewed for one year after training. The documents also state that employees will receive a monthly salary similar to what teachers in the public sector receive: starting from MAD 5,000. Contractual teachers have rights to promotion and pension, in addition to maternity leave for female teachers, public holidays, and summer holidays. The teachers, according to the document, have the right to “social protection,” which enables them to enjoy several benefits, including the ability to participate in  health coverage managed by the “general cooperation of national education.” Why are they protesting? Contractual teachers argue that they are not afforded as many benefits as those in the public sector, especially concerning retirement. The teachers are requesting  permanent work contracts. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said the government recruited teachers by contract with the aim of  “improving the regional academies as public institutions with administrative and financial autonomy and controlling their human resources.” Amzazi also added that the recruitment of teachers based on contracts is an “irreversible  strategic choice,” the teachers were informed of all the clauses contained in the contract they signed and committed themselves voluntarily. On March 9, the minister announced that his ministry might consider abolishing employment under fixed-term contract, giving contractual teachers more benefits. The contractual teachers, however, refused the minister’s offer as they are seeking concessions from the government. The protesters’ objection was followed by a statement from the government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khlafi, who said that the protests have “nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.” One teacher told Morocco World News, “We cannot make concessions on our rights. We have to fight for them.” He added, “It’s our constitutional right to stage strike as long as the government refuses to open a dialogue with us and solve this issue together.” Teachers are also threatening further protests, announcing that they would push for a “blank year” or anné blanche of striking from work in defiance of the government’s warnings. It remains to be seen whether the government will offer any further amendments to its decisions regarding the situation of teachers.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested on late Thursday five foreign nationals holding Israeli passport for collaborating with a network forging Moroccan IDS, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced shortly after the arrest. According to the statement, the suspects have links with the Moroccan birth documents-forging network, which Moroccan authorities dismantled earlier this month. While investigations are still ongoing, it is understood that the DGSN has reasons that network is spearheaded by Moroccans, including a Moroccan Jew, who have been active in selling fake Moroccan IDs to non-Moroccan Jews. Two of the suspects apprehended on Thursday are not new to the business of document- falsification, according to the DGSN statement. The two are believed to have links with similar networks in countries other than Morocco. Both are subjects of Interpol red notices for aerostation and extradition. One is thought to be linked to human and drugs trafficking networks, while the other is believed to have been implicated in homicides and related organized crimes at the international level. After searching the suspects’ homes, the police found large sums of money including in national and foreign currencies; a considerable quantity of hashish, fake Moroccan IDs, and many telephones and other electronic gadgets. The five suspects are currently under police custody as authorities continue investigations to shed further light on the document-falsifying network.
The news comes amid hectic Morocco-Israel relations. In the past months, there have been talks of Israel demanding compensation for Moroccan Jews who lost properties during World War II. There were also reports of perceived diplomatic normalization between Morocco and Israel. In the first half of the 20th century around World War II, there were as many as 260,000 Jews in Morocco. While that number has considerably dwindled over the years, the North African country is still widely believed to have not expelled its Jewish communities, nor dispossessed them of material and financial resources. Around 10,000 Moroccan Jews live in Morocco to this day, according to official estimates.

Rabat – Having kept a low profile until now, a number of Moroccan Christian associations want to use the much-publicized pope Francis visit to demand the institutionalization of their religious rights. The groups’ spokespersons say they want to “be both Moroccan and Christian.” A “tiny minority in an overwhelmingly Muslim country,” Reuters reported on March 22, Moroccan Christian converts see in the pope’s visit an opportunity to convey their demands in the country’s highest places. Jawad El Hamidy, the head of the Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms, told Reuters that while “foreign Christians” are visible and free to exercise their religious rights, Moroccan converts are barred from fully embracing their religion. “We want laws that protect religious minorities in the country on an equal footing. We will seize the pope’s visit to put more pressure on the state to protect religious freedoms,” he said. Hamidy’s association has reportedly addressed the Vatican a letter to denounce Morocco’s alleged discrimination of its Christians. The group is said to be planning to organize sit-ins on the eve of Pope Francis’ visit. The Coordination of Moroccan Christians, another group raising concerns over Morocco’s treatment of Christian converts, said they wanted to take advantage of the pope’s visit to “to launch a sincere dialogue on religious freedom for Moroccan citizens.” But Moroccan authorities have dismissed the groups’ claims, arguing that Morocco does not violate religious freedoms. “There is no persecution in Morocco and there is no discrimination on the basis of faith,” Reuters quoted government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi as saying. Earlier this week, Moroccan Archives in collaboration with the Council of Moroccans Residing Abroad (CCME) organized an exhibition to showcase Morocco’s history of religious tolerance and peaceful cohabitation between Moroccan Muslims and Christians. Under the theme “Christian Presence in Morocco: Living Together,” the exhibition aimed at “throwing a retrospective look on some unknown episodes of a shared history filled with strong values of forbearance, peace, and living together,” according to organizers. But beneath that image of Morocco as a bulwark of religious tolerance and enlightened inter-religious values, the country’s Christian groups claim that Moroccan laws are skewed in favor of Moroccan Muslims. “When I went to a church to declare my faith, I was told that I was prohibited to do so by Moroccan law,” a 40-year old Moroccan was quoted by Reuters as saying. During his two-day visit on March 30-31, Pope Francis will meet with Morocco’s King Mohammed VI as well as the country’s growing migrant and Christian communities. The pope’s program in Morocco put a particular emphasis on the celebration of a culture of diversity and religious tolerance.

Rabat – As a young American woman studying in Morocco, I received many messages of concern regarding the murder of two young Scandinavian tourists in December. Following the attack, family and friends in Morocco and the United States alike told me to be extra vigilant of my surroundings, warned me to stay far from areas deemed “dangerous,” and expressed their concern for my safety.  While I was slightly concerned for my own safety as an American teenage girl living in Rabat, I recognized that the murder of the two young women did not embody who Moroccans are or what Morocco is. I continued to live normally in Rabat with some more vigilance. Three months later, I peered out of the bus window in awe of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and peaceful scenery surrounding me. I was in Imlil, the nearest town to the site of the murder. After meeting with our Moroccan host, the group, which included nine young Americans learning Arabic for nine months in Rabat, trekked through the village of Imlil on foot and mule passing small homes, curious children, and kind old men. I stayed in a bed and breakfast run by a Moroccan family. Our host helped us prepare tea overlooking the valley, and a woman who only spoke Tachelhit, a Tamazight (Berber) dialect, taught us how to make a special type of Amazigh (Berber) bread called “tannourt” traditionally.  From the balcony, I listened to the call to prayer rising from the mosques surrounding me and absorbed the breathtaking environment in front of me. Having stayed in Marrakech the night before, Imlil was a breath of fresh air, where we faced no harassment or catcalls and were respected by community members. In my seven months in Morocco, this was one of the most peaceful moments I have experienced. When the tagine dinner came to a close, it was finally time to discuss the topic that was on all of our minds: How had such a peaceful place become the scene of an act of terror? How had this attack impacted the community? What was the safety like now? Our host, a middle-aged Moroccan man, openly discussed the topic with us. He expressed how completely shocked the whole community was upon learning of the murder. They could not believe that such a thing had taken place in the village they called home. Half of the economy of Imlil is based on tourism, and for over 40 years, the town has catered and cared for tourists. Here we were, sitting in a candle-lit room only two kilometers away from where the attack happened. While I was deeply saddened by what had happened, I also recognized that the town of Imlil was not just the name in a headline of a news article or a place to be feared. Instead, it is a culturally rich community filled with caring individuals who have built their livelihoods around caring for foreigners who wish to come see or hike the beautiful mountains. Our host shared with us that he has experienced many booking cancellations since the attack and that fear has driven away tourism. However, with hope, he told us that the Moroccan government implemented new security measures and protocol to ensure that hikers are travelling with trusted guides and that the region is safe. My experience staying in Imlil reminded me that a region where an act of terror has occurred should not be consumed by that event. The hospitable, warm, and open people of Imlil and the striking scenery and nature surrounding them are the soul of Imlil. Imlil is not a headline or a place to fear, but instead a small village in the high Atlas Mountains known for its walnut and fruit production, an access point to Mount Toubkal, and a peaceful community. Just two kilometers away from where a tragic attack occurred, as a young foreign woman I felt safe with my trusted Moroccan hosts and grateful to witness the wonderful village of Imlil in person.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita has called the international community and “other parties” in the Western Sahara dossier to prioritize “frank dialogue” and “political feasibility” over ideology at the end of a two-day roundtable March 21-22. As perceived momentum continues to build around a prospective end to the political stalemate in the decades-long conflict, Bourita suggested “it is time now more than ever” to get past inflexible ideology-driven hostilities. Speaking at a news conference at the end of yesterday’s roundtable in Geneva, Nasser Bourita stressed Morocco’s “genuine interest” in paving the way for a common ground to settle the dispute. For Morocco, Bourita explained, ideological inflexibility and past grievances should not waste the newfound UN-inspired momentum. Instead, the focus should be on pushing for realistic and feasible compromises. According to Bourita, “Morocco is committed [to the UN-led process] with a constructive spirit as it seeks a definitive end to this regional conflict.” Morocco’s position, Bourita asserted, is consistent with the UN Security Council’s Resolution 2440, adopted in October 2018. He said the resolution historically urged Algeria and Mauritania, until then only referred to as “observer states,” to fully participate in the trust-building and the discussions for settling the Western Sahara dispute. Having agreed to search for a solution, all parties should show “real political will” and “go beyond the stale language and approaches of the past,” he stressed. Sounding optimistic, Bourita also expressed satisfaction with the momentum found under the auspices of Horst Kohler, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara. Bourita said that Morocco expects the UN process to capitalize on the December and March Geneva meetings and push for genuine diplomatic overtures in line with the UN Security Council’s recommendations. Bourita said that the UN and Morocco have closer visions on the steps needed to build trust and secure compromises than Polisario does. Expressions like “independence,” “referendum,” and “self-determination,” the gist of the Polisario Front’s demands, do not feature in the latest UN Security Council recommendations, Bourita explained. Instead, he pointed out, the document refers to a “mutually acceptable solution.” That expression appears on six occasions in the 2440 resolution, showing that the UN wants all parties to let go of their inflexible ideologies and rather focus on “what is realistic and politically feasible,” according to Bourita. In 2007, Morocco proposed what it called its “Autonomy Plan,” a document highlighting its vision for a lasting and sustainable political solution to the Sahara conflict. The plan calls for a legal framework that gives full political autonomy to Sahrawi locals under Moroccan sovereignty. With that Autonomy Plan, Bourita elaborated, Morocco showed its readiness for a “realist and pragmatic solution” based on compromises. Bourita concluded that Morocco’s plan is in “total adequacy with paragraph 2 of the UNSC 2440 resolution,” a paragraph that calls for a solution based on compromise, and Morocco is not ready to compromise any further than it already has. While Morocco applauds the momentum under the UN guidance, it wants the UN-led process to be a platform for brokering realistic deals rather than “an end in itself,” Bourita said.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent emergency aid to the survivors of the Tropical Cyclone Idai that hit Beira, a large port city in Mozambique, killing hundreds with thousands still missing. On the King’s instructions, the Royal Armed Forces will deliver 39 tons of aid, including tents, blankets, and foodstuffs, reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. The King’s move which follows an international call for aid by Mozambican authorities and reflects the strong “solidarity of the Kingdom of Morocco with the people of [Mozambique],” said the ministry. Cyclone Idai lashed Beira March 14-15 with winds of up to 170 kilometers per hour before moving inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing 557, according to the latest death tolls.  As many as 15,000 people have been reported missing in the wake of the cyclone. Beira, the largest city the cyclone hit, is home to 500,000 residents. The UN has called Cyclone Idai the most disastrous weather event ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. A week after the cyclone, cholera broke out in Mozambique. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned also of an increase in malaria. Morocco’s latest humanitarian aid to Palestine last year following a massacre against Palestinians by Israeli soldiers in May 2018 in the Gaza strip. FAR transported 1.8 tons of medical supplies and equipment for a Moroccan field hospital in Gaza, which arrived last October.

Rabat – The United Kingdom’s Foreign Office declared its rejection of US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. Israel later annexed the territory in 1981 and maintains control over it. “The UK views the Golan Heights as territory occupied by Israel. Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter,” read the statement.  It continued, “We did not recognise Israel’s annexation in 1981 and have no plans to change our position. Trump tweeted on March 21, “After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!” Violation of international law? Along with Russia, the French foreign ministry followed suit in dismissing Trump’s move as a breach of international law. “The recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, occupied territory, would be contrary to international law, in particular the obligation for states not to recognise an illegal situation,” declared the French foreign ministry.  In 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law to annex the area. Israel began establishing settlements on two-thirds of the area in the wake of the Six Day War, also known as Yom Kippur War. However, the United Nation Security Council’s Resolution 497 declared the Israeli move “null and void and without international legal effect.”  In a briefing on March 22, the deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, Farhan Haq, reiterated that the UN’s position is “reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council … Our policies have not changed on that regard.” Dennis Ross, a former director of policy planning in the US State Department, told Israeli news outlet Haaretz that Trump’s call was a “mistake” and would make a peace plan harder to achieve. “I don’t think it will contribute to [the administration’s] desire to present their peace plan. I think it will make it harder for Arab leaders to be responsive,” the outlet quoted Ross.  Following Trump’s statement, Israel’s minority Druze community is preparing marches in protest. According to Israeli news outlet 13News, Israel forces, right after Trump’s statement, began preparing for any possible “violent marches.”  Israel deployed snipers and riot forces along its borders with Syria to counter any potential demonstrations. In December 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He also moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of condolences to Iraqi President Barham Ahmed Salih following a tragedy that shook the country on Thursday—the sinking of a ferry that left almost 100 people dead, including children. In his message, the King expressed sympathy and compassion towards the grieving families of the victims and his deep “condolences to the Iraqi brothers,” praying that God grants mercy to the deceased and wishing patience for their relatives. Joy turned into tragedy on Thursday, March 21, when a ferry carrying families celebrating the Persian New Year, Nowruz, on the Tigris River near Mosul, Iraq, capsized. Many women and children drowned after struggling to swim against the river current. The ferry was carrying 200 people before it sank and killed almost 100. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi opened an investigation into the incident and promised to hold accountable anyone responsible for it.  Shocked and pained, a local civil servant told Reuters news agency that he was standing near the river when “suddenly the ferry started to tilt left and right, and passengers began screaming before it capsized.”

Rabat – As Christchurch’s Muslim community prepared yesterday to pay their final tributes to the victims of last week’s terrorist attacks, many New Zealanders, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, paid a heartfelt homage by wearing headscarves.   “New Zealand mourns with you. #WeAreOne“ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and thousands of others observe the Muslim Call to Prayer at Hagley Park near the Al Noor Mosque in #Christchurch #ChristchurchTerrorAttack pic.twitter.com/clbgkAneoU — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) March 22, 2019  Wearing a hijab at the funerals, Ardern gave a full-hearted speech about unity and solidarity in the face of collective tragedy. She said that the whole country stood with its Muslim community in mourning their dead. “We are one,” she noted. The hijab-wearing gesture quickly gained traction across the country and on social media, with thousands of non-Muslim New Zealanders wearing the Islamic symbol to express sympathy. Using the hashtag #HeadScarfforHarmony, they said they wanted to stand united with New Zealand’s Muslims and convey the message that the tragedy should sow seeds of solidarity rather than divisiveness. “I stand with our Muslim community today and against hate and violence,” one of the “headscarf for solidarity” sympathizers tweeted, accompanying the caption with a picture of herself with covered hair. Other users circulated the picture of a female police officer who wore a headscarf while attending to her duties at the funerals. A tweet from World HijabDay said, “A female officer wears hijab out of respect during funerals…” A female officer wears #hijab out of respect during funerals for two people killed in the #Christchurch mosque attacks.#HeadScarfforHarmony pic.twitter.com/lqjtVc2Ve5 — World HijabDay (@WorldHijabDay) March 21, 2019  Rafaela Stoakes told AFP that it was her way of joining in with mourning and standing with her Muslim friends. She said, “I felt a form of pride in paying tribute to my Muslim friends.” She noted, however, that she “also felt a bit vulnerable” being the only one to wear the hijab in her surroundings. “It takes some courage to wear one every day.”

Rabat – LafargeHolcim Maroc, the Moroccan subsidiary of a global cement company, has appointed Ali Fassi Fihri to chair its board. Fassi Fihri is replacing former chair Tarafa Marouane, who resigned. The company made the announcement in a press release issued after the March 19 LafargeHolcim board meeting.  Established in 2015 by the merger of cement companies Lafarge and Holcim, LafargeHolcim describes itself as the leading global building materials company serving masons, builders, architects, and engineers. The company also holds offices in 80 countries and employs 90,000 employees. LafargeHolcim Maroc posted a significant drop, 18 percent, in its International Financial Reporting Standards consolidated net income from 2017 to 2018. The company’s income was MAD 1.584 billion in 2018 compared to MAD 1.927 billion in 2017. Fassi Fihri managed the National Office for Drinking Water and Electricity (ONEE) for 15 years from October 2002 to October 2017, when King Mohammed VI dismissed him from his post. The royal decision, part of what became known as the “political earthquake,” came after the King expressed discontent with the slow pace of development projects in northern Morocco’s Al Hoceima area. The King had inaugurated the “Al Hoceima, Manarat Al Moutawassit” initiative to develop the region in October 2015, but the projects met irregular delays. An investigation by the Court of Auditors into the developmental delays in Al Hoceima revealed serious imbalances. When King Mohammed VI received the report, he made a series of dismissals. Along with Fassi Fihri, the King dismissed four ministers from Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s cabinet, a right the King retains under Article 47 of the Constitution. The King fired education minister Mohamed Hassad, health minister El Houcine Louardi, housing minister Nabil Benabdellah, and Secretary of State for Vocational Training Larbi Bencheikh.

Rabat – Italian police in Settimo Torinese, northern Italy, have searched the house of Italian national Salvatore Caruso, 86, for the body of his Moroccan wife, Samira Sbiaa, who disappeared 17 years ago. Caruso, who never reported Sbiaa as missing, is now under investigation for murder, reported Italian news agency ANSA on Thursday, March 21.  According to Italian authorities, an initial search found several weapons and revealed signs of human remains in the husband’s house. Police have used sniffer dogs and will conduct scientific tests which will require some time given the house’s dilapidation, said Giuseppe Ferrando, a prosecutor in Ivrea, a city nearby. Nobody has heard from Sbiaa—who would be 49 now—since April of 2002. Sbiaa’s family members in Morocco had repeatedly tried to reach out to Italian authorities to look into her disappearance but their reports never reached the police, said Italian news outlet La Republica. Last month, a women’s association called Asti, led by Moroccan Touria Bouksibi, reported Sbiaa’s disappearance to the Italian authorities.  Sbiaa and Caruso met in Morocco through a relative and got married soon after. After her marriage, Sbiaa rarely visited her family back in Morocco, according to Italian outlet La Repubblica.

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Council has passed a bill approving a framework agreement on economic cooperation with the Czech Republic, said the government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, on March 21 in Rabat. The trade ministers of Morocco and the Czech Republic signed the framework agreement in December at the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. The government’s decision to approve the bill follows years of bilateral efforts to advance economic cooperation between the two countries. According to the Czech Trade Promotion Agency (CzechTrade), exports from the Czech Republic to Morocco increased by 108 percent between 2010 and 2014. Growth in trade provided momentum for further economic cooperation, culminating in a series of high-level meetings. In December, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani received Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis while he was in Rabat on a two-day business visit with several ministers and 37 business leaders. Later in December, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said, “Morocco could become the Czech Republic’s largest economic partner” in Africa at the launch of the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. At the Casablanca forum, the head of CzechTrade in Morocco, Tamer El-Sibai, said the energy, agricultural, and building sectors are especially promising. Morocco will invest $30 billion in the energy sector alone, he added.  However, Babis, at his visit, said, “Unfortunately, I have to say that Czech companies … lack interest, especially in investments in the energy sector,” according to Radio Praha. The automobile sector is another area of potential for Czech export to Morocco, Babis pointed out. “Morocco is Africa’s largest car manufacturer. We import Renault and Dacia cars from Morocco.” Babis continued, “The Czech Republic exports 2,400 Skoda cars a year to Morocco. There is an ambition to reach 4000 soon.”  Beyond trade, the Czech Republic supports Morocco in preventing the transit of sub-Saharan immigrants to Europe. Earlier in March, Hungary announced Morocco would receive a €30 million aid package approved at a summit between Eastern Europe’s Visegrad Group, which includes the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February.

Rabat – Contractual teachers are continuing to strike across a number of Moroccan cities in protest of what they see as the government’s inability to work out viable solutions to the current dilemma of education. The government is now threatening to fire the teachers if they do not return to work. After weeks of protests and sit-ins, contractual teachers are denouncing the government for not meeting their demands, following statements from Minister of Education Said Amzazi and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi that the government would not abandon employment by contract. The National Coalition for the Defense of Public Education called on political parties and activists to join a march on Sunday, March 24, to the Ministry of Education in Rabat. The coalition announced in a statement that the march would denounce “the state’s fierce attack on public schools in an attempt to undermine public services and what is left of free education and give up its social responsibilities.” Is the government ready to make concessions? The government showed an indecisive attitude regarding the state of contractual teachers. On March 9, Amzazi announced that the Ministry of Education would abolish employment under fixed-term contract, giving contractual teachers similar benefits as those permanent teachers have. After teachers refused the offer, El Khalfi said in a statement that the protests are “unjustifiable and seek to achieve political objectives.” He argued the protests “have nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.” El Khalfi stressed that the government’s employment plan was strategic and that the framework Law 51-17 is irrevocable. The law implemented the government’s “2015-2030 strategic vision” to reform education. Protesting teachers are complaining about articles 45 and 48 of the law, which impose school fees at secondary schools and universities. According to protesters, the articles seek to “undermine free public education” and are a “blow to the poor families.” Despite the ministry’s first “concession” to give contractual teachers more benefits, the decision did not mean that the government would hire contractual teachers within the ministry but within regional academies instead. Teachers saw this as a “patchy solution” and refused it altogether.  They said that as employees of regional academies, they would still be subject to the framework law of the private sector. At the heart of their demands is that they want to enjoy the benefits of working in the public sector. Consensual agreement or coercion? The education ministry issued what seems its last ultimatum, warning teachers to resume classes within a one-week period and threatened to fire them if they do not return to work. Amzazi stated the government will not give up on the contract system and requested that teachers resume classes or run the risk of being made redundant. As both teachers and government refuse to give in, teachers are considering extending their protests to one week and pushing for a “blank year” (annee blanche) of striking from work in defiance of the government’s warnings. One teacher told Morocco World News, “We cannot make concessions on our rights. We have to fight for them.” He added, “It’s our constitutional right to stage strike as long as the government refuses to open a dialogue with us and solve this issue together.” What future for the education system?  Now that the government has taken a step backward and refused to make any “further concessions,” teachers are relentless in their demand for the government to relinquish contractual employment in education. Early this week, police forces met protesting teachers in Morocco’s southern city of Dakhla with batons and used “excessive force” to bush them back, according to a Moroccan media outlet, injuring many and leaving some in critical conditions. The government hired the contractual teachers to meet a shortage of teachers in public schools left by 70,000 teachers who retired.

Rabat – The Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Kohler has expressed plans to convene a third roundtable for the four parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict. In a press conference after the end of the second roundtable on Friday, Kohler commended all the delegations for their commitment and engagement in coming to the second meeting at his request. Sharing personal remarks, Kohler said that the first roundtable, held in December in Geneva, was seen as a “small, but an encouraging step in the search of a solution to the Western Sahara conflict.” The envoy said that no one should be surprised when he says that finding a solution to the conflict will not be easy. “There is still a lot of work ahead of the delegations. Nobody should expect a quick outcome,” said Kohler. Kohler acknowledged that it is important that for the delegations to be “able to listen to each other, even [when] things get controversial.” He added that it is necessary for the parties to build trust to make progress. According to Kohler, the roundtable “demonstrated that all delegations are aware that many people, in particular those whose lives are directly affected by this conflict, are placing their hope in this process.” He noted that “the costs of this conflict in terms of human suffering, lack of prospects for youth, and security risks” are high. “Western Sahara people need and deserve this conflict to end,” Kohler said, calling on the parties to engage seriously in the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. After sharing his thoughts, the personal envoy read the joint press release of the delegations. The delegations said that they were committed to respecting and engaging in the process. “They agreed to continue discussions in order to identify elements of convergence,” Kholer  said, adding that there was “a consensus that a solution to the Sahara issue will benefit the whole Maghreb.” The delegations also “commended the Personal Envoy’s intention to invite them back again to a meeting according to the same format,” reads the joint press release. Like at the first roundtable, Kohler seemed positive about the talks. The second round table, which took place on March 221-22, comes on the heels of the first meeting in December 2018.The second roundtable’s purpose, according to the UN, was for the parties involved in the conflicts to “start approaching elements needed for building an enduring solution based on compromise.” Thus far, each party sticks to its position, with Morocco reiterating that the autonomy plan is the only option on the table, and the Polisario still calling on the UN to hold a referendum on self-determination. Meanwhile, Algeria has not budged in its attempts to deny any major involvement in the conflict.  Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who is leading the Moroccan delegation, said in January that the autonomy plan aims to integrate Sahrawis into development plans and to preserve the Moroccan Sahrawi heritage.

Rabat – Morocco’s Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) announced that its annual net profits in 2018 “attributable to shareholders” rose to MAD 2.9 billion, Reuters reported. The figure is a 3.5 percent increase from 2017. In a statement on March 19, BCP published its results for 2018 and asserted that its activities in Morocco and African branches recorded “significant” improvement. BCP took on 260,000 new customers in 2018. BCP already had 6 million customers across Morocco, Europe, and the Gulf, the press agency noted. The bank made loans of MAD 15 billion in 2018 and increased its market share to more than 24 percent of the Moroccan banking sector. “Net banking income grew 4 percent to 17 billion dirhams on the back of an improvement in the commercial segment while general risk provisions rose to 4.1 billion dirhams,” Reuters reported. BCP’s African branches also increased both their loans and deposits.  BCP increased its loans to Moroccan companies by 9.4 over 2017. “This evolution is mainly driven by commercial performance as well as the good progress of intermediation activities, in Morocco and abroad,” said the BCP group in a statement. In October 2018, the Moroccan bank announced its intention to acquire banks in Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, and Tanzania with a goal to derive 30 percent of its revenues from the rest of Africa by 2020. BCP received only 18 percent of its revenue from its African branches in 2017. BCP also holds overseas offices in Spain, England, Germany, France, Gibraltar, the Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium.

Rabat – On a hot and sunny afternoon at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre, Malawi, Morocco’s Atlas Lions and Malawi’s Flames neutralized each other, ending 0-0, after what looked more like 90 minutes of pointless and dispirited sprinting after the ball. The game was Morocco’s last qualifier for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). For Morocco’s coach Herve Renard and his bunch of youthful lads, today’s game was more an experimentation than a show of character, having already won the most defining games. Facing Malawi, a team Morocco had emphatically defeated in September 2018, it was sensible to expect a slew of changes in the squad. Renard decided to rest the majority of the team’s starters, giving them time to freshen up before a much sterner challenge against Argentina next week. And yet, as ever, a Renard-coached Morocco, however bereft of the creativity of players like Belhanda and Hakim Ziyech, still succeeded in showing control and confidence. Renard’s philosophy, as he hammered in interviews and press conferences before and after today’s match, is that every game matters when you dream of the highest accolades. Playing Malawi, a squad already disqualified from CAN, mattered insofar as it was a time to know where the team stands in the months before the continental scramble for CAN 2019, Renard offered before the game. He maintained the same line of reasoning after the draw. The way Morocco dominated the game and the composure of this afternoon’s mostly young and second-choice squad, he said, was evidence that he can count on his bench when needed. Renard exaggerated quite a bit. But based on the performance of the Atlas Lions in Malawi, it was easy to get what he meant. Morocco’s Lions were utterly dominant, and for much of the game it seemed Malawi were the already qualified squad and Morocco were the ones playing for some last-minute exploit to salvage their honor. Malawi should have seen it coming. In fact they did it see it, and they did prepare accordingly, playing the first minutes of the match like a united legion playing to keep shame at bay. Perhaps being already disqualified seemed less bitter and far less humiliating than a final emphatic defeat on home soil. But that Malawi saw it does not mean that they stopped it. Try as the southeastern African side did against a youthful and promising Moroccan team, they were unable to keep Morocco from making Malawi’s middle and flanks irrelevant for the entire game. Even without its usual midfield maestros, it was Morocco that set the rules in the center. In their demeanor and sense of control, there was a striking sense they played thinking not of the present—which already seemed under their control—but rather of the future. This, Renard’s post-match comments suggested, looks like a squad that has every reason to fancy themselves the next African champions. But for all the dominance, Morocco was wasteful, misdirecting final passes and finding difficulty getting around Malawi’s compact-looking defensive wall. For 20 minutes, the game ran like an exercise in purposelessness. Morocco attacked relentlessly, as though they still needed a victory here to make a statement. But the attacks lacked quality and depth, with the only adrenaline-eliciting moments coming towards the end of the first half, when Charles Swini, Malawi’s goalkeeper, deftly intervened to prevent a dangerous-looking cross from causing any more danger. The second half, though a bit more exciting, was an extension of the purposeless sprints and crosses that characterized the first half. It would be untrue to call the game sleepy, but calling it exciting would also be quite insulting. Malawi, playing at home for pride but fearing that a more adventurous play would have left them more wounded in their pride than they had been prior to the game, mostly parked the bus and played with the intermittent bursts of a side feigning inspiration. It was clear, as early as the 75th minute, who the victors would be: No one. Missing its creative geniuses, Morocco’s growing technical machine needed some more oil to score one goal out of the many opportunities it got this afternoon. Lacking fluidity in the most crucial instances, Morocco’s Lions raised their paws more than they roared, causing no panic in Malawi’s defense. But Malawi also deserves some credit. Sensing that the Morocco that thumped them 3-0 in their first match last year was different than the strong but amputee squad they were now up against, the Flames realized that they could cause some damage if they took it upon themselves to try some adventure, go forward, and actually play football. The game then picked up in excitement and last-minute dramas, but the clock already showed 80 minutes, and there was a sense that this would be it for the afternoon. In those promising last 10 minutes, Rachid Alioui’s sensational free kick failed. It was the third time that Morocco, through the same Alioui, hit Malawi’s woodwork. “We tried and gave our best,” Morocco’s French coach said afterwards. That was it: They tried to win but could not, with their best chances hitting up against a Malawian side that was visibly hell-bent on conceding no goal, even if that meant scoring none either.

Rabat – Police in Birmingham, England, are investigating apparent hate attacks on five mosques, including one whose windows were smashed with a sledgehammer late on Thursday night. Officers had received alerts about the violence minutes between each attack. Police officers and counterterrorism officials in charge of the investigation said a man used a sledgehammer to vandalize one of the mosques. “The motive behind the attacks, which are being treated as linked, is yet to be established, but West Midlands Police and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit are investigating,” police stated. The Muslim community in the region fears for its safety in the worship places. Yousef Zaman, the chairman of Masjid Faizul Islam mosque, one of the targeted mosques, told reporters: “There’s a fear factor now in that adults are saying they’re going to keep their children away from the mosque today because they’re worried that it’s not safe.” Expressing shock and disgust at the attacks, he resolved to continue attending the mosque: “We’re not going to stop worship, we’re going to carry on as normal, we won’t let them win, we will defy them.” Birmingham is home to a large Muslim community. In the UK 2011 Census, 21.8 percent of the Birmingham population declared they were Muslim. Last Friday, March 15, 50 Muslims were killed in terror attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attacks shook the world but also united New Zealanders, who showed support and compassion toward the families of the victims. Today, March 22, one week since the terror attack, thousands of New Zealanders rallied near Al Noor Mosque in mourning. Women, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, wore the hijab to show support for the Muslim community. The country also broadcast the Friday call to prayer on national television and observed two minutes of silence. Mosques have been the target of many hate and Islamophobic attacks across the world. Earlier in March, the German Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) group attacked a mosque in the Netherlands by hanging a banner with an obscene message insulting the prophet next to a mannequin dressed in traditional Arab male dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint. The Islamophobic attacks on Muslims and sacred places continue to spark condemnations.

Rabat – The head coach of the Nigerian football team, Gernot Rohr, has said that Egypt and Morocco are his favorites to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Quoted by several international news outlets, Rohr said, “According to the last FIFA ranking, Morocco are currently the best in Africa, while Egypt will play at home and enjoy the support of their fans, and for this reason both teams are the closest to the title.” Rohr said that his team will do its utmost in the big tournament. “I am very positive. We will go to the tournament to perform well and compete for the title.” Rohr has a more optimistic view of Morocco’s football team than their head coach, Herve Renard. In January, Renard said that the Egypt and Senegal teams are his favorites to win the AFCON title. He said that the Atlas Lions will go with “ambitions, which is normal. But today, there are two great favorites: Egypt of course, and Senegal. Morocco, with Algeria, Tunisia, Cote d’Ivoire and others, is among the outsiders.” The tournament will begin on June 21 in Egypt. On Friday, March 22, Morocco’s national team will play its last qualifier game of the competition against Malawi in Blantyre, Malawi. The qualification stage for the tournament ends Tuesday, March 26, but Morocco has already qualified.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun, and the EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, Pierre Moscovici, discussed Morocco’s efforts to promote good tax governance on Thursday, March 21, in Brussels. Benchaaboun said in a statement that, in addition to taxation, they discussed other topics of common interest.  Benchaaboun added that the EU Council has taken note of “a positive evolution in Morocco’s commitment to respect the rules of good governance as they are generally practiced for all developed countries.” He asserted that Morocco will adopt a framework law this year on the “principles of taxation and good tax governance.” Moscovici welcomed Morocco’s fiscal efforts. “Morocco has done the right thing by modifying tax regimes that could be harmful [to] good tax governance,” he said. In 2018, the EU added Morocco to its tax haven “grey list” of countries given time to reform their fiscal policies. In March 2019, the union did not move Morocco to its “black list” of tax havens, but gave it until the end of 2019 to enact reforms, citing the progress Morocco achieved in 2018. As with other countries on the grey list, Morocco has one to two years to reform tax policies. After his meeting with Benchaaboun, Moscovici wrote a tweet praising “the fruitful cooperation with Morocco on good tax governance. Confident that the commitments made will be maintained!” The meeting also highlighted the prospects for economic cooperation between the EU and Morocco. “We have planned missions in the coming weeks to establish the principles of a much closer collaboration than in the past,” said Benchaaboun. Moscovici said he will soon be going to Rabat “to strengthen our economic cooperation.” He welcomed the “positive results,” citing in particular the EU-Morocco fisheries and agricultural agreements that will come into force “very soon.” In January, the EU Parliament passed the Moscovici-proposed amendment to the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement that includes Western Sahara. Pro-Polisario groups opposed the deal, saying that Morocco “exploits the natural resources” of Western Sahara. However, a group of Sahrawis urged the EU to adopt the agreement, citing benefits for the development of the region. In 2018, according to the EU Commission, Morocco’s trade with the EU was €39 billion. Morocco maintained a 1.2 percent share of EU international trade. The EU imports from Morocco were worth €16 billion and exports €23 billion.

Rabat – The national market has prepared foods in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of citizens during Ramadan, said Lahcen Daoudi on Thursday, March 21. During a meeting of the interministerial commission in charge of food and price monitoring, Daoudi, the minister delegate for general affairs and governance stressed that everything needed in Ramadan is “available in the domestic market, in higher levels than last year.” Daoudi noted the drop in food prices in contrast with last year, “particularly those of chickpeas.” He assured consumers that the prices would not change during Ramadan, which will begin May 5 or 6. During Ramadan, chickpeas are especially important as a base for Moroccan soups. Other popular food items during the holy month in Morocco include meat, fruits, fish, dairy products, and breads. Daoudi chaired a government meeting Thursday that also reviewed wheat production and the need to have a sufficient supply for consumer demand during Ramadan. Last year, a major boycott campaign in April against the high prices of commodities continued through Ramadan, which began  May 16. At the time, the Moroccan government evaluated the supplies of fruits and vegetables, while also strictly monitoring their prices to prevent price manipulation in accordance with Law 31-08 on consumer protection. According to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP), which keeps track of economic, demographic, and social statistics, food prices in the country dropped by 0.4 percent from December 2018 to January 2019.  Fruit prices fell by 3 percent, vegetables by 2.8 percent, meat by 1 percent, and dairy products by 0.2 percent.

Rabat – The people of New Zealand came together on Friday to mourn the 50 lives lost in the terror attacks on two Christchurch mosques, one week ago. It is a national day of mourning in which the country broadcast the Muslim call to prayer on television and observed two minutes of silence in memory of the victims. Before Friday prayers, an estimated 20,000 people attended a memorial service in Hagley Park near Al Noor mosque where most of the worshippers who died lost their lives in the first attack on Friday, March 15.  At 1:30 p.m. local time, the national television and radio broadcast the call to prayer, followed by two minutes of silence. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed the thousands of people gathered at Hagley Park.  She expressed: “This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart … Instead, we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable … we are brokenhearted, but we are not broken. We are alive, we are together, we are determined to not let anyone divide us.” Ardern spoke directly to the families of the victims, saying, “Your loved ones did not die in vain. Their blood has watered the seeds of hope.”  “New Zealand mourns with you. We are one.” Imam Gamal Fouda, who survived the terror attack at Al Noor Mosque, told mourners in Christchurch during his sermon that he “saw hatred and rage in the eyes of the terrorist.” In the eyes of thousands of New Zealanders and “human beings from around the globe,” however, he saw “ love and compassion.”  The imam called on governments across the globe to fight hate speech and anti-Islamic rhetoric. “It was the result of the anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim rhetoric by some political leaders, some media agencies, and others,” he stated. At the front row of the gathering, wounded survivors sat in wheelchairs in front of non-Muslim New Zealanders standing in the rear rows. Women, including Ardern, wore the hijab to show their respect and support for the Muslim community.

Rabat – The UK has updated its foreign travel advisory for Morocco, advising its citizens to be “vigilant at all times.” The UK said that “terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco,” recalling the Imlil murders when terrorists decapitated two Scandinavian tourists  near Mount Toubkal. Britain also warned that “attacks could be indiscriminate or target foreigners.” The warning mentioned the April 2011 terror attack when “17 people were killed and 25 injured in a  large explosion caused by a bomb in Marrakech at the Argana restaurant in Djema el-Fna Square.” “There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time,” said the warning. Last month, in a controversial move, the UK revoked the citizenship of a teenaged girl, Shamima Begum, who had joined ISIS in Syria in 2015 but wanted to return to the UK after giving birth. Begum’s three-week-old son died earlier this month in Syria, the third of her children to die in infancy, according to the Guardian. Canada also updated its travel advisory for Morocco on December 20, days after authorities found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway on December 17. Morocco has experienced comparatively fex terror attacks. The Argana cafe bomb was the last terror attack in Morocco before the Imlil murders.  Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy, which was modernized and updated in 2015 with the creation of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), an elite anti-terrorism police bureau, has helped curb terrorist threats in the country.  Following the Imlil murders, senior Moroccan officials said that every country faces the threat of terrorism. Morocco’s security services arrested at least 22 suspects in connection to the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists.

Rabat – France has awarded three Moroccan personalities the order of knight of the Legion of Honor of the French Republic on Wednesday in Rabat. The recipients are Chief of Protocol to Morocco’s Head of Government Omar Ait Salah; radiologist and social anthropologist Chakib Guessous; and the director of the Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNuR), Khammar Mrabit.  Jean-Francois Girault, the ambassador of France to Morocco, awarded the honors on behalf of the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, at a ceremony attended by prominent political, business, diplomatic, and arts personalities. Girault praised Omar Ait Salah’s contribution to the organization of high-level meetings between Morocco and France, which have been “key spaces for the expression of the rich and diverse exceptional partnership between our two countries.”  He also spoke of Chakib Guessous’s “unfailing commitment” to children’s rights and his concern to move society towards “greater cohesion.” Guessous is a doctor of anthropology and political sociology, radiologist, actor, and author. He focuses on children’s rights, schooling, literacy, poverty, and marginalization.  Guessous wrote “The Exploitation of Innocence” on Moroccan child labor in 2005 and “Marriage and Concubinage in the Arab Countries” in 2018. Girault also remarked on Khammar Mrabit’s commitment to nuclear safety, both within the International Atomic Energy Agency and as the director general of the AMSSNuR. The honorees welcomed the recognition and invoked the common history of Morocco and France. The Legion of Honor, founded in 1802, is France’s highest order of merit. It has approximately 92,000 members, rewarded for their outstanding merits in the service of causes that France defends. The knight of the Legion of Honor is awarded for a minimum of 20 years of public service or 25 years of professional activity and merits. Historically, three Moroccans received the Legion of Honor’s grand cross degree: Muhammad IV, the 19th century sultan of Morocco; T’hami El Glaoui, a pro-French protectorate-era pasha of Marrakech, and Mahamed Tazi, a pasha of Fez.

Rabat – A Moroccan boy named Samir became a hero on Wednesday, March 20, when a school bus driver abducted Samir along with 50 others on a bus in Milan. The 47-year-old Senegalese-Italian school bus driver, Ousseynou Sy, hijacked the bus and set it ablaze in a protest over Italy’s migration policy. The driver was asking children to hand over their phones. After collecting everyone’s phone, he stood in front of Samir shouting and screaming for his phone. The 12-year-old did not get scared but kept his phone in his pocket to call his parents later, reported Italian outlet Lastampa. “Give it to me!” the driver shouted. “Today I didn’t bring it,” Samir replied. Samir, who was sitting on the back row of the bus, managed to quietly call his parents to inform them about the abduction.  The parents quickly called the police who arrived at the scene, causing Sy to exit the bus and quickly set it alight. Police managed to break through the bus’s windows and rescue all the children in time. However, many Italian news outlets reported that the hero is an Egyptian named Ramy Shehata. None of the children received serious injuries, although 14 people experienced smoke inhalation, according to the BBC.

Rabat – After demands to declare Amazigh New Year, known as Yennayer in Morocco, a public holiday, Amazigh (Berber) activists are now calling on Google to integrate Tamazight (Berber) into Google Translate. The French-based La Rando organization, managed by its Moroccan founder Karim Akachar, launched a petition to Google on Avaaz. On March 20, La Rando announced the Google Translate team responded, saying the petition was “taken into account.” The petition has secured more than 36,579 signatures and aims for 50,000. The petition reads: “North Africa is the bearer of a language and culture that have crossed centuries and enriched human civilization significantly.” Akachar added that over 60 million people speak Tamazight in North Africa, the Sahara-Sahel region, and across the world in countries like France and Canada. Google Translate currently serves more than 100 languages. “The Tamazight community has been calling for this possibility. Thus, we, associations, organizations, North African citizens, Tamazight people of the whole world and learners of Tamazight language, signatories of this appeal, ask GOOGLE to integrate Tamazight in Google Translate.” The petition also recalled that Facebook had issued a statement before, promising to include Tamazight on its website. In a conversation with Morocco World News, Moroccan Amazigh activist Mounir Keiji welcomed the initiative. He said that the petition is of “huge importance.” Keiji hoped Google would add Tamazight to its machine translation service to show people that the language is not minor as some believe. “Tamazight is an evolving language despite constraints and globalization. It is certain that this news will help in the spread, learning, translation, and writing of this language,” Keiji said. The activist also welcomed the spread of Tamazight and the Amazigh culture on social media. “This will help a lot to ensure creativity in this language, which has suffered greatly in history,” Keiji added. Throughout last year, Amazigh activists call on the Moroccan government to make Amazigh New Year, also known as Yennayer, a national holiday every January 12. January 12, 2019, marked the 2,969 Amazigh year.  The Moroccan Constitution, amended in 2011, lists Tamazight as an official language together with Arabic.  In 2018, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that 4,200 primary schools in Morocco teach Tamazight, while more than 500,000 students study the language. In November, the Ministry of Education said that the number of primary school children studying Tamazight language this academic year has increased to 600,000.

Rabat – Italy deported a Moroccan imam on a direct flight to Casablanca on Monday, March 18, on the grounds of radicalism. The Italian la Voce outlet reported that the imam was propagating extremist interpretations of Qur’anic precepts during his sermons. The Italian Ministry of the Interior deported Houssam Din Rouzak, 36, “for security reasons,” the Italian Corriere Torino news outlet reported.  Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini described Din Rouzak in a tweet as “radicalized” and “violent.” There is “zero tolerance for those who, in the name of God, attempt to wage war in our homeland,” he wrote.  Italian intelligence services have kept a close watch on Din Rouzak since 2012, when he adopted a rigid understanding of the Qur’an and showed an “aggressive attitude” towards colleagues at the Center of Islamic Studies in Novara. A permanent resident in Italy, Din Rouzak recently became an imam at a mosque in Vercelli, a city near Milan. His behavior became more pronounced after he became imam at the Islamic Cultural Association of Vercelli in 2017. The Vercelli community relieved Din Rouzak of his duties last summer after he picked violent quarrels with other Muslims, according to la Voce. Since his appointment at the Vercelli mosque in 2017, Din Rouzak was “extremely radical and critical of his Muslim compatriots for keeping company with Italians,” reported Italian newspaper II Messagero. According to Salvini, Italy has expelled approximately 384 people considered dangerous to the country’s security since 2015: 21 people in 2019, 126 in 2018, 105 in 2017, and 66 in 2016, and 66 in 2015.

Rabat – The Deputy Spokesman of the UN Secretary-General Farhan Haq read out a brief statement to the press on Thursday, March 21, about the UN’s second roundtable on Western Sahara without giving specific details on the closed-door discussions. Haq said that all the delegations participated in the meeting on Western Sahara hosted by the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Horst Kohler. The UN official added that during the March 21-22 meeting, which is convening Morocco, Mauritania, Polisario, and Algeria, the delegations are expected to “discuss elements of a solution in accordance with Security Council resolution 2440 (2018), to revisit regional issues and to explore trust-building measures.” Kohler is also hoping for the meeting to be built on the “positive dynamic achieved during the first round table, held last December in Geneva.” The statement concluded that Kohler and the delegations of Morocco and the Polisario Front will speak to the press at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on Friday afternoon. Kohler’s statement will be webcast, Haq added. None of the parties involved in the conflict provide official statements on the first working session of the meeting, which kicked off Thursday in Le Rosey Chateau near Geneva. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita is leading a delegation of four members: Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale; the president of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid; the president of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, Ynja Khattat; and a member of the Smara municipal council, Fatima Adli. The Moroccan delegation strategically includes elected representatives from Morocco’s southern provinces, highlighting their status as spokespeople for the Sahrawi population.

Rabat – Morocco and Finnish mold manufacturer SabriScan have entered into an automotive industry ecosystem agreement, announced SabriScan CEO Jari Kokkonen on Tuesday, March 19. SabriScan, a Finnish company founded in 1998, manufactures mold internationally for Tier One car suppliers such as Valeo, Hella, and Schieffer. It is the first mold supplier to have an agreement in Morocco. According to the company, SabriScan’s business model is based on “more efficient machining techniques, global delivery of molds, local service partnerships, high quality, and global manufacturing capacity.” In January, SabriScan opened a subsidiary in the automotive industry center in Tangier and has plans to expand further in the wake of the new agreement. “We are very proud that [the Moroccan] Ministry has chosen us as a partner,” said CEO Jari Kokkonen. Abdelouahed Rahal, the director of the automobile industry at the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy, said, “To have as a partner a high-tech mold supplier such as SabriScan is definitely a must to enable Morocco to become more competitive in the automobile sector.” Both sides see the deal as mutually beneficial as SabriScan can better serve global clients from Morocco, while Morocco hopes the new agreement will attract more global companies to the country. Additionally, the industry ministry is working with SabriScan to develop a training program for high-tech mold manufacturing. SabriScan would build a full-scale mold manufacturing unit with maintenance services and technical support and help with the training of young Moroccans. Morocco has made significant efforts to step up its automotive industry in the past few years. In October 2018, the Wall Street Journal acknowledged Morocco as the automotive leader in Africa. Surpassing South Africa in passenger vehicle production in 2017, Morocco is a key supplier for European auto factories and is expected to outpace Italy in production in the near future. Even with this success, Morocco is intent on further growth, seeking a significant foothold in the global industry. The government is determined to have the industry exceed MAD 200 billion in exports with a production capacity of 1 million vehicles by 2025. Morocco has worked towards the accomplishment of this goal in two ways: Implementing corporate tax exemptions to attract foreign investment and making efforts to increase local integration in the sector to 60 percent by 2020. Morocco uses investment incentives such as the tax exemptions to attract foreign investment. Currently, the incentives include a five-year corporate tax exemption and a 25-year exemption if the majority of the products are exported. Additionally, the government offers VAT exemptions, land subsidies, and rebates of up to 30 percent on investment costs. Morocco has attracted numerous global partners including Alten, Nexteer, Ficosa, Gestamp, Renault, and Peugeot. Nexteer, an American automotive company, announced in February 2018 plans to open a production plant in Kenitra. Nexteer employs more than 10,000 people globally and produces parts for car companies such as BMW, Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen. The facility, expected to open sometime this year, will be the first of its kind in Africa. In October 2018 the French engineering and technology consulting group Alten opened an automotive center of excellence in Rabat. The center works to train Moroccan engineers and develop the ecosystem of Engineering Services Outsourcing (ESO). The creation of the center is expected to create upwards of 500 jobs in the automotive sector. In recent years, Morocco has struggled to overcome high unemployment rates and strengthen its economy. According to a report by Morocco’s Economic, Social, Environmental Council (CESE), the economy is not growing fast enough to match either population growth or an increase in university graduates. CESE reported that many young people graduate with skills unsuitable for industry needs. Programs such as the one established jointly by Morocco and Alten which provide young Moroccans with specific technical training seek to increase employment. All of the foreign manufacturing investment agreements coupled with the rapid growth of Morocco’s automotive sector aim to stimulate the Moroccan economy and provide more industry jobs. Andrew Baid, global CEO of Education for Employment, said in October that Morocco’s expansion of the automotive industry has been “a very concentrated, deliberate effort that needs to be replicated across other industries.”

Rabat – When a terrorist attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50, one week ago, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately sprang into action. Jacinda Ardern, one of New Zealand’s youngest ever prime ministers at just 38 years old, is receiving praise globally for her calm and compassionate attitude following the tragedy on Friday, March 15. Just hours after the attack, Ardern called a press conference with the clear aim of informing the public as much as possible and dubbing the incident an act of terrorism.  She also called for unity after a tragedy that could cause division, pointing out that “many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand.” “They may even be refugees,” she said.  But seeking to dispel an “us versus them” mentality, she reminded the nation, “They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us.” The next day, on Saturday, March 16, Ardern flew to Christchurch to lay flowers at Kilbirnie Mosque and offer her condolences to the city’s Muslim community in person. She wore a black hijab as a sign of respect with an expression of grief and empathy. Photographs show her embracing and walking hand in hand with the mourning relatives of the victims.  One picture in particular of the prime minister that day has gone viral, showing Ardern through a window in her black hijab with a pained expression on her face. Kirk Hargreaves, Christchurch’s city council photographer, took the photo. “The moment I saw her face pop up, and what was happening with the flowers, I fully knew [it was important]. It’s a religious photo in a way, a photo of a mix of religious symbolism. It looks like stain glass, there’s the Muslim hijab, and colours of Hindu religion. It’s a universal picture,” Hargreaves told the Sydney Morning Herald. While in Christchurch, Ardern also addressed concerns that the victims’ bodies would not be returned in time for burial within 24 hours of death, a Muslim tradition, and reassured families that the deceased would be returned to their loved ones as quickly as possible. She also told the community that the state would be offering NZ $10,000 grants to cover the funeral cost of victims.  The families are also eligible for “one-off payments, and ongoing assistance provisions for things like childcare and of course compensation for the loss of income.” Ardern also immediately pledged to make long-term government changes to prevent tragedies like the Christchurch terror attack from happening again. On Saturday, March 16, she announced her intentions to strengthen New Zealand’s gun laws.  During a press conference following her visit to Christchurch, Ardern said, “I can tell you one thing right now. Our gun laws will change.”  She referenced Australia’s crackdown on firearms in 1996, just 12 days after a mass shooting killed 35 people in Tasmania. “I reflect, again, Australia, when they experienced a tragedy, a mass shooting in the 1990s, it took them 12 days. We will do it in less but only through extraordinary effort,” she said. And she stuck true to her word. On March 21, just six days after the Christchurch terror attack, Ardern announced “that New Zealand will ban all military-style semi-automatic weapons. We will also ban all assault rifles. We will ban all high capacity magazines. We will ban all parts with the ability to convert semi-automatic or any other type of firearm into a military-style semi-automatic weapon. We will ban parts that cause a firearm to generate semi-automatic, automatic or close to automatic gunfire.”  She continued, “In short, every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country.” The government will implement a gun buyback scheme after seeking advice from Australia on the matter according to Ardern. It seems her work to tighten gun control is far from over. “It is about all of us. It is in the national interest and it is about safety. I will work hard to retain that support as we work on the remaining tranches of reform that we must make to prevent an act of terror happening in our country ever again,” she said. The New Zealand Parliament has yet to vote on the proposed changes. Ardern’s quick crackdown has received praise from Democrats advocating for similar changes in the US. Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared Ardern’s ban to the US’s failure to implement any new gun control laws after deadly shootings such as the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, in which 20 children and six school staff died. “Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can’t even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market. This is what leadership looks like.” Democratic US Senator Bernie Sanders echoed a similar sentiment, tweeting, “This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like. We must follow New Zealand’s lead, take on the [National Rifle Association] and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.” Morocco has similar tough gun laws to Australia, with laws to regulate civilian access, mandatory background checks in place, and strict regulations in place on all types of guns from handguns to assault rifles.  Jacinda Ardern is also being praised for her decision not to give the Christchurch attacker any notoriety.  While speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, March 19, she expressed, “He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety – that is why you will never hear me mention his name.” Ardern urged people to “speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.” She also assured New Zealanders that he would “face the full force of New Zealand’s law.” Ardern also used the address to call on social media platforms to do more to combat extremism online, as the attacker live-streamed the shooting on Facebook for 17 minutes.  Speaking to Parliament, she said, “We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility.” In an official statement, Facebook said the live-stream was online for an hour before being removed and received over 4,000 views. The social media platform also said it had blocked 1.2 million copies of the video at the point of upload and deleted another 300,000.  According to Facebook, the alt-right website 8chan reposted the video to its own platform before Facebook removed it from the attacker’s profile.  BBC’s technology consultant Rory Cellan-Jones told BBC that even though it was an 8chan user who made the video go viral, he questioned “whether it was sensible to give between two and three billion people instant access to a live broadcasting platform Facebook must have known would be impossible to moderate in real time.” In a simple but powerful nod to the Muslim community, Ardern finished Tuesday’s address to Parliament by saying, “Al Salaam Alaikum. Peace be upon you, and peace be upon all of us.”

Rabat – Spain’s King Felipe VI and his wife Queen Letizia awarded the “National Prize for the Work of a Translator” to Malika Embarek Lopez, a Moroccan-Spanish translator at the National Culture Awards in Madrid on Tuesday.   Lopez, 74, has translated more than 50 books from French to Spanish and from Arabic to Spanish. The jury said they chose Lopez because of her profound dedication to translation and her bridging of different cultures through the many works she translates from the best of French and international literature. The National Award for Best Translation went to 61-year-old Spanish translator Salvador Pena. Lopez and other candidates won their awards in 2017 but only received them on Tuesday at a ceremony over which the King and queen of Spain presided at the Prado National Museum in Madrid. The ceremony awarded experts in areas such as arts, cinema, and literature. ​ Lopez joins numerous other Moroccans in receiving international awards in 2019. In the field of cinema, another Moroccan woman shone recently in Egypt. Last month, the Egyptian film industry honored the talent of Sara Kaddouri, 28, a sound designer, mixer, and sound recordist. Kaddouri, a graduate from Marrakech’s School of Visual Arts (ESAV), won the Cairo Film Society Award for “Best Sound Mixing.” Kaddouri was already a woman of many awards. In October 2018, she won a prize for “Best Sound Editing” for the film “Sheikh Jackson” at the third Arabian Cinema Awards. In February 2018, Kaddouri was awarded at Switzerland’s Festival Locarno for the film “Withered Green.”.  On March 16, a renowned Moroccan poet and novelist Bensalem Himmich won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award for his memoir “The Self: Between Existence and Creation.” The book is a window into Himmich’s intellectual stances and career as a novelist.

Rabat – A Venezuelan MP on a working visit to Morocco has thrown his country’s weight behind Morocco’s Western Sahara position, praising Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for settling the territorial conflict. Francisco Sucre, president of the Venezuelan Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday in Rabat that the international community should give more credit to Morocco’s efforts in finding a definitive end to the decades-long dispute in Western Sahara. “Morocco’s proposal, local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, is a welcome and wise initiative,” Sucre said, referring to Morocco’s 2007 plan to solve the Western Sahara territorial dispute. The Autonomy Plan seeks to establish a platform of autonomous local governments under Morocco’s watch. For Morocco, the point is to grant Sahrawi locals full autonomy while making sure that they remain connected to their “historical motherland”: Morocco. Sucre, who is known to support opposition leader Juan Guaido, said that Venezuela will unconditionally support Morocco’s plan once the international community intervenes to end President Maduro’s “illegitimate rule.” Referring to Guaido’s stance on Morocco’s plan for Western Sahara, Sucre said, “This is the position that we will defend in international forums and at the UN once we are fully established in our rightful place in Venezuela, after an end is put to the grip of the current regime.” He showed appreciation for Morocco’s support for Guaido, explaining that Venezuela’s Parliament had designated the 35-year-old as interim president on the grounds of power vacancy. Sucre was roundly dismissive of President Nicolas Maduro’s regime. Maduro, he said, won elections that “were not transparent” and were rife with irregularities, including “mass imprisonment or exile of opposition leaders and an abstention rate that reached 82 percent.” Morocco said it would support Guaido’s work to fulfill the “aspirations” of the Venezuelan people shortly after he announced that Maduro’s rule was illegitimate and declared himself interim president. The international community has since been divided, with the EU-US axis calling for the end of the Maduro regime, and countries like Russia, China, and Turkey dismissing international pressure as “interference in Venezuela’s domestic affairs.” For Sucre, ousting Maduro will “save Venezuela’s democracy and benefit the world and the region.” Sucre’s comments come as Morocco takes part in the second Geneva roundtable along with other parties in the Western Sahara conflict. The routable started Thursday, March 21, and is scheduled to end Friday. The UN hopes that the two-day event will pave the way for building trust and brokering the necessary compromises to settle the Western Sahara political stalemate. In recent years, Morocco’s increasingly assertive diplomacy has succeeded in securing international support for its position in Western Sahara. In addition to the French and the US governments, a number of African and Latin American countries have lauded the Autonomy Plan. It however remains to be seen whether Rabat’s turn toward South-South cooperation and versatile diplomacy will eventually pay off as it wishes.

Rabat – An exhibition on peaceful cohabitation and religious tolerance opened yesterday in Rabat to display centuries of peaceful life between different religious groups in Morocco. Called “Christian Presence in Morocco: Living Together,” the program sought to put a finger on Morocco’s reputation as “a singular civilizational model of harmonious living together.” The majority of the documents scheduled for the 10-day event date back to the reign of Moulay Ismail (1672-1727) when, according to organizers, Morocco allowed freedom of movement and conscience to the “faithful of other religions, such as Christianity and Judaism.” Under Moulay Ismail’s rule, the kingdom had trade and diplomatic ties with a number of Christian nations and kingdoms, including the Vatican. The exhibition is the result of collaboration between the Archives du Maroc and the Council of Moroccans Residing Abroad (CCME). At the opening ceremony, participants got glimpses into the history of dialog and alliances between Moroccan sultans and Christian Kings. The event, set to end with the arrival of the pope on March 30, is bringing together crowds of religious experts, historians, religion enthusiasts, and curious citizens to look into how Morocco accommodated its first Christian communities. While Morocco is mostly known for its history with Moroccan Jews, organizers insisted that, although relatively new, the experience with Christians was just as harmonious. “This exhibition aims at throwing a retrospective look on some unknown episodes of a shared history filled with strong values of forbearance, peace, and living together,” organizers said in the event’s official booklet. In organizers’ reckoning, celebrating a history of tolerance and peaceful cohabitation is far above nostalgic feelings of times past. For them, it is about showing young generations that Morocco’s diversity is a historical heritage to cultivate and uphold. Historian Jamaa Baida, the director of Moroccan Archives, said, “The purpose is to put an emphasis on [Morocco’s] historical togetherness and send a message to young generations.” The message, Baida elaborated, should aim at showing the youth that history has not always been the domain of binarisms and divisiveness now prevailing in many circles. He added, “We want to use this event to tell them, ‘here is what our history was like. The other is not necessarily an enemy to fight. They can live with us in mutual respect.’” By presenting historical documents like letters between Moroccan and Christian kings, photographs, administrative documents like birth and marriage certificates, organizers hope that the exhibition will ultimately show that Morocco has historically been “a meeting ground” for diverse religious and ethnic groups “whose political and religious rights were guaranteed by various Moroccan sultans.” The event coincides with the visit of Pope Francis, from March 30-31.
The pontiff will meet King Mohammed VI and representatives of Morocco’s growing migrant community. The pope’s visit is also set to celebrate difference and religious cohabitation in a world of increased human mobility and cultural mingling.

Rabat – Two studies of ancient DNA have shown that North Africans inhabited the Iberian Peninsula long before the Muslim conquest. The journal Current Biology published a study on the makeup of the Iberian population between 6,000 and 13,000 years ago. The journal Science published a second study on the origins of the population over the past 8,000 years. The studies proved the presence of North Africans in Iberia from the Bronze Age, when Iberia saw a dramatic genetic shift. Among the 271 ancient Iberians analyzed, researchers found many had DNA from central Europe, including one man buried in a central Spain Bronze Age site called Castillejo de Bonete. The DNA examination of the man’s 4,400-year-old skeleton showed it was from central Europe. They also found a 3,500-year-old skeleton of a local Iberian woman. Researchers discovered that one person buried between 2400 and 2000 B.C. had North African ancestry. After studying the DNA of a woman buried between 2000 and 1600 B.C., the researchers found that she had a North African grandparent.  The results only confirm that the Iberian countries were home to migrants from Central Europe and North Africa.

Rabat – The inaugural session of the 38th Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development’s Expert Committee (COM2019) elected Morocco, by acclamation, to chair a bureau of the 52nd session of the UN Economic Commission for Africa’s (UNECA) COM2019, meeting in Marrakech this week. The bureau includes a first vice president from Ethiopia, a second vice president from Zambia, a third vice president from Togo, and a rapporteur from Equatorial Guinea.  Morocco welcomed the decision made on Wednesday, March 19. “The election of Morocco as Chair of this Bureau is an honour and a responsibility,” Morocco’s Secretary General of the Ministry of Economy and Finance Zouhair Chorfi said in a press release.  The meeting of the expert committee, which runs until March 22, will discuss the evolution of the economic and social situation in Africa and assess the progress of regional integration of the continent.  Earlier this month, the director of UNECA, Lilia Hachem Naas, said COM2019 will discuss “the African Free Trade zone, which will foster intra-African trade exchanges along with e-commerce and digital,” among other things. In February, the Moroccan government council adopted a bill ratifying the agreement to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area. The bill has yet to be brought before Parliament for ratification. Created in 1958, UNECA is one of the five regional commissions of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. ECA is mandated to support the economic and social development of its member states, to foster regional integration, and to promote international cooperation for Africa’s development.

Rabat – Turkish intelligence, according to an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, found that the perpetrator of the New Zealand terror attack against two mosques visited Morocco, Croatia, and Israel. Turkish security services said that the 28-year-old Australian attacker visited Turkey twice in 2016. Turkish services are now cooperating with New Zealand law enforcement to investigate the murder to avoid possible future attacks, according to Erdogan, who published his op-ed in the Washington Post. The perpetrator, whom police arrested after the attack, filmed himself while he was shooting Muslims inside a mosque. The gunman killed 50 people and injured at least 50 more in the heinous attack. The suspect had also written a 74-manifesto expressing anti-immigrant views and implying that migrants with higher birth rates are displacing European populations. Muslims and non-Muslims all expressed support and solidarity with the victims and their relatives. As March 21 marks a week after the terror attack, the New Zealand government decided to air the Muslim call to prayer on Friday to honor the victims. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that the gesture translates the country’s “desire to show support to the Muslim community as they return to mosques, particularly on Friday.”

Rabat – Sahrawi activist and former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud has defended a young Polisario member who fled the Tindouf camps in Algeria and returned to Morocco. In a Facebook post, Mustafa Salma said that Salamo Al Mustafa Salma is not a “criminal.” The former officer quoted an official statement from Polisario accusing Al Mustafa of treason. Polisario’s laws prohibit Sahrawis living in the camps from returning to Morocco, calling it treason and punishable by more than 10 years in prison, according to Mustafa Salma. In a previous opinion published by Morocco World News, Mustafa Salma called on the international community to help Sahrawis seeking to return to their homeland by “putting pressure on the Polisario Front to lift its hand off the Sahrawi civilians.” Mustafa Salma also accused Polisario of holding Sahrawis as hostages for its interests. “The Polisario’s insistence on keeping the Sahrawis as permanent refugees, despite the end of the circumstances which caused them to be displaced (the armed conflict), demonstrates that the Front intends to keep them hostage to protect the interests of its leaders, including making profits by marketing the misery and suffering of the refugees in the camps.” In his Facebook post, Mustafa Salma asked several rhetorical questions, criticizing the Polisario Front and its treatment of Sahrawis living in the camps. “Is it not the right for everyone to leave and return to any country, including their own, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? Is not voluntary return to the homeland the best solution to refugee problems? Can any of the front’s supporters prove after this campaign and the campaigns that are conducted against returnees from the camps to their homeland, that freedom of movement is guaranteed to the camp residents, and that they are not being held?” Mustafa Salma asked. Several Sahrawis inside and outside the camps deplored the alleged unbearable living conditions in the camps, where thousands of Sahrawis live as refugees. In January, Mustafa Salma shared a lengthy comment on the condition of a family protesting lack of humanitarian aid and malnutrition in a sit-in at the UN mission, known as MINURSO, at Mijek in Western Sahara.  Several other Sahrawis also held protests to condemn corruption in the camps. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on the 29-year-old Al Mustafa on March 18, saying he was an officer in the front. The returnee introduced himself to the Moroccan army at the Moroccan defense line in the Farcia area of the Oued Draa region, where he arrived by Jeep. Al Mustafa is not the only Polisario member who returned to Morocco. Several others decided to come back to Morocco, including Ynja Khattat.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has called King Mohammed VI and requested Morocco to review their “brotherly relationship.” The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) announced the phone call in a statement on March 21. The phone call comes two months after Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita vaguely announced in an Al Jazeera interview that Morocco had withdrawn its troops from the Saudi-led coalition at war in Yemen against Houthi rebels. Many have speculated about the seemingly stormy relationship between Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Morocco took a neutral stance in the Saudi-led blockade on Qatar. A few days after the start of the blockade, King Mohammed VI asked the Moroccan government to dispatch food assistance to Qatar. In November 2017, King Mohammed VI flew from the United Arab Emirates to Qatar, being the first head of state to break the air blockade imposed on the small Gulf nation.  Morocco’s neutrality and its offer to mediate the Gulf crisis did not resonate with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who many regard as the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.  In the months leading up to a FIFA vote in which Morocco was vying to host the 2026 World Cup, an advisor to the Saudi royal family and Saudi sports authority Turki Al Sheikh made unfriendly comments about Morocco. Morocco lost the vote to the North American bid in June 2018. In February, Bourita denied Morocco’s relationship with Saudi Arabia was under stress after international media reported that Morocco recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mustapha Mansouri. Bourita said the ambassador had returned to Rabat for a consultation. The Moroccan move came after the Saudi pro-government Al Arabiya television channel aired a documentary on Western Sahara, which was viewed as hostile to Morocco’s position on the conflict. The documentary displayed Western Sahara as an “occupied” territory, making the Polisario Front’s claims legitimate. Moroccans also took offense when the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) posted on Facebook a map showing Western Sahara removed from the Moroccan map. It remains to be seen whether this phone call will contribute to rekindling the strained relations between the two countries and give them a new impetus.

Rabat –  A 47-year-old Senegalese-Italian abducted a school bus carrying 51 children in Milan and set it ablaze in a protest over Italy’s migration policy on Wednesday. Police rescued all of the children. Police reached through smashed windows at the back of the bus to rescue the children, some of whom were tied up, and arrested the driver. Some of the children managed to hide their phones and alerted the police who able to rescue them in time. None of the children received serious injuries, although 14 people experienced smoke inhalation, according to the BBC. The driver allegedly said “No-one will survive” as he set the bus on fire. One of the children told Italian reporters that the driver had threatened to pour petrol on them and burn them alive.  “It was a miracle, it could have been a massacre,” Milan chief prosecutor Francesco Greco said. The bus driver was reportedly angry over the Italian immigration policy and the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean. A teacher, who was riding along with the schoolchildren on the bus, said it was not the first time that the man drove a school bus with children inside. Meanwhile, a schoolgirl told Italian news outlet Ansa that the man kept repeating: “People in Africa are dying.” He said “it was the fault of Di Maio and Salvini,” referring to Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio and the far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini. In September 2018, the Italian government approved a decree proposed by Salvini, suspending the asylum process for the “socially dangerous” undocumented migrants who are not “escaping war.” Salvini also blocked NGO rescue ships from entering Italian ports to reduce the number of migrants arriving in Italy by sea. The bill, according to Salvini, was a “step forward to making Italy safer.”

Rabat – On Friday, one week after a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that cost the lives of 50 people, the country will broadcast Friday’s call to prayer on national television in memory of the victims. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced: “There is a desire to show support to the Muslim community as they return to mosques, particularly on Friday.” There are also initiatives from women in New Zealand to wear headscarves to show support for the Muslim community.   Anna Thomas, who started the initiative called “Scarves in Solidarity,” said: “Just thought why don’t we all wear a scarf on Friday, a week on from this tragedy and walk alongside our Muslim sisters as a mark of respect.” Meanwhile, families of the victims have begun to bury their loved ones. Christchurch’s Al Noor Mosque will open its doors on Friday for the first time since the massacre. On Tuesday, March 19, MPs in the New Zealand Parliament started their meeting with a recitation from the Qur’an by Imam Nizam ul haq Thanvi. During her speech at the parliamentary session, Arden expressed: “Our strength as a nation is our compassion and our welcoming of diversity. This will not change us … We [don’t] consider ourselves Christian or Muslim, Sikh or Jew, Maori or Pakeha, Chinese or Pacific Islander, Indian or any other ethnicity. Today and forever we are all New Zealanders.” “March 15, 2019, will forever remain etched in the memory of New Zealanders,” said Arden. In memoriam of the victims, many New Zealanders showed sympathy, mourned, visited mosques, and placed flowers on memorials. The main shooter, 28, was charged last Saturday with murder and will also receive further charges, according to prosecutors.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) announced it received a letter from FIFA to approve Moroccan-Dutch football player Oussama Idrissi’s request to represent Morocco instead of the Netherlands. On March 18, FRMF said that the footballer, who currently plays for the Dutch Az Alkmaar football club, would play with the Atlas Lions against Malawi on Friday, March 22. The game is Morocco’s final qualifier match of the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Morocco has already qualified for the competition. Idrissi will also be in the lineup of the Moroccan team playing a friendly game against Argentina on March 26. Idrissi, who announced his decision to play for Morocco in February, said that he is “very proud” and “honored” that he will join the Moroccan national football team. “I will represent my country as a real Atlas Lion,” he said. “I was born and raised here [Netherlands] with the standards and values of this beautiful country. As a Muslim you basically follow the culture of your father. And my father is Moroccan,” Idrissi explained. Ahead of the Morocco-Malawi game, Morocco’s head coach Herve Renard shared his lineup, calling 18 football players for the game. According to FRMF, the 18-player list includes:

Rabat – Morocco has made South-South cooperation a priority of its foreign policy, said Mohamed Methqal, the director general of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), on Tuesday in Buenos Aires. Methqal addressed a meeting on French-speaking economic spaces and South-South cooperation at the second high-level UN Conference on South-South Cooperation, meeting March 20-22. He said that, for two decades, King Mohammed VI has made foreign cooperation the major pillar of his foreign policy. The King has made 50 visits to African countries and signed 1,000 agreements. Methqal highlighted the strong Moroccan presence in Africa in the banking sector. Moroccan banks are present in more than 30 African countries, he said.  Morocco is also working to develop structuring projects, the flagship project of which is the Morocco-Nigeria Pipeline, added Methqal. The project will serve “13 West African countries and promote competitiveness and improve production costs.” Morocco’s bid to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is in line with the endeavor to link Europe and Africa in a network of tripartite cooperation. However, ECOWAS has not accepted Morocco’s application, and Morocco faced “political and social opposition within ECOWAS,” according to Carnegie Endowment. In Nigeria, a major coalition of trade unions, industrialists, and NGOs lobbied the government not to open its borders to Moroccan products. The lobbyists said that Moroccan imports would undermine domestic production. The UN Conference on South-South Cooperation is the world’s largest South-South cooperation meeting. It is taking place 40 years after the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Under the action plan, developing countries defined the approach to technical cooperation, an aspect of South-South cooperation that relies on the exchange of experience and knowledge transfer between the Global North and South.

Rabat – The criminal chamber at the Fez Court of Appeals has sentenced the president of Oujda municipality, Omar Hijra, and the president of the Oriental region, Abdenbi Bioui, to two years and one year in prison for corruption. The criminal court found Hijra, a member of the Independence Party (PI), and Bioui, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), guilty in 2017. The two had appealed their convictions. Sentenced on Wednesday, Hijra will face two years in jail, and Bioui will serve one year on charges of fraud and embezzlement of public funds. The charges followed a report by the Court of Auditors showing several “suspicious” transactions made between 2006 and 2009 in the region of Oujda in northeast Morocco. The report noted an unjustified expenditure of MAD 40 million originally allocated for development projects in Oujda. Fifteen others involved in the same scandal, entrepreneurs and department managers, were also sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to two years. The conviction of the two officials is one of the many instances of Morocco’s fight against corruption. Corruption costs Morocco approximately 7 percent of its GDP every year, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said in July 2018. The country annually loses 2 percent of its economic growth due to different forms of corruption—abuse of power, public funds mismanagement, or administrative corruption, according to Lahcen Daoudi, minister delegate to the head of government in charge of general affairs and governance. In August 2018, King Mohammed VI removed an entire department within the Ministry of Equipment to “enhance integration and consistency between all the bodies concerned with water management in the ministry.” The department was the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water, headed by Charafat Afilal. It was another surprise move after the King sacked the minister of economy and finance, Mohamed Boussaid, in the wake of an annual report by the Court of Auditors on Morocco’s financial situation in 2017. The report, which focused on the management of the accounts handled by all ministers, revealed management dysfunctions in more than 100 accounts by general directors, senior officials, and ministers.

Rabat – A few hours ahead of the second UN roundtable discussion on Western Sahara, Moroccan television channel 2M announced that Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met with the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Kohler. Kohler also met with the other delegations representing Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario. Algeria’s newly appointed foreign minister Lamamra Ramtane will represent Algeria in the meeting. Ramtane took his post amid nationwide protests in Algeria against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s government. Thursday, March 21 marks the first day of the second roundtable’s working sessions. The working session of the second roundtable will begin at about 2 p.m. in LeRosey Place, 30 kilometers from Geneva. Both Morocco and Mauritania decided to send the same delegations as they did during the first roundtable. State-owned channel 2M said that Mauritania’s foreign minister Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed will lead his delegation. The Polisario Front has not announced the members of its delegation yet. The roundtable comes after a series of separate consultations between Kohler and the parties in the last few months. Following the consultations, Kohler sent invitations to the second roundtable he had promised at the end of the first roundtable, which took place December 5-6 in Geneva. The United Nations said on March 19 that the second roundtable will take place in  “accordance with UN Security Council resolution 2440 as a further step in the political process towards reaching a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution.” The roundtable’s purpose, according to the UN, is for the parties involved in the conflicts to “start approaching elements needed for building an enduring solution based on compromise.”

Rabat – The Spanish interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, highlighted Morocco’s efforts to fight migrant smuggling networks on Wednesday, March 20. The efforts of the Moroccan authorities in this area “are leading to a decline in arrivals of migrants to the Spanish coasts,” the minister said in a meeting on migration in Malaga, southern Spain. According to a statement from the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, Grande-Marlaska explained that “coordination with the countries of origin and transit in the fight against these networks has led, since February, to a decline in migrant arrivals that is being confirmed during this month of March.” He underlined the need for increased cooperation with countries of origin and transit. Morocco, a transit country, has been asking the European Union for funding to combat irregular migration, arguing that it cannot act alone. Spain, as a gate to Europe, has also been collaborating with Morocco to control migration at their border. The EU gave both Spain and Morocco €70 million each in aid in October 2018, “mainly for the purchase of border control equipment,” according to Spanish news outlet El Pais. In total in 2018, the EU pledged €148 million to financially assist Morocco for border control and job creation to improve migrants’ living conditions.   The most recent financial aid Morocco received was €30 million, announced by Hungary. The package was approved at a summit between eastern European prime ministers and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February. Last year, Morocco thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts according to government figures, up by 37 percent from the previous year’s statistics. From January 1 to December 18, 2018, Europe received 111,558 migrants across the Mediterranean, with Spanish ports receiving 50 percent of all migrants who entered European ports, according to the International Organization for Migration.  Moroccans form 31 percent of the irregular migrants who arrived in Europe in 2018; 20 percent are from Guinea, and 16 percent from Mali.

Rabat – A new overview of Morocco’s economy for 2019 from the Oxford Business Group has presented a positive view of Morocco’s plans to address unemployment and other issues challenging the country. Despite increasing external debt, Oxford Business Group forecasted a flourishing future in Morocco’s economy, thanks to aeronautics and several other industries. For Oxford, “a rapidly improving business environment and infrastructural base, the gradual liberalisation of the local currency and increased investment into export-oriented industries are all set to raise living standards and drive the emergence of a large national middle class.”  For this to happen, the report advised Morocco’s senior officials to put “more effort into overcoming entrenched socio-economic problems and stubborn unemployment.” Morocco’s industrial plans might rescue youths Socio-economic issues, like social disparities, migration, and unemployment, heavily impacted Morocco’s performance in recent years. Protests across the country emerged in recent years, pointing out lack of job opportunities, lack of healthcare, scarcity of potable water, and a poor education system. In 2016 and 2017, protests circled the Rif region in the north with protesters decrying social disparities. The protests were sparked by the death of a local fishmonger in Al Hoceima province who was crushed in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated. In 2017, demonstrations swept eastern Morocco after several informal mining workers died inside illegal mines. In the same year, locals in the southeastern desert city of Zagora protested water shortages. The government addressed citizens in the aftermath of each protests by promising reforms and economic plans to curb socio-economic issues. One of the plans created amid protests and unemployment was the Industrial Acceleration Plan 2014-2020. According to the Ministry of Industry’s  description, the plan focuses on aeronautics, seeking to offer 23,000 new jobs in the sector by 2020. The strategy received applause in the report, calling it a “general strategy for industrial development that seeks to create 500,000 new jobs in various industrial sectors including automotive, agro-industry, textiles, aeronautics and fishing by 2020.”  “The programme, which started in 2014, created 52,376 jobs in 2016 and almost 90,000 in 2017.” The report commented, “Authorities have also adopted a new National Plan for the Promotion of Employment in early 2018, which includes an emphasis on better education and training, as well as the organisation of a conference aimed at developing a national employment roadmap.” A recent note from the High Commission of Planning (HCP) noted a decrease in unemployment rate. HCP said that the rate dropped from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018. The commission said that Morocco’s economy created 112,000 jobs, 91,000 in urban areas and 21,000 in rural areas. Despite the slight progress, Moroccans, especially young people, complain of unemployment. The Oxford report said unemployment “remained elevated yet stable in recent years, despite the uptick from 9.9% in 2016 to 10.2% in 2017.” Gaps in unemployment rates between urban, rural areas Like other international and local reports, the Oxford Business Group found a gap in the rate of unemployment in urban and rural areas, with “the former standing at 14.3% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 3.9% in the latter.” The report also took into account age, recording that the youth unemployment rate is 27.5 percent. “The kingdom suffers from underemployment, and 9.7% of the working population is underutilised.” Oxford also mentioned Morocco’s plan to ensure employment for youth through vocational training. Last year, King Mohammed VI urged the government to use vocational training as a tool to fight unemployment. “Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided it receives the attention it deserves and as long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope,” King Mohammed VI said on October 12, 2018. Describing vocational training as a priority, the report said: “Plans for legal reform in the sector and efforts to improve vocational training are currently under way to ensure that the skills of young Moroccans better match the needs of the private sector.” Promoting economy via investment in industries: Successful strategy Trade, international corporations, aeronautical and automotive sectors are at the heart of Morocco’s strategy to ensure a better business performance. The outlook of the report said that Morocco’s plans to promote economic development through investment “has witnessed success, in particular in the automotive and aeronautics sectors.” Oxford said that industry contributed an average of about 19 percent to GDP, and “in 2017 this increased, raising the sector’s contribution to around 25% of GDP.” Oxford also forecasted an additional growth of 5 percent in the industry sector by 2022.

Rabat – The prominent Islamic scholar and television commentator Tariq Ramadan, 56, surprised a Paris suburb municipal conference on “Combating Daily Violence against Women” when he showed up uninvited. Ramadan’s presence irritated attendees and organizers of the event. The municipality of Saint-Denis released a statement noting, “Neither the municipality nor the participants has invited Ramadan nor wished his presence.”  The organizer of the event, Madjid Messaoudene, confirmed in a tweet that Ramadan had not been invited.  French prosecutors indicted Tariq Ramadan on three charges of sexual assault of women in February 2018. Ramadan refused to leave the conference, even after being asked, according to the municipality.  Ramadan’s refusal to leave was an “insult to the people shocked at his attendance,” the statement read. Attendees instead left in protest of the scholar’s “provocative” and “ignoble” presence. The municipality of Saint-Denis asserted, “The presence of Tariq Ramadan at the conference is unacceptable and indecent.”  The municipality stressed that it was unjustifiable that a debate on such an important issue be “pestered” and “hijacked” by Ramadan’s provocative presence.  Le Figaro journalist Fatiha Agag-Boudjahlat described Ramadan as a religious hypocrite, arguing that his presence was in itself violence against women. French authorities arrested Tariq Ramadan early in 2018 on allegations of sexual assault and rape. He was placed in solitary confinement and, according to his lawyers, denied medical care for his multiple sclerosis.  Ramadan faces five rape charges. In October 2017, two women brought charges of rape against Ramadan over incidents in 2009 and 2012.  A third women stepped forward and accused Ramadan of rape later. Ramadan acknowledged having relations with the woman but argued it was consensual. The case was dismissed. Ramadan served up to 10 months in jail during the investigation into the series of allegations against him. The French judiciary released Ramadan on a $340,000 bail in November 2018.  Ramadan’s case drew a number of sympathizers globally. Thousands have signed a petition demanding Ramadan’s release, including American intellectual Noam Chomsky, Islamic scholar Amina Wadud, British journalist Peter Oborne, and Leila Ahmed of Harvard University.  A French court denied Ramadan’s request for dismissal of the charges in July 2018. According to Ramadan’s supporters, the French justice system treated him differently from others with similar charges because he is Muslim.

Rabat – On International World Happiness day, March 20, the annual World Happiness Report 2019 showed that Morocco ranks 89th out of 156 countries. The report ranks countries on individuals’ assessments of their lives, which researchers say align with six key variables that support well-being: Freedom, income, the absence of corruption, healthy life expectancy, social support, and generosity. Morocco lost four places as it ranked 85th in 2018.  Morocco’s happiness primarily came from low dystopia, GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy. In contrast, perceptions of corruption, generosity, and freedom to make life choices contributed less to happiness in Morocco. Morocco is currently one place behind its neighboring country, Algeria, which ranks 88th. Across the Maghreb, Tunisia ranks 124th, Libya 72nd, and Mauritania 122nd. Several Arab countries rank relatively high, mainly the UAE (21st), Saudi Arabia (28th), and Qatar (29th). In the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco ranks as the eighth happiest country; Algeria seventh; Libya sixth; Kuwait fifth; Bahrain fourth; Qatar third; Saudi Arabia second; and the UAE is the happiest country in the MENA region. Finland is the happiest country in the world, followed by Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands in the top five. Not only are the native-born residents happy with their lives in the top happiest countries, but also the immigrants there, said the report co-editor John Helliwell, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of British Columbia. Switzerland ranks in sixth place, followed by Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, and Austria. Meanwhile, Canada ranks 9th, the US ranks 19th, France 24th, and Spain 30th. Published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the report is “a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.” The 2019 version is the seventh annual happiness report. In terms of fundamental rights and absence of corruption in Morocco, The World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index ranked the North African country 74th globally, falling from 67th place in its 2018 report.

Rabat – Police in Tangier have seized 80 kilograms of cocaine and 6,915 psychotropic tablets, according to a statement issued by Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN). Police also announced they arrested two suspects involved in drug trafficking. “A search operation carried out as part of this case resulted in the seizure of a large amount of money in dirhams, suspected of being obtained from drug trafficking, as well as two knives and a car,” added the statement. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation. A new report from the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) found that cocaine is one of the most common drugs in Morocco. Psychotropic tablets, including opioid painkiller tramadol, are also popular. The report recalled Morocco’s operation seizing 541 kilograms of cocaine in February 2018 in Casablanca. Morocco made another significant seizure in December 2018 when the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested an international drug trafficking network and seized 1 ton of cocaine. The Moroccan government announced last year that Morocco seized 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstacy pills in 2018. In addition to crackdowns on drug trafficking, Morocco has put in place programs to offer treatment to drug addicts. Morocco’s health ministry said that 27,620 drug addicts received treatment at rehabilitation centers in 2018. Minister of Health Anas Doukkali announced that Morocco is committed to fighting drug use and drug trafficking.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) made MAD 5.4 billion in net profits and MAD 55.9 billion in gross revenues in 2018. The net profits were up 19 percent and the gross revenue was up 15 percent from 2017. OCP reported the figures in its preliminary annual results on Tuesday. The revenue increase is mainly due to higher phosphate prices in international markets thanks to a steady demand for phosphate and its derivatives and increased raw material costs. The world’s leading fertilizer company, OCP said that its earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), were MAD 17.1 billion in 2018, up by 34 percent from 2017. The company reported that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2018 were MAD 11.3 billion, up by 71 percent from 2017.  OCP will release its full fourth quarter and annual 2018 results on Monday, March 25.

Rabat – Sousi Ab is a Moroccan-Dutchman who has been traveling the world on his bike since May 3, 2018. He is documenting his mission to travel from Suriname to Mecca through his Instagram and Facebook pages. Ab grew up in Morocco but now lives in the Netherlands. Ab began his journey in May 2018 in the South American country of Suriname. He traveled around the country, forming relationships and exploring new places. Along his journey, he discovered another Moroccan in Nieuw Nickerie, Suriname, who moved to Suriname in 1987.  Ab spoke to the Moroccan man, who has yet to return to Morocco since his departure. The man’s children were born and raised in Suriname and now have strong Surinamese accents. Amused by the Moroccan-Surinamese boy’s accent, Ab uploaded a video of the man’s son speaking, which has since received over 24,000 views on Facebook.   In addition to Suriname, Souisi Ab traveled to Guyana, Venezuela, Italy, and Russia, among other countries. Ab visited Russia over the summer during the World Cup and met other Moroccans who were in Russia to support the Moroccan football team.   During Ab’s travels, his main mode of transportation is a bike. He visits various mosques around the countries which he explores. Ab is currently traveling through Brazil and intends to arrive in Mecca at the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Ab is one of almost 380,000 people of Moroccan descent living in the Netherlands. Moroccan-Dutch people represent 2 percent of the Netherlands’ population, according to the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics. Of Dutch people with immigrant backgrounds, Moroccans are the third-most populous in the Netherlands, after the Turkish and Surinamese, according to SpringerLink.

Rabat – Morocco deeply regrets and denounces UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers Diego Garcia-Sayan’s decision to cancel his official visit to the country. The Moroccan government addressed Garcia-Sayan’s statement, published Tuesday, March 19, on the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) website, in which he declared that he would not visit Morocco on an official trip set for March 20-26. Garcia-Sayan said he canceled the visit because the “government of Morocco has not been able to ensure a programme of work in accordance with the needs of the mandate and the terms of reference for country visits by special procedures.” In response, the Moroccan government stated that Garcia-Sayan’s decision contradicts his earlier stand when he first began preparations for the visit on June 16, 2017, at the invitation of Morocco. According to the government, Morocco has been keen on ensuring all the necessary “guarantees” for the success of Garcia-Sayan’s visit by including all the suggested places for him to visit to exercise his mission, contrary to what the rapporteur stated. Garcia-Sayan stated: “It is most regrettable that the suggestions of places to visit and schedule of work were not fully taken into consideration by the Government. It is an essential precondition for the exercise of the mandate of Special Rapporteur that I am able to freely determine my priorities, including places to visit.” Morocco stressed the country’s readiness to make any amendments Garcia-Sayan requested to enable him to exercise his mandate as required. Lastly, the Moroccan authorities regretted that Garcia-Sayan, instead of approving Morocco’s proposal to guarantee the success of his visit in the country, considered it a shortcoming from Morocco’s part, which is what Moroccan authorities strongly denies. Garcia-Sayan’s visit was to examine the independence and impartiality of judges and prosecutors and the independent exercise of lawyering.

Rabat – A spokesperson of ISIS, Abu Hassan Al Muhajir, has called for revenge nearly a week after a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The self-styled spokesman said in a 44-minute voice recording that the massacres “should wake up those who were fooled and should incite the supporters of the caliphate to avenge their religion.” The terrorist attack on two mosques killed 50 people and injured at least 50 more on Friday, March 15. Al Muhajir also criticized the White House’s comments on victory over ISIS, saying it is in a “state of confusion and contradiction that make it impossible for any observer to know what is meant by the word ‘victory.’” On Tuesday, March 19, Syrian democratic forces said they had captured ISIS final stronghold in Syria, although “isolated gun battles are continuing,” according to American media outlet NPR.  US President Donald Trump had announced the end of ISIS in Syria in February. “We just took over … you kept hearing it was 90 percent, 92 percent, the caliphate in Syria … now it’s 100 percent,” said Trump. Troops on the ground denied Trump’s announcement, emphasizing that it was “100 percent not true.” The New York Times also reported that journalists denied that ISIS had surrendered all of its territory in February. The Moroccan government, which partners with the US in counter-terrorism, also warned that the fight against ISIS is a long-term project. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, said in December 2018, “No one should say that the ISIS threat has ended.” He argued that the war against the terror group will take a long time. Khiame’s comment was echoed by Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit earlier this month in Tunisia. The Moroccan official said that the fight against terror is a long term issue and the first action needed to stop the spread of extremism is to end its ideological sources.

Rabat – Five months after a deadly train accident in Bouknadel, north of Rabat, the Court of First Instance in Sale has adjourned the trial of the train driver, Laarbi Rich. The trial will resume on March 26.  After the train he was driving derailed near Bouknadel, between Rabat and Kenitra, on October 16, 2018, killing seven and injuring 150, the train driver was placed under police detention. Rich has been in detention for five months now.  The Sale court adjourned the case on Tuesday, March 19. “I told what I’d seen,” the defendant said at yesterday’s hearing. The public prosecutor charged Rich with murder, accidental injuries, and causing the train to derail by driving 158 kilometers per hour. The speed limit on that particular stretch of track was 60 kilometers per hour at the time.  Rich’s defence said there was no evidence to convict him, and Rich may sue the government. “We reserve the right to bring an action against the state to recompense the defendant for the time he’s spent in jail.” The defence instead blamed staff at the National Office of Railways (ONCF) for not communicating with the driver. They also said the train did not have automatic braking, and the driver did not have a display screen.  Referring to videos allegedly deleted by ONCF staff in violation of Article 58 of the criminal procedure code, Rich’s lawyers said some evidence was corrupted.  If convicted, Rich faces between five months and five years in prison and a fine of MAD 250 to to 1,000, as stipulated by Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code.  The defence also cast doubt on the credibility of witnesses. “They would risk their jobs for clearing the driver of guilt.” The accident stirred wide public outrage on social media, where users blamed the accident on ONCF. A ONCF employee claimed the state-owned rail company was well aware of the malfunctioning of the track days before the accident.  They launched an online campaign under hashtags “#Baraka” (enough is enough) and “#Boycott_ONCF” to express their disapproval.

Rabat – Bank Al Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, has announced mixed prospects for the Moroccan economy for 2019. In a statement published on March 19 following the quarterly meeting of the BAM board, the body estimated that Morocco’s cereal output will go down in this year’s harvest. From 100 million quintals last year, Morocco’s grain production is set to decrease to 60 million quintals in 2019, according to BAM’s predictions.
The institution assessed, however, that the decrease should not be a cause for alarm. BAM stressed that the downward spiral will not be continuous, indicating that cereal production will again go up in 2020. From 60 million quintals produced this year, 2020 will see an increase of 20 million for a total production of 80 million for that year. The drop in productivity will affect Morocco’s growth rate, according to BAM. Rather than the initial 3.2 percent growth prediction at the start of 2019, BAM’s latest announcement indicated that Morocco’s 2019 growth rate will be around 2.7 percent. As with grain production, however, the growth rate is also expected to pick up strength by 2020. The expected rate for 2020 is 3.9 percent. Meanwhile, BAM envisions maintaining the interest rate at 2.25 percent. One silver lining in the bank’s relatively bleak assessment is the reduced unemployment level. While unemployment and the lack of prospects for young Moroccans continue to be major concerns for Moroccan authorities, there has been an overall decrease in the unemployment level, down from 10.2 percent in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2018, according to BAM. In urban settings, however, the rate barely changed, from 14.7 percent in 2017 to 14.2 percent in 2018. Unemployment is highest among young Moroccans aged 15-24. One explanatory factory of Morocco’s rough year in terms of public finances, BAM suggested, had to do with the considerable drop in the development funds it received from its usually generous Gulf donors, such as Saudi Arabia. Even in more propitious times, BAM’s predictions have generally been moderate. “In an uncertain international environment marked by persisting trade and geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, Brexit concerns, and market volatility, macroeconomic risks remain generally moderate,” BAM had said in its December assessment of Morocco’s 2019 prospects.

Rabat – The Moroccan House Speaker Habib El Malki explained that Iran did not attend attend last week’s Parliamentary Union of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Member States (PUIC) in Rabat because “the Iranian delegation did not respect all the rules of participation in the session” and arrived in large groups of up to 40 people. Rabat hosted the 14th PUIC March 11-14. El Malki said on Tuesday, March 19, in a press briefing, that as the host country, Morocco had requested the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to ask its member states to reduce the sizes of their delegations. Iran did not abide by the request, according to El Malki. “It is customary to respect instructions requested by the host country,” El Malki stated. He emphasized that “Morocco fulfilled all the requirements” of the PUIC secretary-general, Mouhamed Khouraichi Niass. El Malki’s statements respond to reports claiming that the Moroccan government did not allow two diplomats who formerly worked at the Iranian embassy in Rabat to participate, leading to the entire delegation to refuse participating altogether. The delegation allegedly arrived at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport but were forced to return “without explanation” according to Niass, following the event. Iran did not comment on its delegation’s absence—led by Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani. In the wake of Iran’s absence, at the opening of the PUIC Executive Committee which was held as part of the 14th PUIC session, El Malki urged the OIC member states to set aside their “differences” and work on resolving them through dialogue. El Malki then stressed in a speech that the OIC should adopt internal dialogue to overcome their differences and that “having different views is the essence of democracy, which should bring benefits to people despite their differences.” Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran in May 2018, saying that Iran gave financial and military support to the Polisario Front through its proxy, Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militant group.

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, called for the depollution of the African Union of “sterile, useless and out of step with reality” debates about Western Sahara. On Tuesday, March 19, Bourita spoke at a joint briefing with his Rwandan counterpart Richard Sezibera. Sezibera co-chaired the first session of the Morocco-Rwanda Joint High Commission.  Morocco and Rwanda are working together to advance the AU reform agenda. Such reforms are implemented with the goals of making African voices heard at the international level, launching integration projects, and developing the AU as a more effective instrument for the continent. Sezibera said that his country is committed to doing what it takes to achieve a “fair and equitable solution to the question of the Moroccan Sahara.” Bourita spoke in favor of Kigali’s role in the AU as upholding a “spirit of realism” when it comes to the issue of Western Sahara. Previously, the African Union has moved to limit its role in the Western Sahara dispute. In July 2018, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, released a report which supported the United Nations’ authority on the issue. The report stated that the UN was the only body with full legitimacy to find a mutually accepted solution to the dispute. The AU’s role going forward would be to simply support the UN in its efforts. The AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) would no longer have the right to discuss the issue of Western Sahara. The change was widely seen as a win for Morocco which has long believed that AU-led efforts are biased against the Moroccan claim.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the official delegation, including foreign minister Nasser Bourita, which will take part in the second roundtable discussion on the Western Sahara conflict March 21-22 in Geneva, Switzerland. Bourita will again lead the delegation, which will include Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale; the president of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid; the president of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, Ynja Khattat; and a member of the Smara municipal council, Fatima Adli. Laayoune, Dakhla, and Smara lie within Western Sahara in southern Morocco. The Moroccan delegation received its invitation from the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler. Kohler invited all the parties involved in the conflict, Polisario, Algeria, Mauritania, and Morocco. The meeting in Geneva is part of the UN move toward future negotiations to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco will be going to the second roundtable to confirm its commitments to the UN-led political process and to reiterate its position that it will accept no solution to the conflict outside its sovereignty and autonomy plan. In January, Bourita said that the autonomy plan seeks to integrate Sahrawis in development plans and to preserve the Moroccan Sahrawi heritage. The United Nations said on Monday that the second roundtable, in accordance with UN Resolution 2440, is a further step in the political process. The statement added that it would be an opportunity for the parties to “revisit regional issues and discuss how to build trust.”

Rabat – The UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Diego Garcia-Sayan, has announced the cancellation of his visit to Morocco, initially scheduled for March 20-26. Garcia-Sayan had to cancel his visit to the country because the Moroccan government failed “to ensure the necessary conditions for his visit.” “The Government of Morocco has not been able to ensure a work programme consistent with the needs of the mandate and the terms of reference for country visits by special procedures,” he said in a statement published in the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) website. Garcia-Sayan added, “It is most regrettable that the suggestions of places to visit and schedule of work were not fully taken into consideration by the Government. It is an essential precondition for the exercise of the mandate of Special Rapporteur that I am able to freely determine my priorities, including places to visit.” He took to Twitter to reiterate why he canceled the trip. “I had to cancel the mission on judicial independence to Morocco that began today. When a State does not provide adequate facilities it is not serious to carry out a mission,” tweeted Garcia-Sayan on Tuesday. The UN human rights office stressed that “governments are obliged to guarantee and facilitate [special rapporteurs] freedom of movement and freedom of inquiry.” Garcia-Sayan’s visit was to examine the independence and impartiality of judges and prosecutors and the independent exercise of lawyering.

Rabat – Juan Guaido‘s interim government in Venezuela is fulfilling its commitments to restore diplomatic ties with Morocco.  The National Assembly, under the leadership of majority leader Juan Guaido, announced the appointment of Jose Ignacio Guedez as a plenipotentiary ambassador to Morocco. The assembly appointed the ambassador during a plenary session on Tuesday, March 19. Five others also received appointments as diplomats for Europe and North Africa. According to a statement from the National Assembly, “These new appointments are in addition to those already made by the Venezuelan Parliament, under the tutelage of Juan Guaido, president (E) and head of the National Assembly.” Guedez is the secretary-general of the leftwing Venezuelan Radical Cause (La Causa R) party and president of the Ibero-American Association for the Democratic Cause (ACDI). The appointment followed Juan Guaido’s promises to restore diplomatic ties with Morocco after a decade of tension between Venezuela and Morocco over the Western Sahara conflict. After declaring himself interim president of Venezuela, Guaido said that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s position on Morocco has not been beneficial for both counties. In March, Guaido expressed gratitude for Morocco’s support for “the aspirations of the Venezuelan people” after he spoke with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in January. During the conversation, Bourita said that Morocco supports all the actions Guaido is taking for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change. Following Morocco’s comments, Guaido expressed special thanks to Morocco. Morocco broke ties with Venezuela in 2009 because of its support for the Polisario Front. Senior officials from Guaido’s interim government promised that the cabinet wants to turn a new page with Morocco, promising to reconsider Venezuela’s recognition of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

Rabat – The Economist Intelligence Unit has released its annual survey on the world’s most expensive cities, ranking Casablanca 92nd out of 133 cities. Casablanca has become comparatively more expensive since last year, when it ranked 112th most expensive city. The study is based on the cost of 160 goods and services, such as housing, food, and transport. The think tank compares cities’ cost of living to New York’s, the benchmark. Casablanca ranked more expensive than the other two North African cities the Economist surveyed, Cairo (114th) and Algiers (123rd). It is the first time in the survey’s 30-year history that three cities tied for being the most expensive cities worldwide: Singapore, Hong Kong, and Paris. Rounding out the top 10 are Zurich (fourth); Geneva and Osaka (fifth); Seoul, Copenhagen, and New York (seventh); and Tel Aviv and Los Angeles (10th). In the top 10 cheapest cities surveyed are Caracas (133rd), Damascus (132nd), Tashkent (131st), Almaty (130th), and Bangalore (129th), Karachi and Lagos (127th), Buenos Aires and Chennai (125th), and New Delhi (124th).

Rabat – The Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) announced that 40 new flights will connect Morocco to Turkey, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy in summer 2019. Other new flights will link major Moroccan cities and Greece, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, and Portugal as of this summer. Eight airlines will launch 40 extra flights to Morocco: Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, Britain’s EasyJet, Turkish Airlines, Air Arabia, Spain’s Vueling Airlines, the Netherlands’ Transavia, Spanish low-cost Volotea Airlines, and Germany’s Condor Airlines. Marrakech is gaining the most new flights. With 19 new flights to the ocher city, Marrakech is followed by Tangier, Fez, Tetouan in the north, Agadir, Ouarzazate—south of Morocco’s High Atlas, and Dakhla in southern Morocco. Some of the  40 flights will operate more than once a week for a total of 85 new flights weekly, on top of the 1,200 existing flights per week. The flights will add 456,686 new seats. For flights between Charleroi, Belgium and Essaouira, Ryanair will take over from the Belgian TUI Fly airline, which recently suspended its flights there, said ONMT in a statement. In addition, starting April 15, Vueling will launch flights between Malaga in southern Spain’s Costa del Sol and Marrakech. Vueling’s flights will be operational on Mondays and Thursdays every other week. The airline will offer travelers 20,160 extra seats from Malaga to 24 national and international destinations. Ryanair and Greece’s Aegean Airlines also recently announced they would launch new flights to several Moroccan cities in the 2019-2020 winter. Morocco is a growing destination for international tourists. Last year, the North African country received 12.3 million tourists, according to ONMT. Marrakech, one of Morocco’s most popular destinations, recorded over 2.4 million tourist arrivals from January to November in 2018 and had 2.6 million scheduled hotel stays through the end of the year. Morocco is among the safest travel destinations around the world, considered safer than the US, France, and Italy according to Which?Travel’s November 2018 report relying on assessments by the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the World Economic Fund.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah has called for cities to review their public lighting systems to ensure greater energy efficiency. Rabbah was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 5th African Energy Efficiency Meetings on March 13 in Casablanca. “Cities have an interest in reviewing their street lighting system to minimize this expense and use the savings in other services,” Rabbah said. He argued that public lighting is a “trigger” for moving toward sustainable cities but did not give a reason why. Rabbah gave the example of the transportation sector, the main consumer of energy. particularly fossil fuels. The transportation sector consumes about 38 percent of the fossil fuels Morocco consumes. He also pointed out that the construction sector consumes almost 32 percent of the fossil fuels in Morocco. He considered that implementing “sustainability logic” requires starting with triggers, success stories, and niches where there are fewer constraints and more opportunities. Casablanca Mayor Abdelaziz El Omari noted the need to implement a national sustainable development strategy at the regional level.  “This is precisely the role of local communities and cities,” he continued. He pointed out that  Casablanca is paying a “bill of MAD 150 million just for public lighting”. El Omari said Casablanca has delegated water and electricity management to private companies.  He cited a request for bids to set up a waste recovery unit for energy production. “We had 11 international companies interested in producing energy from waste.” Rabat Mayor Mohamed Sadiki emphasized the importance of shifting to energy efficiency outreach and awareness since “words alone will not make our country an African and global leader in this field.” “In this sense, we must encourage studies that complement architectural studies in terms of housing design that meet this energy efficiency objective,” he argued. Sadiki said that Rabat, although a “green city” in his view,  faces a water consumption challenge.  Speaking about public lighting in Rabat, he said, “We have not yet made a decision on the management model for this energy-intensive sector.” He added that the annual cost of public lighting is MAD 85 million. Morocco has an energy management challenge. Many officials “mismanage” energy resources, according to Hespress. The National Energy Strategy, effective 2009, identifies energy efficiency as a national priority to achieve energy savings of 12 percent by 2020 and 15 percent by 2030. In 2011, the Energy Efficiency Act (47-09) was enacted, setting limits on the energy consumption of equipment and devices like household appliances, buildings, and vehicles and providing incentives for energy efficiency in road transport, buildings, and industry, subject to assessments and audits. “Energy efficiency is … the fourth most important energy resource,” the law states. One result of the energy efficiency policy was adopting Daylight Saving Time time, GMT+1, in the summer 2008. When the government decided to shift to a year-round GMT+1 in October last year, hundreds of protesters took the streets.  It remains unclear whether the government’s move is final, pending the release of an official study on the effects of permanent DST, especially on school students, according to Morocco newspaper Alousboue.

Rabat – Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport ranked as one of the best airports in Africa in 2018 according to a survey by Airports Council International (ACI). Based on ACI’s Airport Service Quality (ASQ) ranking, released on March 6, the Casablanca airport and Durban airport in South Africa ranked as the best in Africa in 2018 for customer service for passengers, the Moroccan National Office of Airports (ONDA) stated in a press release. The Mohammed V International Airport earned its ranking among other airports in Africa with 5 to 15 million passengers per year. The distinction recognizes the continuous efforts of ONDA to enhance customer experiences in Morocco’s busiest airport, ONDA asserted. The Mohammed V International Airport will receive an award at the “ACI Customer Excellence Global Summit” ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, September 2-5. ACI grants yearly awards for customer service at airports according to ASQ surveys which measure customer satisfaction. ACI initiated the prize to highlight good customer service. ASQ surveyed more than 650,000 passengers across 376 airports in 90 countries. As Morocco’s busiest airport, Mohammed V International Airport welcomed 9.7 million passengers in 2018 only. Ninety percent of the passengers were on international flights. It is a hub that connects Africa with the rest of the world and has been recognized as standing up to standards set by the International Organization for Standardization. In contrast, another survey conducted last year ranked Casablanca airport as the worst in the world. Surveying more than 50,000 travelers in 2018, e-Dream, an online travel agency, concluded that Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport was “the world’s worst airport,” with a score of 3.5 out of 5.

Rabat – A new study, published in time for International Francophonie Day on March 20, has found that only 35 percent of Moroccans speak French. Annually conducted by the French Language Observatory, the report assesses the progress of the French language and future prospects for young French speakers. Despite the low percentage of Moroccans with French fluency, however, the country is North Africa’s second highest French user. It ranks above Algeria (33 percent) and Mauritania (13 percent). Tunisia leads the dance with 52 percent. Despite a reputation that suffers from France’s colonial history, the French language continues to appeal. According to the report, most of the MENA region’s French-speaking populations positively relate to the language. Between “80-100 percent want their offspring to speak French,” while 40-80 percent put efforts into teaching their children themselves. The study established that the largest cohort of foreign students in French learning institutions come from sub-Saharan Africa and the MENA region countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Lebanon. “Mastery of French is a treasured skill in the professional and academic worlds in the [MENA] region,” the report said. It elaborated on the history bonding France with many of the Francophone countries, highlighting the remains of cultural proximity that continue to guide young students towards French. But the Francophone appeal is not only cultural or historical, according to the study. On the economic front, many parents and students in Francophone countries prioritize French because it opens doors to employment and business prospects. “While French has not liberated itself from the stains of the colonial period, it retains a comfortable position in the minds of its speakers as a language for school,” the study noted. French speakers perceive the language as “modern and useful for work and business.” The report comes against the backdrop of an intense linguistic debate at the Moroccan Parliament. While French is not the country’s official language, it still subsumes Arabic and Tamazight (Berber), especially when it comes to administrative paperwork and communication in the highest echelons of Moroccan political life. Morocco’s middle class tend to use French as their operational language, and the country has a vibrant publishing market for literature in French. Some of Morocco’s most popular authors write in French. The same is true in other North African countries, where mastery of French is associated with higher social status because French classes are taught in expensive private schools. In Morocco, the French-speaking “grandes ecoles,” the highly selective engineering and business schools, as well as prestigious high schools mostly operate in French. Recently, education minister Said Amzazi introduced a bill to teach scientific subjects in foreign languages from primary school onwards. The current medium in the majority of Moroccan primary schools is Arabic. The debate has deepened the identify gulf among Moroccan MPs. Conservative parties like the ruling PJD are calling for more “Arabization” to uphold the country’s “authentic identity,” while progressive parties assert that embracing foreign languages will serve Morocco better as it seeks to be part of global scientific dialogues and breakthroughs.

Rabat – The governor of Bank Al Maghrib (BAM), Abdellatif Jouahri, announced Morocco’s plan to issue two international bonds, each worth MAD 11 billion, on Tuesday, March 19. BAM plans to issue one bond this year and the second in 2020. The government bonds are loans made by investors to the government, which will pay interest at a set rate. The overall treasury debt is set to increase from 65.0 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in 2018 to 65.8 percent in 2019 before going back to 65.0 percent in 2020 as a result of a decline in domestic debt, according to Jouahri. Jouahri made his remarks during BAM’s first quarterly meeting of the year on Tuesday, when he analyzed recent economic developments and BAM’s macroeconomic forecasts for the next eight quarters. Prior to the official announcement, Jouahri had been promising international bonds since September 2018. Other than Islamic bonds Morocco issued in September 2017, the bonds will be Morocco’s first since 2014, when the country sold €1 billion of “10-year Eurobond with a yield of 3.7 percent,” according to Reuters.  Morocco’s senior officials, including Jouahri, have been heavily warning against taking on too much external debt as the country continues to borrow to carry out socio-economic projects. One of the latest loans was from the European Investment Bank, which granted Morocco’s roads authority €80 million to complete highway infrastructure projects in Casablanca. Last year, Jouahri said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2019, up from 13.8 percent of GDP in 2018. The latest Fitch report also criticized Morocco’s credit rating based on statistics from the first half of 2018. The report found that Morocco’s debt policy has not changed much since 2007, noting high credit risk due to low reserves in Moroccan banks. On Tuesday, Jouahri announced that he responded to Fitch London, saying, “We remain at delinquency rates that are stabilizing.” Jouahri added that his letter to Fitch answered “argument by argument.” “We maintain our positions, even with an international benchmark. We are not a banana central bank. They know that. The Moroccan central bank is not to be taken like this.” Jouahri’s forecast also estimated an easing of the external deficit and strong foreign exchange reserves. The governor, however, expects the budget deficit to increase.

Rabat – Morocco and China signed an MAD 140 million economic and technical cooperation agreement on Tuesday, March 19, in Rabat. The agreement will finance joint public projects. Morocco’s minister of economy and finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, and the ambassador of China to Morocco, Li Li, initialled the grant agreement. Since Morocco exempted Chinese citizens from getting visas before arrival in June 2016, Chinese investment and the number of Chinese tourists in Morocco has increased, said Benchaaboun. With increasing numbers of tourists, the two countries announced  in January a direct flight connecting Casablanca to Beijing or Shanghai, to open between late 2019 and early 2020. Li commented that the financial aid will help the two sides launch pilot projects in the technology and education sectors in Morocco in the near future. China will support economic and social development in Morocco, he said. Li told the media last week that East-West cooperation should be understood in terms of “plurality” rather than from a “geopolitical” perspective. He spoke at the 6th Africa Development International Forum (FIAD) in Casablanca on March 14 and 15. Organized by Attijfariwafa Bank, FIAD brought together 2,000 entrepreneurs and banking experts. In February, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah said Morocco is becoming a partnership hub as a link between China and the rest of Africa thanks to major reforms and partnerships under Morocco’s Africa policy. China announced its Belt and Road global development strategy in 2013. The strategy established the Maritime Silk Road, a trade sea route connecting China to Europe through East Africa. Although it lies in northwest Africa, Morocco is relevant to China’s plan. Morocco is eight miles away from Europe, a major trade partner of China. The Strait of Gibraltar separating Spain and Morocco is a strategic global trade location.  Its position on the map, as well as its Africa investment policy, made Morocco fit into China’s Belt and Road initiative.  China made a number of investments in Morocco’s cultural, education, and technology sectors, laying the foundation for the long-term Belt and Road project. In January 2018, Morocco and China agreed to establish a research institute focusing on “Belt and Road Studies,” according to news outlet China Daily. In March 2017, the Confucius Institute, a state-affiliated organization promoting the Chinese language and culture, opened in Tangier. Moroccan students are also interested in China. Chinese universities are the second most popular destination for African students after France, according to UNESCO. Most of them come from East African countries, Morocco, and Cameroon, reported University World News. In the technology sector, King Mohammed VI launched Tangier Tech in March 2017, a smart city to be built in the next 10 years. China’s Haite group will help finance the $1 billion project. Tangier Tech plans to host 200 Chinese companies.

Rabat – A group of Danish tourists has visited Imlil, a village in the Atlas Mountains, where two Scandinavian tourists were horrifically killed, to show the world that Morocco is a safe country with hospitable people.  Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath reported on March 19 that young tourists, of similar ages as the murdered tourists, arrived in Imlil on Saturday. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were killed on December 17.  The 110 Danish tourists went to Imlil for a three-day visit, and local authorities welcomed them warmly and ensured them a safe trip. Police found the bodies of Louisa and Maren in an isolated area near Imlil on December 17 in an apparent terrorist attack. Moroccan police arrested more than 20 people in connection to the crime in the weeks that followed the tragedy. The court case is ongoing. Suspects involved in the crime may receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison.

Rabat – The secretary general of the opposition United Socialist Party (PSU), Nabila Mounib, asserted that the Moroccan government has failed the education system. After her party released a statement in solidarity with contractual teachers, Nabila Mounib has for the first time spoken out. “The Moroccan government failed teachers and the education system through its destructive reforms under the guise of progress and development,” she stated. She explained that through its 2015-2030 strategic vision for the reform of education, training, and scientific research, the government passed a “destructive education reform bill,” a reference to Law 17-52. “The strategic vision, which seemingly champions equal opportunity and good quality education, falls short of expectations. Morocco’s plans for education reform is like poisoned honey,” Mounib argued in an interview with Achkayen news outlet on March 17. She maintained that the 2015-2030 strategic vision failed Moroccans. Passed on August 20, 2018, Law 17-52, would impose school fees at secondary schools and universities. Mounib said it is a blow to poor families, who she said make up 90 percent of the population. She said it “weighs heavily on poor parents who cannot afford to pay school fees.” Mounib called on teachers unions to form a strong “popular front” with trade union leaders, activists, and politicians to fight for better education reform. Referring to the government’s recruitment of teachers by contract, Mounib stated that the alarming shortage of teachers can never be bridged unless teachers are employed in the public sector. Mounib stressed the government should integrate contractual teachers into the public sector to guarantee them ongoing and sustained training and, by extension, good quality education and fair competition. Mounib argued that unless the situation of teachers is addressed quickly, the government will soon be “driving in the final nail in the coffin of the public school.” She believes public schools are Morocco’s “last hope” to develop. In an interview with the Khabar Maghreb news outlet after a PSU conference, Mounib said that the “state policy pursued by the Moroccan government with regard to education has marginalized the youth and tricked them into believing that the government is instructing them.” On March 5, following strikes and demonstrations by contractual teachers, Nabila Mounib’s PSU declared in an official statement its support for contractual teachers. “We have to be very mindful when it comes to privatization,” she said. “No single country has ever developed by privatizing its education system. Conversely, privatization is one way of undermining it.”

Rabat – MPs in the New Zealand Parliament opened Tuesday’s session with a recitation from the Qur’an, a tribute to the 50 Muslims who died in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Imam Nizam ul haq Thanvi recited verses from the Qur’an at the Parliament today for the souls of people killed in the attacks. MPs, wearing black, observed a moment of silence and listened to the recitation. During the session, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke of the terror attacks, saying that her country would not give the shooter the fame he sought and would not speak his name. “He sought many things from this act of terror, but one was notoriety. And that is why you will never hear me mention his name,” she added. “He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.” March 15, 2019, will forever remain etched in the memory of New Zealanders, said Arden. The attack which shook New Zealand and the world last Friday evoked “a lot of soul-searching, reflection, sadness, anger and shame across New Zealand,” said Arden. “Our strength as a nation is our compassion and our welcoming of diversity. This will not change us … We [don’t] consider ourselves Christian or Muslim, Sikh or Jew, Maori or Pakeha, Chinese or Pacific Islander, Indian or any other ethnicity. Today and forever we are all New Zealanders, “Arden expressed. Last Saturday, wearing a headscarf to show respect, Arden visited the families of the victims and promised to ensure their safety in mosques and the rest of the country. The prime minister also signed a condolence book for the Muslims killed in the terror attack. “On behalf of all New Zealanders, we grieve together. We are one. They are us,” Arden wrote. In memoriam of the victims, many New Zealanders mourned, visited mosques, and placed flowers on memorials. In Morocco, the Wydad Casablanca (WAC) football club at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, recited Al Fatiha, the opening surah of the Qur’an, to express support for the families of the victims. The main shooter, 28, was charged last weekend with murder and will also receive further charges, according to prosecutors.

Rabat – Morocco’s successful anti-terrorism system has won plaudits from outside observers and experts, winning the country a reputation for security and a minor level of radicalization. Beneath the calm and reputably tolerant Moroccan Islamic tradition, however, an influential Islamist movement has been at war with what it perceives as an ungodly, over-Westernized, and illegitimate monarchy. Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane (Justice and Spirituality), an Islamist association founded in 1973 by Moroccan religious teacher Abdesslam Yassine, is perhaps the most well-known and wide-reaching of Morocco’s grass-roots Islamist movements.
Since the late 1970s, the movement has grown its outreach to other continents and regions, including Europe and North America. Based on an encompassing Islamist philosophy that seeks to integrate the religious, the personal, and the political, the group is known for its trenchant criticism of the Moroccan political sphere. While perceiving modern government as too Westernized, the movement has maintained that the monarchy is “illegitimate” and unreflective of “God’s promise” for Morocco. Key to its position is its rejection of the King’s status as “commander of the faithful.” For all its vitriolic attacks on the country’s political scene, however, the group is at the forefront of Moroccan political life. Most notably, the followers have been known to be bedfellows with the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), Morocco’s ruling party. Between Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane and the PJD, the French-language magazine Jeune Afrique observed in its March 10-16 edition, there has been a documented interplay of both convenience and mutual-attraction. Despite their piercing criticism of PJD and its “inability to properly rule Morocco,” many followers of Justice and Spirituality are die-hard PJD supporters when it comes to voting. In some instances recently, a number of influential PJD leaders, including justice minister Mustapha Ramid, were quick to rise to the movement’s defense whenever there was a perceived threat—social or judicial—to the group’s properties. Recently, however, the PJD-led government seems to be at the forefront of measures to limit the Sufis impact on Moroccan society. By seizing properties affiliated with the group, the Moroccan government is increasingly turning against a movement it tolerated for decades. In February alone, the government shut down close to 20 Al Adl Wa al Ihsane-affiliated buildings—mostly group leaders’ private properties and meeting halls— in Fez, Oujda, Kenitra, Tangier, and other cities. As far as the movement’s followers are concerned, the government’s turn on their association is repression. They say they are being targeted for no reason. Describing the shutting down as a case of “private property violation,” Fathallah Arsalane, the movement’s spokesperson, told Jeune Afrique that it was an “illustration of how liberties have regressed in Morocco.” Abdelouahed Moutawakil, the head of the movement’s political branch, went further. For him, recent crackdowns smell of power abuse and vendettas. He argued that the measures constitute a political decree against an association whose impact is deemed threatening to the “makhzen,” Moroccan slang for the deep state. Moutawakil called the crackdowns “political decisions and illegal measures against a movement known for its criticism of the regime.” The makhzen, he stressed, is only interested in “muzzling” opposition. But, he warned, “The [government’s] offensive will only consolidate [Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane’s] ranks and broaden its audience in the path to the realization of the divine promise.” For some experts, however, monitoring the followers, curbing their impact on Moroccan society, and raising the public’s awareness of the threat the group supposedly poses to national stability, is an overdue step. The movement is particularly feared for its textual interpretations of the Qur’an, which critics say fuel its radicalization potential. Jeune Afrique wrote that reports from Moroccan security authorities have estimated that 200 of its followers have been linked to terrorism-related activities in Morocco. Police arrested one follower in early 2018 after the person attempted to explode a natural gas cylinder near a tourist bus in Meknes, a city near Fez. Others have generally been arrested before they could act on their plans. “In its ideology, Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane seeks to help the Muslim world emerge from the impiety in which it seems it is plunged,” said one person Jeune Afrique called an “expert.” To reach that goal, the expert noted, the movement’s modus operandi is to infiltrate all sectors to disseminate its ideology. Social movements across Morocco have notably provided the group with the opportunity to “infiltrate” communities. According to the Jeune Afrique article, the group has been quick to “capitalize” on recent incidents of anti-government fervor, including the 20 February movement, the Hirak demonstrations, and many others. Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane’s strength, experts have overwhelmingly agreed, lies in its mobilization potential and the family-inspired emotional attachment it establishes between its followers. To disenfranchised youth, the group is said to offer a community of brothers and sisters who shower them with the support that society withheld. Under the guise of social and psychological assistance to needy populations, the movement, according to Moroccan authorities, recruits what it calls “jounoud Allah” (God’s soldiers), to lead its longstanding dream of “Islamizing modernity.” Like other major MENA Islamist movements, the group wants to “internationalize jihad,” according to Jeune Afrique. One crucial factor for the proliferation of Islamist groups in the MENA region has been the financial and social support that such groups avail to scores of disaffected youth. Moroccan authorities have traditionally stepped up to defuse the radicalization potential of groups like Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane. Since 2015, the country has engaged in an array of reforms to cement its reputation as the hub of a tolerant and diversity-friendly Maliki interpretation of Islam. In addition to investing in the visibility of female Islamic clerics, Rabat has sought to establish itself as the exporter of Africa’s new generations of imams. The Ulema or Mohammedia League of Scholars, Morocco’s highest body of Islamic clerics, has notably proposed that Muslim countries embrace modernity and the changing socio-historical context of their societies. It called for action to curb the proliferation of “textual and erroneous” interpretations of the Qur’an, urging Moroccans to “resist the trap of radicalization.” That call came in the aftermath of the Imlil murders as Morocco sought to emerge from the shock of Morocco’s first terrorist attack since 2011. But the Mohammedia League’s accommodation of modernity is at odds with Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane’s founding philosophy. Unlike the Ulema, the group believes that non-Islamic modernity should never be an ally; it is the ultimate enemy. “Winning the modern world for Islam,” founder Abdessalam Yassine’s 2000 book spelled out his legacy. The goal of the struggle, he suggested in the book, is to build the future of the world through Islamist lenses. That means, Yassine explained, a future that is not “lulled and content with that hectic madness[modernity]… deafened by the noise of the new, blinded by the sheen of colored images, dazzled by incessant flashbulbs, seduced by the magic of the ‘electronic superhighway,’ dumbfounded by bursts of virtual reality.”

Rabat – The senior Muslim cleric, who advises the Australian government on Islamic issues, was planning to fly to Christchurch to support the Muslim community as they bury the victims of the terror attack before he was told by New Zealand authorities not show up to the airport as he did not have a special visa.   “I was shocked. It’s sad to see something like this happen, especially during this time of challenges and difficulties,” Alsuleiman told the Sydney Morning Herald.  Denmark also barred Alsuleiman from entering the country in April 2018, after Denmark introduced a law barring certain preachers from entry, including Alsuleiman. The Danish law imposes a ban on those that “display behavior that gives reason to believe the foreign national could pose a threat to the public order.” Immigration New Zealand (INZ) Denmark’s sited Denmark’s decision as the reason why Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman was refused entry to the country. “[INZ] can confirm that Mr. Alsuleiman was advised that he was unable to travel to New Zealand visa-free as a result of being excluded from Denmark,” said national border manager Stephanie Greathead. However, the decision was soon overturned after Shady contacted Australia’s Department of Homeland Affairs who put pressure on New Zealand to grand the Muslim cleric a special visa, which they did so less than 24 hours after the complaint was made. Greathead followed up her statement by saying “Because of the exclusion he required what’s known as a special direction enabling a visa to be granted. Taking into account all the circumstances Mr. Alsuleiman has now been granted the special direction and a one-month visitor visa.” Alsuleiman previously came under fire from the Australian government after a video emerged of the cleric saying homosexuality spreads diseases. The prime minister at the time, Malcolm Turnbull, who had an Iftar dinner with the cleric just a week before, denounced the statements as “unacceptable.” Alsuleiman released a statement in response, saying “I have previously noted passages in the holy Quran which do not support homosexuality, however, I always follow such statements with a personal commitment to tolerance and encouragement that all Muslims and all people approach all individuals, no matter their faith, race or sexuality, in a considerate and respectful way.” Alsuleiman is also notably on the ISIS’ hit list, after a terrorist propaganda video called for his murder because he advocates against violence in the name of Islam, and encourages Muslims to “follow the laws of the land.” Australian Imams Council spokesman Bilal Rauf commented on New Zealand’s original decision to bar Alsuleiman, telling the Sydney Morning Herald “We don’t understand the reasons why he has been placed on the list,” he said. “That’s something that Sheikh Shady will inquire into and seek to address.” “It’s unfortunate to see that sometimes screening matters are not getting correctly done,” he added. The Sheikh will now fly to New Zealand on Wednesday, and he said was “not going to make any assumptions” regarding why he was denied entry to the country initially.

Rabat – Omar Ilhan, a US Muslim congressman who recently faced a slew of scathing criticism for her alleged anti-Semitism, has said that modern day Israel is the legitimate and historical home of Palestinians. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Sunday, March 17, the Somali-American congresswoman set out to clarify her positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Delving into the history of the displacement and suffering of both Palestinians and Jews, she argued that, like displaced Jewish refugees, Palestinians, too, should be granted the right to return to their homeland. “The founding of Israel 70 years ago was built on the Jewish people’s connection to their historical homeland, as well as the urgency of establishing a nation in the wake of the horror of the Holocaust and the centuries of anti-Semitic oppression leading up to it. Many of the founders of Israel were themselves refugees who survived indescribable horrors,” she wrote. The remarks distanced her from criticism lambasting her previous comments for lacking both historical insight into the Israel-Palestine conflict and sympathy for her Jewish constituents. But, she added, “We must acknowledge that this is also the historical homeland of Palestinians.” Under current circumstances, Palestinians are without a state and are condemned to “a state of permanent refugeehood and displacement.” The core of Omar’s message was that Palestinians, too, deserve to have a fatherland and benefit from all the advantages that come with full citizenship, from free movement to the right to equal and dignified treatment. Omar urged the US government to prioritize an “inclusive and balanced” crisis management approach whose purpose will be to take into account both parties’ inherent desire for justice, freedom, and security. “I support a two-state solution, with internationally recognized borders, which allows for both Israelis and Palestinians to have their own sanctuaries and self-determination,” she wrote. In February, Omar sparked uproar on both sides of the American political spectrum for suggesting that the Jewish lobby and money are the primary reasons behind sustained US support for Israel. In that episode of bipartisan criticism, there was a particular focus on one of Omar’s old tweets that said Israel has been “hypnotizing” the world to its misdeeds in “occupied Palestinian territories.” Critics said “hypnotize” is among the most used of “anti-Semitic tropes” in recent history. Omar appeared to want to set records straight. “When I criticize certain Israeli government actions in Gaza or settlements in the West Bank, it is because I believe these actions not only threaten the possibility of peace in the region – they also threaten the United States’ own national security interests,” she asserted.

Rabat – The UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) will hold a conference, beginning on Wednesday in Marrakech, focusing on three main topics: Fiscal policy, trade, and the private sector. The secretary general of the Ministry of Finance, Zouhair Chorfi, reviewed the conference’s aims at a press conference at the ministry’s headquarters in Rabat on Monday, March 18. The director of the UN ECA, Lilia Hachem Naas, co-chaired the press conference and said the conference will discuss “the African Free Trade zone, which will foster intra-African trade exchanges along with e-commerce and digital.” Chorfi stressed the importance of digitalization, which he said “will open new horizons in Africa.” He said the conference will pay special attention to digital challenges. The UN ECA’s 52nd session of the Conference of Ministers of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development will meet March 20-26. Talks will revolve mainly around the relevance of African education and training systems in an evolving, digital, and knowledge-based economy. It will encourage exchanges of views from different outlooks and opportunities for Africa to respond to the future of work. The conference will include a series of plenary sessions bringing together ministers from within and outside Africa, expert panelists, government officials, labor and employer organizations, international organizations, researchers, and civil society organizations. Coinciding with King Mohammed VI’s address last week at the Crans Montana Forum in Dakhla, Morocco, this event will reportedly be in line with what the King underlined: Africa’s demographic advantages, sustainable development, youth dynamism, and digitalization. “These aspects are a challenge not only to the African countries but also to the entire world, which requires adequate solutions,” Chorfi stressed. He noted, “Africa’s population is among the youngest with an average age of 19.” Chorfi particularly highlighted unemployment among the youth and said it will be discussed at the Marrakech conference. The conference will host more than 20 side events to speak to pressing issues in Africa, including one session on “Gender-sensitive budgeting: a strategic instrument for economic transformation and inclusive development in Africa.” On January 30, during a two-day visit in Morocco, the executive secretary of UN ECA, Vera Songwe, signed an agreement with the Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun on the organization of the 52nd conference in Marrakech.

Rabat – Students at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, came together to pay tribute to the victims of a terrorist attack on two mosques, when a man performed the adhan, the call to prayer, inside the university. A video showing hundreds of students showing solidarity with the victims of the shooting has been going viral on social media. It is the latest in a series of gatherings taking place across New Zealand to show solidarity with the victims. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also visited Al Noor Mosque, where the attack occurred on Friday, March 15. Wearing a headscarf to show respect to Muslims, the prime minister was captured in photos and videos hugging Muslim women to show her support for the Muslim community in New Zealand. New Zealanders also took hundreds of flower bouquets to the mosque. Some people expressed support for the victims in a uniquely New Zealand way. Hundreds of students performed the famous Maori haka dance to honor the victims. The students gathered at a park across from Al Noor Mosque on Monday to perform the dance. Haka is used to mourn the dead and to show love and compassion with the families of the victims. The New Zealand dance traditionally involves a group of people stamping their feet. In addition to New Zealand, Australia, and other countries across the globe, Moroccans also condemned the terror attacks on social media and in demonstrations.  On Saturday, March 16, a group of people protested in front of Parliament in Rabat to show solidarity with the victims. Fans of Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca football club also showed solidarity on Saturday by reciting surah Al Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Qur’an

Rabat – Many Moroccans believe the justice system protects wealthy people at the expense of others, according to a survey by the Hague Institute for Innovation of Law (HiiL). The study on justice needs and satisfaction in Morocco, carried out between July and September 2018, examined Moroccans’ experiences with legal problems in the previous four years and how they deal with legal problems. HiiL knocked on the doors of 6,000 people in all 12 regions of Morocco for face-to face interviews. They found that almost one out of every two adult Moroccans had to deal with one or more legal problems in the four year period. “This implies that every year there are around 3.9 million people who have to deal with one or more new legal problems.” Crime, family problems, conflicts between neighbors, and land disputes are the most frequently occurring problems. People perceive legal problems as very serious, especially for domestic violence, family disputes, and employment conflicts. “To achieve a fair resolution for their problems, people are willing to spend around 2100 MAD or 220 USD…. People who are faced with a land dispute are most willing to pay a substantial sum to have their problem resolved, at 4,200 MAD,” said the study. Moroccans are divided in how they think courts treat different members of society. “One in two people perceive that courts often protect the interests of the rich and powerful over those of ordinary people.” The study found that 29 percent of people believe the courts generally protect the interests of the rich and the powerful more than the interests of ordinary people “very often.” Twenty-five percent believe it happens “often,” 34 percent “rarely,” and only 13 percent answered “never.” HiiL asked Moroccans how much they trust five institutions: Courts, informal justice mechanisms, the police, the government, and NGOs. People who have experienced a legal problem reported significantly lower levels of trust.  “Trust in the government is lowest out of the five. Trust is lower among people with higher levels of income or formal education.” The study found that 62 percent of legal problems are not resolved, and employment disputes are considered to be more difficult to resolve. Even after taking action, a significant number of problems remain unresolved which “increase personal suffering and even undermine trust in the justice system itself.” Young people and those with a lower level of income are less likely to resolve their problems. “Only two in ten crimes, land disputes, and domestic violence issues are completely resolved. One in two crimes is abandoned altogether,” HiiL reported. HiiL concluded by recommending the Moroccan judiciary system increase the availability of professional sources of legal advice and implement online dispute resolution as an enhancement and alternative to traditional dispute resolution.  The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported the study, in collaboration with Morocco’s Judges Club and ADALA.

Rabat – Cyclone Idai is likely the worst tropical storm to hit the southern hemisphere, with upwards of 1.8 million people affected in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, UN officials have said. The cyclone made landfall in Mozambique at approximately midnight on Thursday, March 14, before moving inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi. It hit the Mozambique city of Beira as a high-end Category 2 storm with wind speeds up to 175 miles per hour. Beira, a low-lying coastal city on the Indian Ocean, has been cut off from the rest of the country. Aid workers were only able to reach the city on Sunday, days after the storm first hit. All roads leading into the city have been cut off since a dam burst following the storm, flooding the last road into the city. UN aid workers report that 90 percent of Beira is destroyed. “No building is untouched.” Lack of medical care for the injured worsened the scale of devastation. All hospital activity in Beira and its surrounding areas has ceased completely, said Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi fears the numbers of dead will spike dramatically as more information is collected. The official death toll in Mozambique is at 84. But “everything indicates that we have a record of more than 1,000 dead,” said Nyusi in an address on national radio on Monday. Nyusi spoke of seeing “bodies floating in the water” after the Rivers Pungue and Buzi broke their banks “wiping out entire villages and isolating communities.” “This is a real humanitarian disaster of large proportions,” Nyusi said, warning that upwards of 100,000 people are in danger. If Nyusi’s prediction is accurate, Cyclone Idai will be the deadliest tropical storm in recorded history to hit southern Africa. According to MSF, 56 people have died and 600 are injured in Malawi. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cross Societies (IFRC) described the damage as “massive and horrifying.” Echoing Nyusi, IFRC warned that the death toll will likely rise sharply as more is learned. A resident of Mangochi in southern Malawi told Morocco World News that beyond the immediate damage, the heavy rains would have a devastating impact on the maize harvest this year. “In most of the southern region 50% will not harvest hardly anything. Of those who will harvest something, maybe they will only harvest 45-55% of what they are used to.” With a note of optimism, however, he noted that people “who planted rice will have a great harvest.” In Zimbabwe, at least 98 people have died and 217 are missing. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, returning home early from a trip to the United Arab Emirates, made a disaster declaration for the affected areas. The cyclone triggered floods, wrecking hundreds of homes in the eastern and western parts of the country, said authorities. Zimbabwe is currently gripped by an economic crisis, making many worry about its ability to withstand the inevitable financial impacts of the cyclone. The country of 15 million was already suffering from a severe drought before the cyclone hit. The UK government has promised humanitarian aid worth £6 million in addition to tents and shelter kits to Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Even as the countries scramble to deal with the logistics of dealing with such widespread destruction, some officials keep the larger picture in mind. Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty deputy regional director for southern Africa, spoke of the ways in which this cyclone indicates a larger trend in climate change. “The devastation wrought by Cyclone Idai is yet another wake-up call for the world to put in place ambitious climate change mitigation measures,” she said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance signed off on a $700 million loan from the World Bank on March 14, launching extensive reforms for Morocco’s digital economy. The program is the World Bank’s latest project in Morocco, part of their five-year “Country Partnership Framework,” which the two launched in February. The framework laid out the World Bank’s priorities for Morocco of job creation and human capital.  The release of the plans came at a “critical juncture” for Morocco economically, the World Bank said, pointing to the kingdom’s deepening reforms and upward—if sluggish—economic growth.  Now, its newest loan has brought the digital economy to the center of development efforts in Morocco. Social inclusion through digital transformation Less than one-third of Moroccans have access to a bank account (29 percent), substantially lower than the 44 percent average across the MENA region. A lack of access to such basic financial services—financial exclusion—hinders entrepreneurship and holds back economic growth. The World Bank’s project will address the issue in part through digital transformation. Its reforms will expand the range of broadband internet and scale up the use of electronic transactions.  The intended result, it said, is an “inclusive digital ecosystem” for Morocco. “Digital entrepreneurship is central to the current program,” said Djibrilla Issa, a financial sector specialist at the World Bank, in a press release. He explained that the project’s reforms would “unleash the potential of Morocco’s digital start-ups.” Issa said that an enhanced digital economy will particularly benefit Moroccan women, who often face greater barriers for financial services. The World Bank will monitor the results of its reforms on the gender gap in the workplace. A longstanding relationship with Morocco The World Bank’s latest project in Morocco is the latest chapter of their “longstanding, multisectoral engagement” with the country, it said.  The World Bank scaled up its work in Morocco in 2010 and have since lent the country an average of $748 million annually, through projects that have addressed everything from pollution management to rural infrastructure. Only Egypt receives more money from the World Bank than Morocco, of MENA region countries.  At the March 14 signing ceremony, Moroccan Minister General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi quashed rumors that the World Bank had imposed its own agenda on the kingdom with such projects. “The World Bank is a good partner for Morocco,” he said, noting that the project lines up with the Moroccan government’s stated development goals, such as its five-year program. The World Bank also approved an MAD $700 million loan in February to help Morocco fight unemployment—one of the 18 other World Bank projects presently active in Morocco.

Rabat – The United Nations issued  a statement on Monday, March 19, announcing the second roundtable discussion on the Western Sahara conflict will be held March 21-22. The statement said that the personal envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, invited all parties involved in the conflict to Switzerland for the roundtable. The meeting will convene Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, and Polisario in “accordance with UN Security Council resolution 2440 as a further step in the political process towards reaching a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution.” The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said that the purpose of the second roundtable is for “delegations to start approaching elements needed for building an enduring solution based on compromise.” Guterres added that the roundtable would be an opportunity for the delegations to “revisit regional issues and discuss how to build trust.” The statement announced that Kohler has held bilateral consultations with all the attending delegations to prepare for the second roundtable. “He hopes the meeting will consolidate the positive dynamic created by the first roundtable, that was held in December 2018.” The Moroccan government has not yet announced who will be in its delegation. In the first meeting, held December 5-6, 2018, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita led a delegation of several elected Sahrawis, including the president of the Dakhla region, Khattat Ynja. All of the parties concerned shared positive impressions on the first roundtable. While expressing readiness for negotiations, Morocco said that it will not accept a solution to the conflict outside its autonomy plan, territorial integrity, and sovereignty over its southern provinces. Morocco’s state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press has not yet shared any statement regarding Morocco’s participation.

Rabat – The minister said that Morocco is an “occupying power” in Western Sahara, corroborating his statement by citing the European Court of Justice, and the High Court of South Africa. The reason for my dismay is that as a Minister and MP, Mr. Landers, the second in command of South African foreign affairs department, most probably knows that it is not up to these courts to decide the status of the Western Sahara territory. A political process has been under way for three decades to monitor the ceasefire, discuss the feasibility of a referendum, discuss new ideas to overcome the stalemate (including autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty), organize family visits, persuade the Algerians and the Polisario to carry out a census of the refugees and apply the Geneva Convention to them etc. This process has been overseen by the UN Security Council, implemented by the UN Secretary General and his personal envoy, with logistical and security help form the MINURSO, and support from the International Community, including the European Union and the African Union. It is this process which is supposed to lead to a mutually acceptable solution and not non-binding court rulings that will decide the fate of the territory and its population. I am equally amazed that the Minister speaks of the conflict but completely ignores the history of the region, and specifically the history of Western Sahara and its relation to Morocco. Had he done his homework, he would have found out that Western Sahara was not only part of Morocco since the tenth Century but was the birthplace of several of its ruling dynasties, among which the Almoravids, the rulers that swept form the dunes of the Sahara all over Northwestern Africa and the Iberian Peninsula in the 11th and the 12th Centuries. Western Sahara tribes have always had allegiance ties with Moroccan Kings, as confirmed by the International Court of Justice advisory ruling of October 16, 1975. If the Honorable MP had taken the time to look at the diplomatic history of the region, he would have understood how European powers negotiated accords with the Moroccan Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries, to protect trade and navigation on the Atlantic, accords which included Western Sahara shores. Even Spain (which later, under Franco, in the late 1960s, claimed that Western Sahara was terra nullis) had, a century before then, asked for “permission” to build a “colony-port” in Western Sahara while negotiating the Tetouan War ceasefire with Morocco in 1861. Had Minister Landers read the modern history of the conflict, he would have learnt that it was Morocco that asked that the territory be added to the agenda of the UN General Assembly as early 1964. By then, Spain had already retroceded the town of Trafaya in 1958 and would do the same with Sidi Ifni in 1969. The process of decolonization had been started by Morocco in the 1950s when its Liberation Army fought the combined French and Spanish forces in the Ecouvillon operation (1958) – a process which was brought to a closure by the signature of the Madrid Accords on November 14, 1975, by virtue of which Western Sahara was retroceded to both Morocco and Mauritania. Morocco is a decolonizing and liberating force in Western Sahara, as it was a financial and logistical source of support for the ANC struggle against Apartheid-a support that was later recognized with dignity by the brave and visionary leader Nelson Mandela. The deliberate negation of history by the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation is compounded by a desire on the part of South African Foreign Affairs Ministry leaders to desperately disrupt the UN process: by advocating for decisions that are still being discussed by the parties under the auspices of the UN SG Personal Envoy to Western Sahara, Horst Koehler. The desperate drive to torpedo the UN-sponsored political process became clear when South African Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Lindiwe Sisulu, decided to hold in Pretoria an alleged solidarity meeting with the Polisario on March 25-65, 2019, to which SADC representatives have been invited. Not only is this meeting not in tune with the African Union Nouakchott Summit resolution in July 2018 whereby the AU supported the UN process, but is out of league with African leaders’ commitment to adopt consensual and unifying positions with regard to African conflicts and crises. The 25-26 March meeting will only usher in another obstacle in the path of African Countries’ attempt to deal in one voice with issues that hinder the growth and emergence of Africa. In addition to that, it looks from the announcement that the meeting is biased and not neutral when it intends to discuss issues that are being negotiated by the parties, as if they had already been decided in favor of Algeria and the Polisario. This is not only divisive but not constructive at all: it would just sow the seeds of dispersion and dissent within a continent that is looking hard for ways to unify everyone behind common causes and find collective solutions to continental problems. The great Nelson Mandela once said: “I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent. I dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all our great wildernesses.” It is incumbent upon all of us Africans, leaders and peoples, not to sow the seeds of divisiveness, but to help realize the vision of the great African leader that was Mandela. This is how History will remember us: as unifiers and as builders of a prosperous future for every African, for all Africans.

Rabat – Africa is the primary beneficiary of Moroccan direct investments, thanks to the development of partnerships and the royal interest in the continent’s development, said Moroccan Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy. In an interview with Maghreb Press Agency (MAP), Elalamy stated that Morocco invested MAD 37 million in Africa from 2013 to 2017, thanks to partnerships and the organization of the national economy towards South-South cooperation, in accordance with King Mohammed VI’s will. He stressed that Morocco is now one of the top African investors of the Economic Community of West African States and the Economic Community of Central African States. Elalamy added that the notable growth of Moroccan investments in Africa in the last decade is due to Morocco’s strong commitment to developing the continent. He noted that the King carried out 50 royal visits to more than 30 countries since 2000 and signed more than 1,000 agreements. Morocco has invested in the sectors of fertilizers, cement, agro-food, and pharmaceuticals. Morocco is also heavily present in banking—with 30 banks operating in Africa, telecommunications, and construction and public works.  “India can use Morocco’s [established] platform … to promote its investment volume in Africa,” pointed out Elalamy, speaking from a conference in India. Elalamy is taking part in the 14th CCI-Exim Bank Conclave in India, along with a Moroccan delegation. India’s presence in Morocco In an interview with Morocco World News, Moulay Hafid Elalamy said that “Morocco’s presence in the Africa-India conference is extremely important with meetings with leading Indian operators with high investment prospects.” “Morocco is now a real platform at the African level, having free trade agreements with 60 countries, making Morocco a real production and export platform,” he highlighted. The minister also spoke of Morocco’s long-standing business relationship with India. “Our Indian friends have joined other American, Chinese, and European investors already established in Morocco,” he said. He added, “Some Indian companies are well established in Morocco. They know very well how our country works and they aspire to strongly develop their activities further.” The minister evoked the lengthy presence of the Indian group, Tata, in Morocco and the inauguration of the first plant by India’s Varroc group in the Tangier free zone on February 26. Elalamy said, “The Varroc group is of Indian origin in terms of capital and is active in the automotive sector and manufactures lighting.” The minister appeared optimistic overall about the Indian-Moroccan partnership’s future, saying, “We have many things to do together and I think the future will bring us more important partnerships than we have had in the past.”

Rabat – Fadil, who was ready to testify in a “bunga bunga” bribery case, fell ill at the end of January and died on March 1. Postmortem tests on Fadil’s blood revealed a high concentration of cadmium and antimony, suggesting that she did not die of natural causes,  Greco said on Monday, March 18. Partial results also showed that Fadil had radioactive elements in her body. The model’s “antimony levels were almost three times normal and the cadmium was almost seven times higher than the normal range,” Greco told Italian news agency, ANSA. He added that prosecutors are still awaiting “definitive autopsy results.” Cadmium is a hazardous heavy metal frequently used in industrial activities. It can be used in the production of alloys, pigments, and batteries. Eating or drinking water with high levels of cadmium or breathing air with very high levels of the metal element can severely damage the lungs and cause death. Swallowing small amounts of cadmium can cause vomiting, diarrhea, joint pains, and even organ failure. Before her death, Fadil said that she had been poisoned and felt strange in her system. She was admitted to a hospital in February.  Fadil’s brother and lawyer later revealed that she died “after a month of agony.” Fadil was due to testify in a case against former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at his “bunga-bunga trial” also known as the “Ruby affair.”  Italian courts had charged Berlusconi with having paid for sex with an underage Moroccan exotic dancer and sex worker, Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, between February and May 2010. He was eventually found not guilty after judges ruled that he could not have known her real age. In January 2017, an Italian court ordered Berlusconi to stand trial on charges of bribing witnesses with $11 million to silence them. He was convicted, sentenced to seven years in prison, and banned from holding elected office. An appeals court overturned  Berlusconi’s conviction in 2014, making him eligible again to hold elected office. Reacting to Fadil’s statements about being poisoned, Berlusconi told the BBC: “It’s always a pity when a young person dies. I never met this person, never talked to her….What I read of her statements made me think that everything was invented, absurd.” Berlusconi is still facing several charges including bribery.

Rabat – The EU headquarters in Brussels is on high alert after an office connected to the EU received a bomb threat, according to the Brussels Times. Approximately 40 people evacuated a building near the European Union headquarters on Tuesday. The consulting office, which does work for the European Commission, received a telephone bomb threat, leading to the immediate evacuation of the building, said Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere. Police closed off a part of the street and deployed sniffer dogs around 11:00 a.m. GMT. Police told the Associated Press (AP) said that they have already reopened the street close to the European Union headquarters. On Monday, a shooting took place in a tram in Utrecht, the Netherlands, leaving three dead. The shooter, identified as Gokmen Tanis, a 37-year-old born in Turkey, was on the run for several hours but was arrested on the same day. Last Friday, 50 were killed and at least 50 more people were wounded in a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Last Saturday, one day after the attack, prosecutors in Christchurch charged Australian national Brenton Tarrant, 28, identified as the main mosque shooter, with murder. He will receive additional charges, said the court.

Rabat – Morocco’s former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane defended the use of the Arabic language in education at the National Conference on the Arabic Language on March 15 at the National Library (BNRM) in Rabat. “There is no evidence that teaching science in Arabic has caused the failure of the education system,” he said. The Moroccan Conference of University Presidents (CPU) made a unanimous recommendation of “teaching scientific subjects in French at all levels of education and training” in a statement on March 6, until the “conditions necessary for teaching these subjects also in English” are met. Benkirane also preferred English as a language to teach science over French. “If [higher] education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French,” he said. Since independence, Moroccan schools have used standard Arabic as the language of instruction in public primary and secondary schools. In universities, some courses are in Arabic, but scientific subjects are taught in French. Teaching science in French before college, Benkirane said, could increase the rates at which students fail and have to retake years of high school. Benkirane also stated that instruction in the Arabic language was a goal in its own right. “The same people who supported teaching in Moroccan Arabic” he said, are behind the call to use more French in education. The debate about language in education sparked after Parliament drafted Law 51-17, still under discussion by the House of Representatives’ Education, Culture, and Communication Committee.  The bill provides for “imposing fees for enrollment in institutions of higher [and] secondary education institutions” and “institutionalizing teaching scientific and technical subjects in foreign languages.” Last week, the National Coordinating Committee for Medical Students in Morocco and the National Coordinating Committee for Engineering Students launched a petition, collecting student signatures opposing Law 51-17. In a press release, the committees called it a “neo-colonialist” bill that would pave the way for education “privatization.” French speakers have increased in recent years, “particularly in Africa,” reported French newspaper Le Monde on March 16. French added nearly 23 million speakers since 2014, or 10 percent in four years.  In addition to the ongoing conversation about the languages of teaching, teachers and the government are having another heated debate. Contract teachers plan to continue their latest wave of protests that began early March for better pay.

Rabat – In the wake of a terrorist attack against the Muslim community of Christchurch, New Zealand, that left 50 dead and 50 more injured on Friday, March 15, public figures and communities in Australia are expressing their solidarity for their neighbors. Tuesday evening, March 19, saw gatherings across the nation in support of New Zealand. Hundreds gathered in Canberra, the capital, for an anti-racism rally. One local Muslim advocate, Diana Abdel Rahman, delivered a speech calling for action: “You can no longer stand on the bylines. You must be active. If you see hate, call it out.”  A local teacher, Imad Alsmadi, also took to the microphone to say he was proud to be a Muslim Australian and that he was there “just to send a message to Australian people, to all people … we are against Islamophobia.”  Tuesday evening, Canberrans laid down 50 prayer mats, each with a candle on top, in remembrance of the Christchurch victims. The city’s “peace bell,” also rang 50 times. Attendees prayed in both Maori and English before people stepped up to remember the dead. Sydney and Melbourne also saw similar vigils with hundreds in attendance.  One man, Shamim Homayun, gave an emotional speech saying he had desperately tried to call his friend in Christchurch multiple times before learning he had died in the terrorist attack. He told the audience, “I try to soothe my pain by telling myself that he would have wanted to die in a mosque.”  The capital’s legislative assembly also saw an emotional debate on Tuesday, with the nation’s leaders giving speeches expressing solidarity with the Muslim community. Canberra’s Chief Minister Andrew Barr told the assembly, “We stand with our Muslim community members, we stand with all New Zealanders, no two countries in the world are closer than Australia and New Zealand; they are us.”  The opposition leader, Alistair Coe, praised the Muslim community for the way they responded to the attack with dignity, saying it would have been easy to react with hate, but instead they reacted with love. He said the response was true to the faith’s teachings, as the Qur’an teaches generosity, mercy, forgiveness, love, and truth, which is what the community has shown since the attack. He said just “thinking of the attack and the immense trauma of those affected” gave him chills down his spine. However, one far-right politician was not on the same wavelength. A Queensland senator, Fraser Anning, caused global outrage after he released a statement on Friday seemingly blaming New Zealand’s Muslim community and migration for the attack. An online petition to expel the senator from Parliament has amassed 1.2 million signatures and condemnation from the general public and fellow politicians.  Prime Minister Morrison responded by vehemently condemning the senator’s statements. “The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, right-wing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting. Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.” On Saturday night, the Sydney Opera House projected the silver fern, a symbol of New Zealand, onto the iconic landmark, lighting up its distinctive sails as a symbol of solidarity with New Zealand. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the projection aimed to express “solidarity, support and respect” and show the state’s unity and compassion towards everyone affected by the attacks. Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that New Zealand charged a New South Wales native, 28-year-old Brenton Harrison Tarrant, with murder following the terror attack. However, the historically close relationship between New Zealand and Australia remains as solid as ever. Australia’s religious leaders also came together to promote unity. The Muslim Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohammed and Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher held an interfaith church service on Sunday, March 17, at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney, with several MPs, including Scott Morrison, in attendance. Fisher began the service by saying, “We stand together in our horror at the real evil we have witnessed, at the violence perpetrated and the hate that inspired it.” He also emphasized the importance of compassion, not hatred, during trying times. “To all young people like him we say today: if it is real strength you want, you will find it in compassion and mercy, not hate and violence.” He finished his speech by saying “peace be upon you” in Arabic, then handed over to Mohammed, after kissing him on the cheek three times and shaking his hand.   Mohammed’s speech followed similar themes, emphasizing that the actions of the Australian attacker “should not divide us.” He continued, “Whether you are Muslim or Christian or Jewish or any other faith group, as long as you live in Australia, as long as you are part of this family, nothing will divide us.” Scott Morrison echoed the sentiments in a speech he delivered on Monday to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Victoria, saying he wanted to “remove the demarcation lines between Australians.” He called on Australians to reject a culture of racism and “tribalism.” “If we allow a culture of ‘us and them’, of tribalism, to take hold; if we surrender an individual to be defined not by their own unique worth and contribution but by the tribe they are assigned to; if we yield to the compulsion to pick sides rather than happy coexistence, we will lose what makes diversity work in Australia.” He added that division, contempt, and mindless tribalism “ends in the worst of places. Last week it ended the lives of 50 fellow human beings, including children praying in Christchurch.” He also praised New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for her powerful words just a few hours after the Christchurch attack on Friday, when she said of New Zealand’s Muslim and refugee community, “They are us.” “This is a powerful idea. No them but us … As prime minister, I want to continue to bring Australians together, not set them against one another.”

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested an Italian national suspected of being a leader in the Italian criminal network Camorra on Monday, March 18. Camorra is one of Italy’s oldest and largest criminal syndicates with an active international presence. Police apprehended the 44-year-old in the Ourika region, 30 kilometers from Marrakech. They acted in response to a red notice issued on January 7 by the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) at the request of Italian authorities. Interpol issued the red notice due to the suspect’s alleged involvement in premeditated murder and the possession of unauthorized firearms, said the national police (DGSN) in a statement. According to the DGSN, the suspect was remanded in custody in preparation for extradition. Morocco has already notified Italy of the arrest.  The arrest is part of increased bilateral security cooperation between Morocco and Italy. It also serves as an example of the reinforcement of search mechanisms for individuals wanted by international arrest warrants. In October 2018, the Moroccan minister of justice, Mohamed Aujjar, and the president of the Italian Council of State, Filippo Patroni Griffi, spoke at a conference in Rome about the importance of Morocco and Italy exchanging expertise and information. One of the stated goals of such an exchange was the enforcement of court judgements and arrest warrants made in both countries. Police have previously linked Camorra members to trafficking drugs from Morocco and Spain in addition to money laundering, extortion, and murder.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has again addressed a message to the nation to announce preparations for the National Inclusive Conference, defying Algerians’ demands that he step down from office when his term ends April 28. Hundreds of thousands of Algerians have rallied in Algiers continuously calling for reforms and for the government to refrain from postponing the 2019 election, planned previously for April 18. Protesters made their voices heard worldwide, and President Bouteflika responded to their initial demand that he step out of the presidential race. But he promised to postpone elections instead and create a National Inclusive Conference, which protestors are also rejecting. In his address on Monday, March 18, Bouteflika promised a “change in the country’s governance regime” and to “refresh its political, economic and social systems unter the National Inclusive Conference.” Bouteflika said that the conference would meet in the “very near future,” but has not yet revealed the date. Protestors are concerned he plans to extend his fourth term indefinitely. “The mission of this conference is the more sensitive, as it has the mission to issue crucial decisions, which are likely to make the qualitative leap demanded by our people, notably youth.” He added that the step “will be endorsed by a comprehensive and deep revision of the constitution,” which will establish a “new electoral process, under which a new president will be elected.” The president also called Algerians to “stand beside the Army to protect Algeria from the external dangers, and enjoy peace and stability.”  The army’s top chief, Gaid Salah, said on Monday that everyone should “show responsibility to find solutions as soon as possible.” He added that Algerians are able to “prevent their country from any situation [that could be] exploited by hostile foreign parties.” Algeria’s “pouvoir,” or elites, allegedly believe that the protests could undermine Algeria’s stability and make the country another Syria or Iraq. Quoted by France 24, the former UN envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi denied a direct link between the situation in Algeria and in other countries. “We must be aware of the dangers that exist. Talking about Iraq or Syria is not an attempt to tell the population to hold still … we tell them to go ahead with their eyes open,” he said. The newly appointed prime minister, Noureddine Bedoui, announced that he had begun talks with parties to form a new government. Independent labor unions shared a statement to announce their refusal to participate in a meeting to which the prime minister invited them. The National Union of Public Health Practitioners (SNPSP) said, “We consider that the conditions necessary for the success of such a dialogue have not yet been met.”

Rabat – Police in Utrecht announced the arrest of the suspect of the shooting, which took place in a tram on Monday morning. The attack, which is investigated as a possible act of terror, killed three people and injured five others. Police said they ruled out other reasons  as motive of the attacks.  A source told Morocco World News earlier today that the the gunman opened fire over “family reasons.” Anadolu Agency quoted relatives of  the gunman, who said that he fired at his relative for “family reasons.” The gunman identified as Turkish-born Gokmen Tanis, 37, reportedly shot at others who attempted to help the relative.

The Moroccan embassy in  The Hague announced Monday that it was following the situation with Dutch authorities to see if there are any Moroccans among the victims of the Utrecht tram attack. De politie heeft aan het begin van de avond een man aangehouden op verdenking van betrokkenheid bij het schietincident vanmorgen aan het 24 oktoberplein in Utrecht. Het onderzoek is nog in volle gang.

Washington D.C. – While watching news coverage of the accident, I could not help but to think of Lion Air crash in October 2018 off the Java Sea. You do not need to be an aerospace engineer to see the similarities between the two events. New airplanes with “sophisticated” software do not fall off the sky unless there is a flaw in their design or a bug in their computer systems. Clearly, the Boeing 737 MAX has serious problems and it should not be in the air shuttling passengers around the globe. As investigators determine if the Boeing 737 MAX’s flight control system caused the deadly accidents, RAM faces a special challenge since most of its fleet is Boeing. However, early reports of lapses in the safety approval system and lack of proper training materials for this specific aircraft are worrisome and question Boeing’s commitment to safety. As a result, airlines worldwide need to revisit their relationship with the Seattle based company. Indeed, news reports circulating in the American media should raise alarm among RAM executives. According to the Wall Street Journal, The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) launched an inquiry after Indonesia’s Lion Air crashed back in October, few months before the Ethiopia accident. DOT is probing if Boeing failed to warn airlines about a potentially dangerous feature in its flight control system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) on the MAX. Furthermore, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the United States government agency that regulates civil aviation, employees warned as early as seven years ago that Boeing had too much control over the Federal authorization process of new aircrafts. Since the FAA started to shift more authority to the manufacturer itself, Federal regulators lost control over the certification process leading to the potential approval of airplanes that should not be flying. But it is Dominic Gates’, Seattle Times aerospace reporter, story exposing a possible collusion between FAA mangers and Boeing that should put RAM’s officials on notice. According to the Seattle Times,” Boeing hustled in 2015 to catch up to Airbus and certify its new 737 MAX, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) managers pushed the agency’s safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing itself, and to speedily approve the resulting analysis.” Additionally, “several FAA technical experts said in interviews that as certification proceeded, managers prodded them to speed the process. Development of the MAX was lagging nine months behind the rival Airbus A320neo. “ According to the Seattle Times” the original safety analysis that Boeing delivered to the FAA for a new flight control system on the MAX — a report used to certify the plane as safe to fly — had several crucial flaws. In interview with National Public Radio, Mr. Gates confirmed that both  “Boeing and the FAA were informed of the specifics of this story and were asked for responses 11 days ago before the second crash of a 737 MAX.” This chummy relationship between federal regulators and the industry they are supposed to regulate explains why after the two fatal crashes, the FAA and Boeing ignored the similarities between the incidents and insisted on the airworthiness of the MAX. Since it is becoming evident that the FAA is out of step with International aviation safety organizations and that Boeing cannot be trusted to self-certify, RAM should be more vigilant when buying Boeing aircrafts. With the 737 MAX grounded, it is time for the Moroccan airlines to re-work its commitment to Boeing.

Rabat – Using an Arabic proverb, Avichay Adraee, a lieutenant colonel in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), pointed out that even a media outlet from a Muslim country, Moroccan outlet Medi1 “acknowledged” that a Palestinian killing an Israeli soldier is an act of “terrorism.” On Sunday, March 17, Medi1, a private commercial Moroccan radio network with an audience of about 23 million people published a news article titled “Palestinian Kills Israeli Soldier in ‘Terror’ Attack.” Adrae, the spokesperson of the IDF, wrote on his Facebook account on Monday an Arabic expression used to show an ironic situation—originally mentioned in the Qu’ranic surah Yusuf—that translates to “A witness from the family testified.” The Israeli spokesperson, who posted a screenshot of Medi1’s post, warned: “This is a cowardly terrorist operation whose perpetrator is a despicable terrorist we will hold accountable sooner or later.”  In the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pro-Palestinians fear the “normalization” of relations between Israel and Arab countries amid the oppression of the Palestinian people. The Moroccan Anti-Normalization Center expressed anger at Medi1 and condemned the way it described the “Palestinian resistance” as a “terror” attack. The center wrote on Monday on its official Facebook page: “Congratulations to Medi1 for earning the Zionist medallion given to it by the spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces Avichay Adrea. This is disgraceful journalism.”  The page also posted a screenshot of Medi1’s post with the hashtag: “Normalization_treason.” In a statement, the anti-normalization center stressed that the Moroccan High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) should inspect Medi1’s report. The center said the government should address any hint of “Zionist” propaganda published in the media. In a shooting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a Palestinian killed an Israeli soldier, 19. Another was seriously injured. Palestinian media reported that the Israeli military raided an area near Burqin, a West Bank Palestinian village, in search of the shooter. Security forces are pursuing the Palestinian shooter, who is still on the run. The anti-normalization center has addressed other instances of appearances of thawing in Israel-Morocco relations, including an educational children’s book published in Morocco that negated the existence of Palestine and described Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In January, the Ministry of Education denied that the book was “a schoolbook” published under its watch. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has persisted since the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948. On December 6, 2017, US President Donald Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Arab leaders, including King Mohammed VI, King Abdullah of Jordan, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, condemned the move.

Rabat – At a time when Africa is increasingly under the spotlight, India is eager to join the cohort of technologically-savvy countries hoping to reap the benefits of Africa’s enormous investment opportunities. From March 17-19, delegations from 21 African countries convened in New Delhi, India, to celebrate growing Indo-African ties at the 14th CII-Exim Bank Conclave on India. Under the theme “India and Africa: Shaping a Global Partnership for a Better World,” the event seeks to lay the ground for more Indo-African cooperation, enabling Indian industry to “play a bigger part in Africa’s manufacture renaissance.” Among the African delegates present at the conclave, there appeared to be resounding agreement on the need to channel India’s comparative advantages in the automotive, solar energy, aeronautics, and banking sectors. The hope is to stimulate inclusive growth, meet the requirements of sustainable development, and “increase the added value” of individual African countries, according to Morocco’s investment and industry minister Moulay Hafid Elalamy, who led the Moroccan delegation. In an interview with Morocco World News after his speech at the opening ceremony of the conclave, Elalamy stressed the necessity of facilitating dialogue and cooperation between Indian and African private sectors to drive investments up and achieve the expertise level required to rise up to development challenges continentally and nationally. But the event also follows in the footsteps of the October 2015 India-Africa Forum, when India laid the groundwork for its African foreign policy, setting out to consolidate its presence in African trade, manufacture, diplomatic, and financial ecosystems. Speaking in the opening ceremony of the CII-Exim Bank Conclave, India’s commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu emphasized Africa’s importance in terms of investment opportunities for Indian public and private sectors. Prabhu suggested that the Indo-African platform’s main goal is to consolidate the new India-Africa impetus by basing it on historic socio-political and historical closeness. The Indian minister’s allusion, as other African and Indian delegates went on to argue on the opening day of the conclave, is to the fundamental role India played as both a trade partner and a provider of human resource trainers in the first years of African decolonization. In the new configuration of Indo-African relations, New Delhi seeks to put economic diplomacy at the forefront of the framework for the shared future between African and Indian change makers. As India increasingly focuses its gaze on Africa, Morocco is the necessary link between India and Africa, according to Morocco’s Elalamy. Morocco, whose financial, banking, and industrial giants are making significant forays in the African geopolitical landscape, has been recently touted as an indispensable player in the emerging African order. But more than a player confined to the riches of African markets, Rabat seeks to capitalize its growing African assertiveness to lay the foundations of its aspirations on the world stage. In his speech at the conclave, Elalamy made abundant mention of Morocco’s efforts in industrial ventures. From the aeronautics to automotive sectors, Rabat is rejuvenating its industrial sector to be a “true production and exportation platform,” in addition to the “African investment hub” it already is. With “well trained people,” Elalamy insisted, Morocco and the rest of Africa are showing their eagerness to be part of global dialogues on development. Not content with being mere markets for giants like the EU, China, and India, the continent wants to position itself as a producer. For Elalamy, the challenge lies in having as many trade partners as possible to build the bases of a future where the continent will itself produce the majority of what it consumes or needs. “We can do more in Africa if we open our ecosystems to multiple countries … to increase our added value.” Elalamy’s points read like a textbook summary of Morocco’s trade and diplomatic approach in recent years. Capitalizing on its “strategic location as a bridge between different political cultures and civilizations,” Morocco has increasingly opted for a policy of outreach, partnering with any country that can help it attain its “strategic goals.” The vision is one of “multifaceted and pragmatic” foreign policy based on multiplying partnerships to materialize different ambitions, from the Green Morocco Plan to the Industrial Acceleration Plan. As far as Morocco is concerned, the answer to global crises and individual national challenges resides in the practice of diplomatic versatility. But while the approach prioritizes dialogue and soft diplomacy and is commended in many policy circles, it is far from being a bed of roses. In the India-Africa context, one challenge to Morocco’s versatile diplomacy is the subtle—but increasingly overt—rivalry between India and China. “If it weren’t for China, Africa’s largest trading partner would be India,” one observer remarked in August last year as China prepared to host its now famous China-Africa summit. For both Asian countries, the article argued, “Africa can no longer be viewed as an intermittent and peripheral interest.” Rather, with its numerous resources and green investment pastures, the continent is now part of the global scramble for geostrategic dominance. The question, for a country like Morocco, also a front-bench partner in China’s “the Belt and Road Initiative,” resides in finding a balance between two partners with competing interests. Speaking to Morocco World News, Elalamy suggested that such binary conceptions do no good for multilateral cooperation. In his reckoning, Morocco is open to any partnerships that have the potential of propelling it towards sustainable and inclusive development. “Morocco has free trade agreement with as many as sixty countries. This has allowed us to position ourselves as an indispensable African platform for investments, production, and exportation opportunities,” he told MWN. He then explained that the conclave is particularly important because “we met with high caliber Indian investors and business owners to discuss investment possibilities in Morocco.” The Moroccan minister did not overtly state what Morocco wants from its perceived trade versatility. He did not have to. But based on Morocco’s increased engagement on multiple fronts, it is obvious the North African country is navigating the complex African and global waters to assert itself as an indispensable guest at the world table.

Rabat – Amnesty International has said the terror attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, are “a devastating reminder of the consequences of letting hatred and demonization go unchecked.” The organization’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo condemned the terrorist attack on Friday, March 15. “This is also a moment of reckoning for leaders across the world who have encouraged or turned a blind eye to the scourge of Islamophobia,” Naidoo said. He added, “The politics of demonization has today cost 49 people their lives. Reports that the attackers followed a white supremacist manifesto must galvanize world leaders to start standing against this hate-filled ideology.” He further stated, “The New Zealand we believe in is one that thrives as a multicultural society, welcomes refugees and migrants, and respects the rights of everyone to practice their religion in peace.” For Naidoo, the tragedy is only a trigger to stand against Islamophobia and create “a society built around peace, hope, and justice.”

Rabat – A 29-year-old Polisario officer has arrived at the Moroccan defense line, announcing his intention to return to Morocco from Algeria, military sources told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). MAP described the young officer as a rebel from the Polisario military, who claimed to be a captain serving as the deputy officer of the “Katiba battalion” of the front’s self-styled gendarmerie. The rebel, who was driving a Jeep, introduced himself to the Moroccan army  Monday morning at the Moroccan defense line in the Farcia area of the Oued Draa region. The officer declared his intention to return to Morocco, according to the military sources. The officer said that there are other Polisario members who also want to return to Morocco. Several former Polisario members have returned to Morocco from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, including Yenja Khattat, now president of the Dakhla region, and one of the founders of the Polisario Front, El Bachir Dkhil. Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps decided to take a stand against allegedly unbearable living conditions  by protesting in the camps and internationally. Several Moroccan and international observers have been calling on the Polisario Front to accept Morocco’s autonomy plan as a credible and serious solution to end the conflict over the region. One of the observers was pro-Polisario analyst Ricardo Sanchez Serra, who spoke about the “human tragedy” Sahrawis are living in the camps. “Perhaps I am more ‘dissident’ than all the founding members of the Polisario who have decided to break at different times of the conflict and return to Morocco, where many have managed to integrate successfully in the political and social life of the country,” wrote Serra. The analyst, who also founded the Peruvian Council of Friendship with the Sahrawi People, also described the Tindouf camps as a “real time bomb.”Serra said that 10,000 Sahrawis have fled throughout the 44 years of the conflict.  He said that they have not fled the camps through “comfortable airports, but they risked their lives in an arid and mined desert. God knows how many will have lost their lives.”

Rabat – The Ethiopian transport minister, Dagmawit Moges, said on Sunday, March 17, that investigators have recovered all relevant data from the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 black boxes.  According to Moges, a preliminary analysis of the data found that there were “clear similarities” with the Lion Air Flight 610 which crashed in Indonesia last October. Journalists repeatedly questioned the minister, but she did not specify what the exact similarities between the crashes were. Moges simply said that the flights would be “subject to further investigation” and a report on the crash will be published in 30 days. The Ethiopian Airlines crash is the second accident involving a Boeing 737 MAX 8 in less than six months. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 went down over the Java Sea just 13 minutes after take-off. All 189 people on board died. While Boeing officials said that they continue to have “full confidence” in the safety of their planes, the company still recommended that the global fleet of 737 MAXes be grounded until the investigation is complete.  Morocco was one of the first countries to ground its 737 MAX 8s in the day following the crash in Ethiopia on March 10. Other countries and airlines then followed suit. In both flights, pilots experienced erratic altitude changes and reported flight control problems just before crashing. Investigators of the Lion Air crash suspect that an attack sensor transmitted incorrect data to the plane, triggering automated flight software called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). MCAS likely forced the nose of the plane down, explaining why data from the crash reports that the pilots manually corrected an “automatic aircraft nose down” a number of times before the plane crashed into the sea. A Seattle Times report published on Sunday found that the safety analysis Boeing gave to the US Federal Aviation Administration regarding the MCAS system has “several crucial flaws.” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg issued a statement that the company’s top priority is safety and thus will be “finalizing its development of a previously-announced software update and pilot training revision that will address the MCAS flight control law’s behavior in response to erroneous sensor inputs.”

Rabat – Dutch political parties have suspended campaigns for the Provincial Council elections in Limburg soon after a shooting occurred in Utrecht on Monday, March 18, according to Dutch outlet 1Limburg. Limburg province is home to four municipalities in the top ten of “least safe” in the Netherlands, Dutch outlet NL Times reported in early March. The Dutch provincial council members are elected directly every four years. Another rally came to an end because of the attack. A pension protest at Park Malieveld in the Hague ended at noon because of the Utrecht shooting, Police Union (ACP) chairman Gerrit van de Kamp told 1Limburg.  The Utrecht shooting took place in the Kanaleneiland neighborhood, home to a large Moroccan and Turkish community. The police said they were looking for a Turkish-born man named Gokmen Tanis, 37, “linked to the incident.” In an unprecedented case, the threat level in the province of Utrecht has been scaled up to the highest level. The Utrecht attack has “all the characteristics” of a terrorist act, according to the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV).  A man opened fire in a tram in Utrecht Monday morning, killing three and injuring nine. The gunman fled the crime scene by car. Police cited a “possible terrorist move.” Moroccan-Dutch people have been on alert recently. Last week, nearly 100 teenagers shouting the name of Dutch far-right politician, Geert Wilders, broke into a Moroccan family’s town house in the Dutch town of Urk. They hit the mother and injured the daughter. Locals said the attackers were looking for the son who had “offended” a neighbor’s girlfriend.

Rabat – In the wake of a terrorist attack on two New Zealand mosques on March 15, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced the government will give AUD 55 million (US $39 million) in grants to step up security measures at mosques, synagogues, churches, temples, and religious schools.  The funds would help end what Morrison called “mindless tribalism.”   He tweeted, “We’ll deliver $55 million for grants that will prioritise safety enhancements at religious schools and places of worship, such as CCTV cameras, lighting, fencing, bollards, alarms, and security systems.” The grants are part of the Australian government’s Safer Communities Fund project for communities at risk of extremism and terror. Morrison highlighted the importance of freedom of religion. “Religious freedom is not just an inalienable right as free citizens. It is import to the very cohesion of our society. It is for many Australians impossible to separate their faith from their culture.”  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wore a hijab to express solidarity with to the bereaved families as she took the lead in signing a book of condolence for the victims of the Christchurch attack. As the world is decrying the horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by an Australian right-wing terrorist, the Casablanca Wydad football club recited the first surah of the Qur’an in grief over the victims.

Rabat – The head of the Union of Muslim scholars, Ahmed Al Raissouni, has said that Western countries bear responsibility for the New Zealand terrorist attack on two mosques. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the Moroccan scholar condemned the attack which killed 50 worshippers. The scholar added that Muslims face hostility in campaigns against Muslims and Islam. “The movements behind [campaigns against Muslims] work in broad daylight,” Raissouni argued. The scholar said that hostility against Muslims has moved beyond movements to national policies, which have put restrictions on Muslims. Al Raissouni pointed out that France has closed a number of mosques and prevented others from opening across the country. Reports of the French closures of several mosques spread widely on social media in February. Al Bawaba reported that the French government closed seven mosques within one year, which led to harsh criticism from Muslims in France. According to Al Raissouni, such decisions create extremists. According to the scholar, some parties are “taking advantage of terror incidents committed by some Muslims to justify incitement against Muslim communities.” Al Raissouni also commented on the lengthy manifesto published by the Australian terrorist who attacked the New Zealand mosques to justify his crime. Read Also: Wydad Casablanca Fans Pay Tribute to Victims of New Zealand Terror Attack Raissouni implied that the manifesto was an attempt to invoke “Crusade-era symbols.” He added that Muslims’ ability to integrate well into multiple countries is disturbing the extremists who want to “isolate” Muslims everywhere. In the 74-manifesto, the terrorist cited Eurocentric sentiments as his motive. The attacker expressed anti-immigrant views, implying that migrants with higher birth rates are displacing European populations. In response to the attack, Al Raissouni urged for dialogue and “counter incitement” to “pressure parties that nurture extremism … to stop this hostile attitude against Muslims.” World leaders condemned the attacks, which killed 50 and injured at least 50 more people. King Mohammed VI emphasized that the attacks are a “flagrant violation of the sacredness of places of worship and the universal human values of coexistence, tolerance, and fraterbutt.”

Rabat – Police in Utrecht, the Netherlands, are still looking for a man who opened fire in a tram on Monday morning. Police have issued several statements on the situation, urging people to stay inside. The country’s police also temporarily raised the Netherlands’ threat level to the highest level. In a tweet, police said they are not ruling out other attacks because the attacker is still on the run. Police also called on people to report any “suspicious situation to the police via 112.” Police are advising people in Utrecht “not to go to the Kanaleneiland area.” The tram’s surveillance video caught images of the shooter. Police identified the attacker as a 37-year-old  Turkish-born man, named Gokman Tanis. De politie bevestigt dat het beeld op dit moment is dat er sprake is van 3 doden en 9 gewonden. #24oktoberplein #utrecht

Rabat – Customs officers at Schoenefeld Airport in Berlin have caught a German man smuggling three living Moroccan tortoises inside a pastry box. The officers confiscated the animals and placed them in veterinary care in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The tortoises are protected under the multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals. If charged with breaking international species protection law, the 69-year-old man risks a fine of up to €50,000 and up to five years in jail, according to a statement released by Schoenefeld Airport last week. Recently, the Spanish civil guard arrested a woman from Equatorial Guinea arriving in Spain from Morocco with five dead animals in her suitcase, four porcupines and one pangolin. The woman hid the animals in her luggage without any documentation. The pangolin, the world’s most trafficked animal, is critically endangered and is listed under CITES. The Spanish police found the animals while screening the luggage of passengers on a flight from Casablanca.

Rabat – A 17-year-old Australian boy who cracked a raw egg on the head of Australian Senator Fraser Anning has said that he will donate most of the money others raised for him to the victims of a right-wing terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Anning, who blamed the terror attacks on Muslim immigrants, responded to the egging by slapping the teen, Will Connolly. Connolly had recorded the whole scene on camera before security tackled him. Police arrested Connolly but later released him without charges. A fan of the “egg boy” started a GoFundMe page and raised $49,955 for Connolly’s legal fees. The egg boy fan said Connolly told him that “he is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attacks.” After being released, Connolly tweeted that he was proud of himself for egging the senator. This was the moment when I felt so proud to exist as a human being.
Let me inform you all guys.Muslims are not terrorists and terrorism has no religion. All those who consider Muslims a terrorist community, have empty heads like Anning.#eggboy #eggAnning pic.twitter.com/7HUg6EXBPG — Will Connolly AU (@Willl_Connolly) March 17, 2019 
The video of the egging was widely spread on the internet. Connolly made the move during a news conference in Melbourne on Saturday, following his tweet that said, “Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?”

Rabat- “If you truly care about Yemeni lives, you’d support the Saudi-led effort to prevent Yemen from turning into a puppet state,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a press conference on March 15. He pledged the Trump administration’s continued support for the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. His statements chided US senators for their March 13 vote to cut off US military support to the Saudis—a blow to the Trump administration, which has stood by Riyadh. The US House of Representatives has not yet voted on the resolution, but its message was clear: Congressional support for Trump’s Yemen policy is waning. Since Saudi Arabia launched their military campaign in Yemen in 2015 with a coalition of nine other nations, including Morocco, the conflict has spiraled into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Famine, airstrikes, and fighting have taken tens of thousands of civilian lives, according to UN sources. While Morocco’s involvement in the coalition had decreased, foreign minister Nasser Bourita seemed to imply Morocco was withdrawing from the coalition entirely in February, to the delight of Houthi opposition forces. But the US remains a major ally for the Saudis in the conflict, providing arms, aircraft support, and training services to their military. US politicians, though, have felt empowered to push the Trump administration on the issue in recent months after Saudi agents’ horrific murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi spurred global condemnation and scrutiny. “Today is a day that we can make a clear and unequivocal statement that we do not support this continuing conflict and humanitarian disaster,” said US Senator Bob Menendez on March 13, in support of the resolution. “There is a consequence for acting in the way that the coalition has done.” At Friday’s press conference, Pompeo insisted that the administration wanted solutions for Yemen’s humanitarian crisis. “We all want this conflict to end,” he said. But severing US military assistance to the coalition was not the solution, he explained, stressing the dangers that “corrupt, brutish” Iran, which allegedly backs the Houthi rebels, posed for the region. Morocco did not disclose the full reasoning behind its changing status in the Yemen coalition. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita cited only “political and humanitarian developments on the ground.” The decision heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia and Morocco, although the two countries have since made efforts to reaffirm their diplomatic ties. Despite the opposition, US funding for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen will likely continue, at least for the near future, as Trump has threatened to veto the resolution once it arrives at his desk.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has reiterated that the government will maintain its “non-interference” in massive demonstrations in Algeria. Bourita said that Morocco will “neither meddle with the internal developments that Algeria witnesses nor comment on them,” according to AFP. Morocco’s policy counts on strengthening win-win diplomatic cooperation through respect for states’ sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs. Protests continue in Algeria, despite Bouteflika’s decision to withdraw his bid for a fifth term. In the last week, protestors have railed against Bouteflika’s decision to postpone the 2019 election. The Moroccan-Algerian diplomatic ties have long been tense because of opposing stances on the Western Sahara conflict and Morocco’s territorial integrity. The border between the two countries has also been closed since 1994. Algeria made the decision after Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terror attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Tensions flamed when Algeria started supporting the separatist group of the Polisario Front. It remains to be seen whether the current “hirak,” or popular movement, in Algeria will change its stance on the conflict. Morocco, at the initiative of King Mohammed VI, invited Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue to end the stalemate that hampers the Maghreb unity project. Algeria has not given any direct response to King Mohammed VI’s initiative.  Algeria’s newly appointed prime minister, Noureddine Bedoui, announced the beginning of talks to form a new government after Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia resigned last week. Algerian protesters, however, appear to reject the formation of the new government because they are calling for a “big clean up” of the Algerian regime. Opposition parties also called on Algeria’s ruling authority to step down. The head of the opposition Islamist Movement for the Society of Peace, Abderrazak Makri, said, “The gang has refused to respond to the Algerian people until today and this moment. It has to listen to the voice of the street and implement what it wants.”

Rabat – The man who carried out a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, March 15, posted a 74-page manifesto online the same day citing Eurocentric sentiments as his motive. The attacker, Brenton Tarrant, killed 50 people. The document, titled “The Great Replacement,” laid out the shooter’s desire to attack Muslims.  The title references a theory that migrants with higher birth rates are displacing European populations. The terrorist lists Donald Trump, Candace Owens, a video game commentator, and Anders Breivik as his inspirations. The attacker said he supported Trump merely “as a symbol of white identity” not as a “policy maker and leader.” The manifesto “above all” credits pro-Trump African-American commentator Candace Owens as an inspiration.  In the manifesto, the terrorist identified himself as an Australian-born, 28-year-old white man from a working-class family. In a Facebook live-stream, the terrorist videoed himself carrying out the attack and recommended “PewDiePie,” a YouTube channel by Felix Kjellberg, a video game commentator. Before he started shooting, the attacker told his viewers to “subscribe to PewDiePie.” Kjellberg, whose channel name reflects the sound of a bullet and death, is particularly known for making “edgy jokes [that] normalise racism,” according to the Independent. The shooter also explained that he was inspired by Anders Breivik, saying he was a main catalyst for the terror attack. The far-right terrorist shot 77 people dead in Norway in 2011.  Aside from extremist views, both attackers shared some commonalities in having their parents divorce and receiving extensive physical training. According to the manifesto, two events in France and Sweden radicalized the Australian. One was the 2017 electoral loss of French right-wing leader Marine Le Pen in France. The second was the death of Ebba Akerlund, 11, in a vehicle-ramming attack in Sweden the same year.  By 2018, the attacker had visited Turkey, parts of Eastern Europe, and the Balkans, ending a series of travels that started shortly after his father’s death. In the Facebook live video of the Christchurch massacre, the attacker played a song that glorifies Radovan Karadzic, a Bosnian Serb former politician who will be in court this week in a final appeal, facing jail time over war crimes at Srebrenica. According to the manifesto, the terror attack was an instrument to “divide … Europeans and the invaders currently occupying European soil.” The document starts with “Do not go gentle into that good night,” from a poem by the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, and goes on in length about race and birth rates. In the introduction, the text reads: “It’s the birthrates [sic]” and “If there is one thing I want you to remember from these writings, [it’s] that the [birth rates] must change.” The attacker concludes the introduction by saying the high fertility rate among migrants will result in “white genocide.” For another 69 pages, the manifesto continues under the title “Answering possible questions.” The attacker raises and answers many questions about himself. He also inserted links to Wikipedia articles as “arguments” supporting his views on migration and birth rates.  In the “conclusion,” the attacker returned again to “birth rates” as a resolution for the “conflict.” He concluded with a poem about overcoming hardships, written by the 19th-century English poet William Ernest Henley while in a hospital. Titled, “Invictus,” Latin for “undefeated,” the poem ends with the famous lines: “I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.” The attacker signed off with, “Goodbye, god bless you all and I will see you in Valhalla. EUROPA RISES.” In northern European mythology,  “Valhalla” refers to the “hall of the slain,” where those who have died in combat go in the afterlife. Coincidently, the week of the attack, American political commentator Tucker Carlson came under fire for attacking Muslims and other minorities, after Media Matters published transcripts from his appearances on radio from 2006 to 2011. “I’m going to kill as many [Muslims] as I can if you elect me,” he imagined his ideal president as saying, in one transcript.  In 2018, Carlson criticized President Trump for failing to achieve his electoral promises. Then, American online outlet the Daily Beast said Carlson uses “the rhetoric of… ‘white genocide,’” which equates immigrants to “invaders.” Following the Christchurch attack, one former hate group member told CNN about what he thought “motivated” the massacre. “Fear,” said Frank Meeink. The attacker thought he was a “warrior,” Meeink added.  When asked if he thought a change of mind was possible, Meeink said “Anyone can change their mind.” He noted that he could not watch the video of the attack because he had “empathy” for the Muslim people in his life.

Rabat- “On behalf of all New Zealanders, we grieve together. We are one. They are us,” Jacinda Ardern wrote in a national condolence book for Muslims killed in the terror attack on two Christchurch mosques last Friday, March 15. Ardern was the first to sign the condolence book. On Saturday, March 16, Ardern visited Canterbury Refugee Centre in Christchurch and met the grieving families of the victims, promising to ensure their safety in New Zealand. She also promised to hasten the returning of their deceased loved ones’ bodies to them so they can properly mourn and perform religious burial rites. Muslim families bathe and shroud the bodies of their loved ones and perform prayers. Muslims usually bury their relatives within 24 hours. In the case of the mosque attack victims, their bodies will not be returned until post mortem examinations are carried out. Many New Zealanders showed solidarity with the victims’ relatives, visiting mosques, mourning, and placing flowers on memorials.  In Morocco, the Wydad Casablanca (WAC) football club at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, recited Al Fatiha, the opening surah of the Qur’an, to express support for the families of the victims. The heinous attacks led people to call for a tightening of gun laws, particularly to add more restrictions to the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used by the main shooter. Arden told TVNZ, a New Zealand television channel, on Monday: “What the public rightly are asking right now is why is it and how is it that you are currently able to buy military style semi-automatic weapons in New Zealand, and that’s the right question to ask.” “There are ways we can bring in effective regulation of firearms that actually target those we need to target, and that is our focus,” she said. Last Saturday, one day after the attack, prosecutors in Christchurch charged with murder the Australian national Brenton Tarrant, 28, identified as the main mosque shooter. He will receive additional charges, said the court. Another shooter, 18, was charged on the same day with “intent to excite hostility or ill-will.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Sahrawis Alliance in Europe for Development and Solidarity organized a sit-in at the United Nations Square in Geneva on Saturday to denounce what it described as the “crimes committed by the Polisario militia in the Tindouf camps.” Through the sit-in that is organized on the sidelines of the 40th session of the Human Rights Council, the grass-roots organization condemned “the silence of the international community and the United Nations about the crimes committed against children soldiers in the Tindouf Camps.” In the Tindouf Camps, children from 7 to 14 years old were taken from their families and sent to different countries for training on the use and handling of firearms and explosives. The participants said that many children have died as a result of handling explosive devices and been buried in anonymity, while survivors are enlisted in armies, guerrillas or terrorist groups. The secretary-general of the Alliance, Ali Jeddou, stressed that the sit-in seeks to alert the international community about the “massive violations of human rights” in the Tindouf camps and to call the forces of peace, democracy, and freedom to intervene and exert greater pressure to end the ordeal of children associated with armed forces or groups. In a statement to the press, Jeddou said the participants in the rally urge “the international community and international humanitarian organizations to urgently intervene to put an end to the plight of our families confined to the repressive Tindouf camps under the implacable control of the Polisario that violates the most basic human rights.” He also noted that the abuse committed by the Polisario and supported by the Algerian military push more and more young people in the Tindouf camps to throw themselves in the arms of the terrorist groups and the criminal networks which skim the Sahelo-Saharan zone. The sit-in is part of a large awareness campaign called “White Dove”, initiated by the Alliance in order to draw the attention of the public opinion on the “human rights violations committed by Polisario front.”. On March 6, several Sahrawi MPs staged a sit-in in front of Polisario’s secretariat to protest widespread corruption in Tindouf camps. In a public statement, the MPs said they were protesting the waste of public money, abuse of authority for personal purposes, absence of accountability, and the prevalence of all kinds of corruption.

Rabat – Australian journalist, academic, and writer Waleed Aly devoted the recent episode of his broadcast The Project to share his thoughts and to condemn the terror attack committed against two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The message of the prominent host was widely shared and received hundreds of thousand comments. In his address, Aly said that he was not unsure about whether to speak about the terror attack, which claimed the lives of 50 people and injured 50 more. The journalist, however, said that he felt responsible to speak about the attack. “Of all the things that I could say tonight, that  I’m gutted and I’m scared and I feel overcome out of hopelessness,” he said. In the emotional speech he delivered with a cracking voice, Aly added that “the most dishonest thing would be to say that I’m shocked. I’m simply not. There is nothing about what happened in Christchurch today that shocks me.” The Muslim journalist, who said he attended Friday prayers at a local mosque, said that he knows what the moments before the shooting occurred must have been like. “I know how quiet, how still, how introspective those people would have been before they were suddenly gunned down.” The journalist, whose facial expression spoke volumes about how he feels about the murder, plead for unity in the world to combat violent attacks targeting Muslims. “Now, we come together, Now we understand that this is not a game. Terrorism doesn’t choose its victims selectively,” he said. “You’ll have to forgive me, these won’t be my best words…” On this heartbreaking day, Waleed reflects and calls for unity. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/mIOI0eGamb — The Project (@theprojecttv) March 15, 2019  “That we are one community and that everything we say to try to tear people apart, demonize particular groups, set them against each other, that all has consequences even if we’re not the ones with our fingers on the trigger.” The attack caused international indignation, with world leaders strongly slamming the attack. King Mohammed VI was in the list of world leaders who condemned the attack. The 28-year-old attacker live-streamed the shooting, which showed him carrying a rifle and shooting at people deliberately. The video showed the attacker repeatedly pointing his rifle and shooting again at anyone trying to move. Facebook said in a statement that its staff is working to remove the videos of the shooting. “In the first 24 hours we removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, of which over 1.2 million were blocked at upload,” reads the statement.

Rabat –  Spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, said that the United Nations is waiting for the final announcement of UN Personal Horst Kohler with regard to the second roundtable discussion over Western Sahara. When asked if there are more updates about the date, Dujarric said that “there are different reports. Different people say different things.” He added that the UN is waiting for Kohler to “line up all his proverbial ducks and get an announcement out.” “Erol, and then we’ll go to the back, and then we‘ll go to the background briefing.” Earlier this week, AFP reported that Kohler submitted invitations to the parties involved in the conflict. While Morocco did not confirm receiving invitations from Kohler, Morocco’s state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the personal envoy sent “similar invitation letters” to Morocco, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and the Polisario. Well-informed sources in Geneva recalled that the Security Council encouraged Morocco and Algeria and the other parties to “work constructively with the Personal Envoy in a spirit of compromise, throughout the duration” of the UN-led political process to ensure its success. The new roundtable will be a second of its kind as all parties convened in the first roundtable held in Geneva on December 5-6. Prior to the meeting in the second roundtable, Kohler is believed to have met with representatives of all parties involved in the conflict. Kohler met with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in Paris on February 27-28. Several Algerian news outlets rumored about a secret meeting between Kohler and Algeria’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel on March 2.

The inaugural session is being held under the theme “India and Africa: Shaping a Global Partnership for a Better World.” The official agenda of the forum explains that the the first session will discuss several aspects including trade, sustainable development, and solar energy. The first session agenda shows that the India-Africa Partnership has “assumed critical importance for the Global economy that is currently shackled by a slowdown, moderating trade and investment flows, growing trade protectionism and tightening financing conditions.” Representatives will answer several questions, including whether India’s industry will be “playing a bigger Part in Africa’s manufacture renaissance,” and “how best can India partner and finance Africa’s regional infrastructure development projects.” The conference announced that 21 African countries confirmed their participation in the working sessions of the meeting, including Morocco, Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya. General Director of Moroccan Agency of Investment and Development (AMDIE) Hicham Boudraa is among the Moroccan delegation that traveled to India to participate in the symposium. Morocco’s participation shows the will and determination of both India and Morocco to boost their partnership. The participation follows an official visit from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj at the request of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During her visit in February, the Indian official held several meetings with Moroccan senior officials. India and Morocco also signed four Memorandum of Understandings, including one to create a security cooperation group to combat terrorism. India holds a special importance over the symposium, which was launched by CII in partnership with Exim Bank of India in 2005. “Over the last thirteen editions, it has emerged as the pioneer event in building partnerships and enhancing the economic engagement between the two regions,” said the official website of the event. In a previous statement on the event, former president of India Pranab Mukherjee said that the Conclave “has become a prestigious event for Indian and African governments and industry to meet and explore new avenues of partnerships.” The annual symposium also convenes representatives from African countries, allowing them to “take stock of the progress of the partnership and address future needs in this regard,” the former official said.

Rabat – A young student from New Zealand visited a mosque in Netherlands to show solidarity and support for Muslims. With tears and cracking voice, the student showed respect and solidarity with the people, apologizing for the attacks that claimed the lives of 50 victims during a planned terror attack by a 28-year old Australian on Friday. A video filmed  by theatermaker Salaheddine Benchikhi shows the student expressing his regret and giving his condolences to Muslims in the Essalam Mosque in Rotterdam. “I am from from New Zealand and I have bought some flowers  for the people there. And I don’t know what I can do, but I have to do something for the people there,” the young student told Benchikhi. After his heartwarming message, Benchikhi hugged the student in an emotional moment. Benchikhi also interviewed more people who brought flowers to the mosques to express solidarity. One of the interviewees said that citizens are relying on the government to ensure security and stability.  The two people said that they are mourning for the people in New Zealand and that it’s their “turn to give flowers and to tell the people they love them.” New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited the attacked mosques on Sunday. Photo of her hugging Muslims went viral on social media. While world leaders and people around the world slammed the massacres, some Western tabloids showed sympathy with the 28-year old attacker, Brenton Tarrant. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid labelled the attacker an “angelic boy who grew into an evil far-right ass killer.” The daily also put a photo in its cover, showing Tarrant as a young boy. The tabloid also described the attacker as a “likeable and dedicated personal trainer running free athletic programmes for kids.” The description received strong and condemning comments on social media. There is absolutely no chance a newspaper would splash a childhood photo of an Islamist terrorist who murdered 49 Christians in a church as an “angelic boy”. Displacing focus from the victims to oh how could such a sweet WHITE boy become a terrorist is abhorrent pic.twitter.com/pcQCOBzMpT — Owen Jones🌹 (@OwenJones84) 16 mars 2019  British columnist and political commentator Owen Jones slammed the tabloid, saying that “there is absolutely no chance a newspaper would splash a childhood photo of an Islamist terrorist who murdered 49 Christians in a church as an “angelic boys.” He added, “Displacing focus from the victims to oh how could such a sweet WHITE boy become a terrorist is abhorrent.” The attacks on two mosques in Christchurch claimed the lives of 50 and injured at least 50 others. The victims are aged between 3 and 77.

Casablanca – “I decided to settle here, to participate, and to build a house, somehow,” reflects filmmaker Nabil Ayouch, on his decision to relocate to Morocco nearly 20 years ago.  Born in 1969 to a Moroccan father and a Tunisian-Jewish mother, Ayouch grew up in a Paris suburb. It was there, during his adolescence, that he discovered cinema, an experience he describes as opening “a window to the world” and the beginning of a lifelong engagement with the art. Now one of Morocco’s foremost directors, Ayouch’s own kaleidoscopic background informs the stories he tells about Morocco’s diverse traditions, religious history, and languages. Throughout his childhood, Ayouch regularly visited his father’s family in Morocco, but it was not until 1999 that he settled here. Since then, he has established himself in Casablanca, where we spoke on a Tuesday afternoon. Casablanca is itself a city of stark contrasts: A sleek black Mercedes and a cart pulled by donkey might well pass one another on the street. There are chapters of the country’s history exposed on buildings’ facades. Art Deco buildings line downtown streets, facing boxy, brutalist concrete buildings constructed after independence, not far from grand Neo-Moorish architecture (as displayed in the city’s major train stations, Casa Port and the newly renovated Casa Voyageurs). In pockets of the city and concentrated around its periphery are areas of intense poverty. It is these communities that Ayouch has sought to render in his films “Ali Zaoua” (2000) and “Horses of God” (2012), which competed at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. Ayouch’s films are unwavering in their commitment to marginalized voices, unflinching in their depictions of violence and sex, and unsparing in their critique of hypocrisy and contradiction in sectors of Moroccan society, religion, and the government. All of this makes Ayouch a polarizing figure and has earned him the ire of politicians and the public. At times, the controversies threaten to eclipse the films themselves. The 2015 film “Much Loved” (or “Zin li Fik,” a Moroccan phrase which translates as “the beauty that is in you”) tells the stories of sex workers in Marrakech and was banned by the Moroccan government, although footage from the film leaked online. Despite the controversies, or perhaps because of them, Ayouch is often sought after to act as bellwether for Moroccan cinema. Both “Much Loved” and “Razzia” (2017) opened at the Cannes Film Festival, and Ayouch also became the first Moroccan director invited as a lifetime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2017. In person, Ayouch’s demeanor is measured and calm. Conversing in English, we discussed the role of languages in his films, his background, the politics of “protection” from art, and the genre of science fiction. Of course, language defines any character: Where it comes from, its background, its origin. But, more specifically, if we speak about the Arabic language, it’s even more weird. We have a strange relationship with our own language. We have a strange relationship to what we are. I think we haven’t yet solved some problems we have with our identity, and identity goes through language.
 For example, what we call Darija–I think we should call it the Moroccan language more than Darija­–is our language. Classical Arabic is not our language. It’s a beautiful language. I love Classical Arabic, Fusha, but it’s not our language. Darija is something that defines us. And we should be very comfortable with it. But we’re not. And we find so many ways not to be. This kind of schizophrenia is very interesting because, once again, it defines who we are. In “Razzia,” I wanted to explore more deeply this kind of feeling. Because [of] the Arabization of the educational system. And more, the beginning of the 1980s where reform went into another gear. And this [educational] reform is really something huge in the problem that we’re experiencing today. Because it changed our mental spirit, our mindset. Because it created a gap between those who speak Arabic and those who speak French. Because it created a gap between those who can get a job and those who cannot get a job. Because it created a gap between those who were at home speaking Amazighia [Berber languages]–whether it’s Tashalheet, Talifeet, Tamazight, or Hassani, even–[or] Darija and those who were obliged to speak another language at school.  And when they reach 18 years old, they go to university, [and] because most of the curriculum is not taught in Arabic, they have to switch to French. So, this may cause people to love and hate ourselves at the same time. There were Jews in Morocco as well. Amazigh, Jews, and then the Arabs. I think it’s very closely linked to my background. My multiple identities, and the fact that I probably didn’t know what to do with the cultures and religions that I had inside. Because there was my Jewish family, my Jewish traditions. But when I went back to Morocco for the holidays, I was with my Muslim family. [In France,] I went to Republican schools. I graduated [from] Catholic schools. And I felt a little bit lost. Meeting cinema was something huge in my life. I met a means of expression and for me it was like opening my eyes to a window to the world. The link with my never-learned identities was built through cinema. It authorizes many possibilities of expressing yourself through something very personal, linked to something that is global. I decided to move to Morocco in 1999, which was very late in my life. I decided to settle down here, to participate. And I was very, very much inspired by this society. Sometimes there are some… hard times, but I really fell in love with the country and the people. And I fell in love with this part of myself that I didn’t know before. For me Morocco represented cultural diversity. It represented people’s cultures, religions that together built this country. And when I arrived here and decided to do some movies, slowly I discovered that certain people wanted to erase this diversity. Language, imposing one language, is a way of authorizing, of erasing this diversity. And I think that in each of my films, I want to say, to express how it hurts me, in one way or another. Whether it’s giving a voice to marginalized people, or whether it’s giving voice to minorities, sexual or religious minorities.  For example in “Razzia” or in “Much Loved” or “Ali Zaoua.” People that we are judging very easily because of what they are, not of who they are. I know the history of this country … I know how beautiful it is, it was, it can be, it can be again. And I’m very sad to see that for political reasons, or ideological reasons, we want to erase that. I came across a quote from government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi in the New York Times in response to “Much Loved.” He said the ban was to “protect freedom of expression, which absolutely does not mean freedom of absurdity and destruction in cinema.” It’s a way of lying to people to make them believe that we’re protecting them by banning films. It’s a way of infantilizing people. Telling them that ‘you’re not smart enough to think by yourself. You have no critical spirit to decide whether you should see or not see this film. Or you’re too young, too immature. We’re going to decide for you.’ So that’s a big lie. And that’s also the answer of the weak: To ban a film and say that we’re banning film to protect Morocco or to protect Moroccan women. I don’t think Morocco is a weak country [that needs] to be protected. I think we’re strong and a strong state cannot be destabilized by a film, or should not be destabilized by a film. And I think that Moroccan women don’t need to be protected either. There are strong women in this country and women with lots of dignity. And some prostitutes that I’ve met are women with lots of dignity. So it’s not a question of protecting a country or women, it’s a question of an ideology, and this ideology doesn’t accept that an artist can express his vision of a topic. I had a question also about “Razzia.” I read that you were originally thinking of making “Razzia” a science fiction film. Why did that genre appeal to you? At that time, I was asking myself lots of questions about what the Arab world could be in the future. I’ve read some science fiction literature and I wanted to confront my vision of a story that would tell us how the Arab world would or could be in 20 years, 30 years. And then came Much Loved, and it changed my vision and it probably gave me a sense of urgency to talk about us today. What about it changed your vision? Was it the film itself or the reaction to the film? The reaction. How hard it was to deal with our image. To deal with everything that the film is about. The condition of women and so on. And it showed me how urgent the need was for me to talk about us today more than tomorrow, or before tomorrow. So I decided to keep the structure of the film as it was at the early stages – meaning five characters, five stories – but to set them today and not tomorrow. When you considered making a science fiction film originally, was there a particular reason you’d gravitated toward the genre? Were there things you thought you better say in that genre? The idea was, as you just said right now, to allow myself to give a vision that would be very personal of what we could be and how we could be the Arab world in 20 years. So something really, like, personal and something really, like, subjective. So that’s why at that time I’d chosen science fiction. I think that freedom of expression should be first on your list. And not to be afraid to express, to speak, to show because cinema is speaking, cinema is showing. And sincerity. I think that there are too many ways to lie today through film. Or not to be sincere with what you’re saying. And I think that you should be very, very sincere with what you’re doing. Which is also very exciting because this country is building, in a sense. It’s probably why I’m so happy to be here every day. With all those choices, you have to make them trust that you’re making the right choice and be really confident in what you’re doing. And that’s why I say that sincerity. Because you [are] expressing a point of view to the world. And the point of view of this region needs to be expressed by young directors from this region, not by other directors. I’m making a film about youth and hip-hop culture in a suburb of Casablanca.

Rabat – Fez Police in collaboration with the Territorial Surveillance Directorate General (DGST) arrested on Saturday morning a 19-year-old trainee from the city’s Institute of Applied Technology (ITA).  The student, believed to be 19 years old, is accused of condoning terrorist acts  in his social media posts. The suspect posted a publication on his Facebook account in which he “praised” the terror acts that targeted people in two mosques in New Zealand on Friday, according to a statement issued by the National Security Directorate General (DGNS).  The New Zealand attacks left 49 people dead and at least 50 more injured, and have been widely condemned by an outpouring of support and sympathy for the victims and their family. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the attacks “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.” According to statement from Fez’s security services, the ITA trainee will be referred to the Judicial Investigation Central Bureau (BCIJ) for further investigation into his perceived espousal of extremist views. In Morocco, incitement to terrorism in Morocco is currently punishable by five to fifteen years in prison. Until 2015, the charge was punishable by two to six years in prison. The law changed following concerns about the repatriation of fighters from zones of conflicts in the Middle East. Elsewhere, other inflammatory reactions to the tragedy in New Zealand incurred the wrath of world leaders and internet users. After news emerged of the terrorist attacks in New Zealand, Australian Senator Fraser Anning controversially blamed the attacks on Muslims, claiming that “massive Muslim migration” to New Zealand was normalizing violence in the country.

Rabat – New elements in the “mysterious death” of Moroccan-born model Iman Fadil have suggested that the woman did not die of a natural death, implying she may have been poisoned. Italian magistrates have opened a murder investigation to shed further light on Fadil’s death, Italian outlet ANSA reported yesterday. Fadil is believed to have felt some degree of strangeness in her actions and sense of being prior to her death. She told her brother and lawyer that she had been poisoned, according to ANSA. Fadil’s brother and lawyer later revealed that she died “after a month of agony,” the newspaper added. The preliminary results of the ongoing murder investigation appear to buttress Fadil’s claims. A toxicology test has established that the former model died of “a mixture of radioactive substances,” local reports have concurred. Fadil, who was a key witness in the “bunga-bunga trial” involving former Italian Prime Minister and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, was due to give evidence against Berlusconi. In the wake of the bunga-bunga trial, also known as the “Ruby affair,” Berlusconi had pleaded not guilty. He accused critics of using the affair to further tarnish his then-suffering political reputation. The court initially acquitted Berlusconi in 2015 on the grounds that he did not know the real age of Karima El Mahroug, a then-17-year-old teenage girl who was part of the cohort of strippers whom Fadil claimed were paid into having sex with Berlusconi and his entourage. Fadil has maintained over the years that the trial that acquitted Berlusconi had missed the true extent of his involvement in the abusing and silencing of the “bunga-bunga girls.” Part of the new evidence suggests that Fadil may have been poisoned to prevent her from giving damming evidence against Berlusconi, who she claimed gave many of the girls enormous sums of money, threatening them to keep silent. According to Huffington Post Italy, Fadil had been working on a memoir when she died. Titled “I met the devil,” the book gives first-hand accounts of parts of the episodes that have not yet come to light in the Ruby affair, according to the newspaper. Huffington Post Italy cited parts of the unpublished memoir as reading: “Everything started when I was 25. I am 34 now. I have always told the truth and I have rejected countless corruption attempts from Berlusconi and his entourage.” Meanwhile, Berlusconi is adamant that Fadil’s story is a fabrication. “I have never known Iman Fadil,” the former Italian PM has been quoted as maintaining. Magistrates await the complete results of the ongoing murder investigation to deliberate on the credibility of the new evidence appearing to incriminate Berlusconi.

Rabat – Pierre Sarkozy, known professionally as Mosey, will come to the dance floor of La Bodega restaurant in Casablanca on March 29. Sarkozy is the oldest son of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The 34-year-old DJ “will mix for several hours in an authentic atmosphere,” said the event organizers.  Mosey is a former producer of French 1990s hip hop artist Doc Gyneco. He has also remixed “Miss You” by Rolling Stones, which was covered by Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, his step-mother, in her 2017 album “French Touch.” Mosey abandoned his studies of law to pursue a career in music. During his father’s presidency, between 2007 and 2012, Mosey did not speak publicly about his father or politics, according to French radio station Generations. In August 2017, Mosey came to mix for one night at the Restaurant du Port in Mohammedia, a city neighboring Casablanca. Mosey is not the only one in his family to visit Morocco. Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife spent New Year’s Eve in Marrakech to ring in 2019. In 2015, Mosey made the news when he played at a party “organized for the 67th anniversary of Israel,” according to Israeli news website Ynet.

Rabat – Fearing that the Bouteflika regime is trying to trick them into ending their protests without achieving what they were aiming for, Algerians are out asking that the president step down as soon as possible. Algeria and the world reacted euphorically earlier this week to the announcement that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was no longer interested in re-election. Bouteflika’s office announced that he had “understood Algerians” and was ready to give in for the good of the country. For his decision to give up on his re-election bid, however, Bouteflika asked Algerians to allow him to stay in power indefinitely until a postponed election, originally scheduled for April 18. Algerians welcomed the news at first. As far as they were concerned, Bouteflika stepping down was a “small victory” needed for the advent of the “new Algeria.” Since Thursday, however, Algerians have experienced a change of heart about Bouteflika’s “grand plan.” In place of the celebratory mood on Monday, there now unfolds suspicion about the regime’s sincerity. Many took to the streets on Friday to denounce what they saw as the regime’s latest move to cling to power. “Bouteflika and his men must go as soon as possible,” Britain’s the Guardian quoted a 23-year-old protester as saying. In the boisterous streets of Algiers on Friday, others echoed the young protester’s sentiment, appearing to suggest that the president and his entourage have an ulterior motive. Algerian civil society movements agreed. They urged more protests, saying the regime is playing “trick and divide” to survive. The protests come as Noureddine Bedoui, the newly-appointed prime minister, promised that a new “technocratic government” would be formed as soon as next week. Bedoui said that he would “take into account the message of the protesters during the formation of the government.” Meanwhile, there are reports that some members of the political establishment, sensing that this may be the last stop for a regime that has ruled for two decades, are joining the camp of protesters. “Game over. Bouteflika has no choice but to quit now,” members of the president’s inner circle told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Rabat – Morocco’s Secretary of State to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Mounia Boucetta met on Wednesday and Thursday in Budapest with the Hungarian secretary of state for economic diplomacy, Levente Magyar.  Magyar expressed Hungary’s will to support Morocco in managing migration through €30 million in financial aid. The package was approved at a summit between eastern European prime ministers and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February. Magyar also highlighted Morocco’s position as a regional hub and competitive platform facilitating access to the African market. The Hungarian official said that Morocco is a “strategic partner of Hungary and a pole of stability in the region.” He expressed Hungary’s “strong commitment to further strengthen bilateral partnership ties” and to diversify cooperation in agriculture, higher education, and air transport. In the wake of the meeting, on Friday, March 15, an Australian extremist carried out a cold-blooded terrorist attack on two New Zealand mosques, driven by anti-immigrant sentiments, according to a manifesto he wrote. Prior to the attack, he reportedly travelled to many Eastern European countries, including Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has spoken out vehemently against immigration and attempted to keep refugees and immigrants out of his country. Last year, Hungary demanded the resignation of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein for criticizing “xenophobes and racists in Europe.”

King Mohammed VI used the Crans Montana Forum, meeting in Dakhla Saturday, as a platform to call for the “century of Africa.” The remarks came in a letter the King wrote to the Crans Montana Forum in Dakhla, which was read by the president of the Dakhla region, Khattat Ynja. Africa was at the forefront of the King’s letter. King Mohammed VI noted how Africa enjoys demographic vitality with the world’s youngest population, “which compels us to launch more development projects capable of transforming the reality of the continent.” He emphasized that the projects place high priority on education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, and the fight against poverty. Addressing these challenges for Africa, he stated, will influence geostrategy internationally. “It’s high time that this century must be the century of Africa,” reads the letter. With a hint of gentle criticism towards the West, the King emphasized, “Africa has chosen openness, refusing the logic of looting the continent of its richness, while preserving the value of sharing and solidarity characteristic of our age old culture.” Why Dakhla? King Mohammed VI also highlighted the importance of Dakhla as a “crossroads for dialogue.” He remarked that in just a few years, the city has managed to stand unparalleled, taking pride in its conviviality and hospitality, which symbolize an Africa capable of living up to international standards. Dakhla, which is nicknamed the “pearl of the South,” a reference to Morocco’s increased investments in upgrading the business attraction of its southern provinces, also hosted last year’s Crans Montana Forum. Beyond its interest in attracting investment and business ventures to the country’s southern provinces to transform them into “continental hubs,” there are suggestions that the Moroccan government is seeking to capitalize on the forum to exhibit the enormous development efforts Morocco is making in Western Sahara.  While attending last year’s forum, many participants applauded the socio-economic transformations witnessed in Dakhla in recent years as a result of sustained investment efforts from the Moroccan government. The King expressed his pleasure at the historic assembly, which he said “stands out as an important gathering in the quest for reflection and practical and innovative responses to sustainable socio-economic development.” Crans Montana, he added, draws a large number of high-level participants from all walks of life and from all over the world. This year’s Crans Montana Forum is the fifth time that Morocco hosts what is widely regarded as one the continent’s biggest reunions of world leaders, investors, and change makers in Africa and beyond. Reverend Jesse Jackson, a civil rights icon in the US, who participated in last year’s event, said that forums like Crans Montana are needed to cement South-South momentum on the world stage. Jackson went on to stress Morocco’s growing role in African affairs. He called the kingdom “a light-bearer of African solidarity.”

Rabat- Appearing to have been outraged by inflammatory comments in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, a 17-year-old boy cracked a raw egg on the head of an Australian senator during a news conference in Melbourne on Saturday. Although Senator Fraser Anning called the New Zealand mosque shootings an “unfortunate tragedy,” he appeared to double down on his earlier statements. He argued in the news conference that “this sort of things will soon be accepted and expected as normal.” The allusion was to his usual trope of Muslims’ and immigrants’ incompatibility with the Australian or Western way of life. But Anning did not have time to elaborate further. Behind him, a white-shirted teenager cracked an egg on the senator’s head. The senator then replied in kind, punching and kicking the boy. The audience intervened, stopping the boy from responding to the senator’s outburst. “Police said the boy was arrested but was released without charge pending a further investigation. No motive was offered for the egging,” the Chicago Tribune reported. Although there is no evidence they also used eggs to convey their displeasure, many international leaders had strongly criticized the senator’s initial comments soon after news emerged of a heinous attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemned the attacks, saying it was “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.” Many world leaders joined in, including King Mohammed VI. They all sent “prayers and thoughts” to the families of victims, urging that such acts should not have the upper hand on “our common humanity.” For Anning, however, the attacks happened because of “Muslim migration.”
He said in a statement, “The real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” On Twitter, Anning asked whether anyone “still disputes the link between Muslim immigration and violence.” In Australia, ministers and MPs have been quick to slam Anning, discrediting his platform and saying he is not representative of the country’s stance on Islam and migration and “should be ashamed of himself.” Australian Minister Scott Morrison said that Anning’s conflation of violence and terrorism with immigration and Islam is “appalling” and has no place in the country’s political culture. Meanwhile, critics of Australia’s far-right platforms have suggested that Anning’s comments are motivated by a desire to secure a senatorial election in May. The senator’s slamming of Muslims and immigrants was an easy route to appeal to far-right and white supremacist electors to maintain his senatorial seat, they argued. Others suggested that Anning is no different than the terrorist who killed 49 people who were calmly attending to their religious duty. The spokesman of the Australian National Imams Council, Bilal Rauf, remarked, referring to Anning’s comments, “When one looks at his statement, it may as well have been an extract from the manifesto of the person that perpetrated these heinous crimes, this act of terrorism in Christchurch.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Navy frigate “Mohammed VI” is taking part in the Obangame Express 2019, an annual multinational maritime exercise off the coast of Lagos, Nigeria.  Obangame Express, which began Friday, March 15, is the largest maritime security exercise in Africa. The exercise will continue until March 22. Conducted by US Naval Forces Africa, the Obangame Express exercise sees the participation of more than 30 countries, including 20 African countries and 11 allied countries from Europe and the Americas. While most of the African participating countries are in central and West Africa, Morocco is the only North African country to join the exercise. Launched by the Nigerian navy and held every year since 2011, the Obangame Express 2019 looks to increase inter-agency and transnational cooperation between African countries especially those bordering the Gulf of Guinea.  The exercise will take place in the ocean between Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria and is set to improve nautical safety and step up security measures. Besides improving joint cooperation, the event also plans to address maritime domain awareness and information-sharing and to enhance the collective capabilities of Gulf of Guinea and West African navies to counter illegal activity in the sea, especially piracy and oil bunkering. During the event, navies will perform search and rescue operations and simulate scenarios to combat weapons trafficking. Morocco conducts annual maritime exercises with Spain called MAES. In the last exercise in May 2018, the Spanish “Reina Sofia” ship and Moroccan “Hassan II” ship participated. Morocco also took part in the “Obangame Express” naval exercise last year, conducted at the Douala Naval Base in Cameroon.

By Katya Schwenk Rabat – The 25th annual EMI-Enterprises Forum will take place April 3 and 4 at the Mohammadia School of Engineering (EMI) in Rabat.  For a quarter century, the forum has drawn reputed companies to Rabat to recruit Moroccan students and recent graduates seeking employment. It is the flagship event of EMI, a leading technical university and Morocco’s first engineering school. King Mohammed VI has sponsored the event since 1999. In 2018, the event recorded a stunning attendance of 90 enterprises and over 10,000 visitors.  The forum puts on roundtables, conferences, and workshops in addition to recruitment events, bringing in CEOs and industry experts to coach students on their job hunts and discuss the event’s broader theme.  This year, the theme is “Economic intelligence: a strategic asset for enhancing innovation,” EMI announced in a press release, saying that the topic was at the heart of today’s corporate climate. For Moroccan students, the event offers a chance to connect with potential employers. Morocco’s enduring unemployment problem has frustrated college graduates for years, who often find that a diploma gives them little edge in the job market.  Government employment data released February revealed that diploma holders suffered unemployment rates nearly five times higher than those of non-diploma holders (17.115.4 percent compared to 3.5 percent). These numbers have contributed to the exodus of educated professionals from Morocco in search of employment in recent years. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said in January that more than 600 engineers leave the country each year for work. For Moroccan companies, EMI’s forum may prove one way to combat the brain drain.

Rabat – Prosecutors in Christchurch, New Zealand, charged Australian national Brenton Harrison Tarrant, identified as Friday’s mosque shooter, with murder on Saturday. The 28-year-old, who appeared in court Saturday morning, will receive additional charges, said New Zealand authorities. The court charged a second shooter, 18, with “intent to excite hostility or ill-will.” Police had arrested four suspects after the terror attacks on Friday, March 15, but released one after confirming the individual had been in possession of a gun but was trying to assist police.  The Australian is the main suspect of the terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch that left 49 people dead and at least 50 with injuries. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the suspect as an “extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist.”  According to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the suspect had a firearms licence and owned five guns. She firmly added in a statement: “Our gun laws will change.”  The suspect will remain in custody without a plea and will appear in court again on April 5. The shooter had published a manifesto before committing the attack to explain his goal, describing himself as an “ordinary white man.”  He said he was “inspired” by Norway mass killer Anders Behring Breiving. The suspect also documented the shooting through a live video on Facebook. Facebook has since taken down his account. New Zealand officials have not yet released the names of the victims, but they published a list of those missing on the New Zealand Red Cross website. The list includes people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – After two deadly plane crashes in recent months, Boeing said it will unveil a software upgrade for its 737 Max aircraft in 10 days. The cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 has not yet been determined, but the Boeing company announced that it is fixing its jets’ Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The MCAS is a system of safety sensors and software that Boeing designed for its 737 Max to prevent the aircraft from entering into a stall, flaps-retracted, low-speed, nose-up flight. “It uses airspeed and other sensor data to compute when a dangerous condition has developed and then trims the aircraft nose down.” There are steps a pilot can take if the MCAS turns on in error. However, if the pilot experiences difficulty switching it off, the MCAS will continue to nose the plane down. The similarities between the Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash have brought attention to the possibility of MCAS malfunctions. The striking similarities “warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that need to be better understood and addressed,” said the US-based Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA and Boeing had already implicated MCAS as the likely cause of the Lion Air crash which killed 189 people. When the Ethiopian Airlines flight on the same Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed on Sunday, six minutes after take-off, it killed all 157 people on board, including two Moroccans. Boeing said that after ten days, it will have fixed its MCAS software for the 737 MAX aircraft. All Boeing 737 MAX planes are currently temporarily grounded at Boeing’s recommendation.

Rabat – The international community has criticized Fraser Anning, an Australian rightwing MP for blaming the March 15 terrorist shootings in two New Zealand mosques that killed 49 people on “increasing Muslim presence.” Anning tweeted on Friday: “Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?” In a statement, Anning said: “While this kind of violent vigilantism can never be justified, what it highlights is the growing fear within our community, both in Australia and New Zealand, of the increasing Muslim presence.” Several politicians and international public personalities condemned the senator’s remarks, describing them as “disgusting” and calling him a “disgrace” to the Australian Senate. The UK home secretary, Sajid Javid, strongly denounced Anning’s statements that came at a time of “grieving and reflection.” He wrote on his Twitter account: “Australians will be utterly ashamed of this racist man. In no way does he represent our Australian friends.” Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, commented: “The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, rightwing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting. Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian parliament.” Meanwhile, the former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wrote: “Fraser Anning’s comments today are contemptible. He is a disgrace to the Senate and, what is worse, by spreading hatred and turning Australians against each other, he is doing exactly what the terrorists want.” Anning frequently tweeted anti-immigrant and anti-Islam opinions. Just three days before the attack, he tweeted, “Islam is NOT compatible with Australia and our politics.” The same day, he tweeted, “I stand totally against any Muslims in our Parliament.” On Sunday, March 10, Anning expressed his support for citizens to bear arms to protect themselves from “African gangs and Muslim terrorists.” Australians are facing dangerous African gangs and Muslim terrorists more and more frequently. We need castle doctrine and the right to bear arms so law abiding citizens can defend themselves against these murderous criminals. — Senator Fraser Anning (@fraser_anning) March 10, 2019  A petition was created on Friday on Change.org, calling for the expulsion of Anning from Parliament. The New Zealand city of Christchurch lived a nightmare on Friday. The terrorist attack on the two mosques left 49 people dead and at least 50 more injured. One of the attackers shared a 73-page manifesto to justify his attack. He live-streamed the shooting, which showed him carrying a rifle and shooting at people deliberately. The video showed the attacker repeatedly pointing his rifle and shooting again at anyone trying to move. Muslims and non-Muslims have all expressed sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families.

Rabat – The Italian company Danieli will construct a steel plant in Jorf Lasfar, one of the biggest ports in Morocco, on the Atlantic coast southwest El Jadida. According to a statement from the company, the new plant will feature “the most advanced technological packages.” Naming some of its industrial packages, the company said that the new plant will include “EAF Q-Melt Suite with MELT MODEL system, LINDARC off-gas laser system, Q-REG+ electrode regulation system, Q-EBT Sand for automatic EBT sand refilling, and THOR 3K, the Danieli automatic EAF de-slagging door.” The company said that the new plan “will produce 800,000 tpy of 130×130 – 200×200 mm billets.” The 27-year-old company specializes in heating and “heat treatment systems in the steel  industry.”

Rabat – A group of Belgian students are receiving backlash for mocking Islam in a ceremony to celebrate 100 days before the end of the school year. Under the theme “Saudi Arabia,” students wore burqas and abayas at the Paters Jozefieten Catholic High School in the town of Melle in Belgium. Videos and photos of the students wearing Muslim clothes were shared online. Some students wore keffiyeh and military clothes with fake suicide belts. Videos also show students in a school square pretending to perform Muslim prayers with a fake imam, bowing and kneeling with outspread hands, and shouting “Allahu Akbar.” While the ceremony was held in February, social media users have been sharing the videos throughout March, generating hundreds of thousands of comments criticizing the school. The school principal, Jan De Gendt, apologized on behalf of the students and the school in a Facebook post.  Gendt said the school did not aim to “insult or hurt anyone. We are sorry that people in the school or outside the school were offended by our 100-days activities.” The videos angered Muslims and non-Muslims who condemned the school for allowing students to mock Islam. A popular radio presenter and YouTuber in Belgium, Zaki Chari, condemned the usage of the Islam theme, emphasizing that he would feel “extremely uncomfortable” if he were a student at Paters Jozefieten. 
An independent MP of the Brussels Regional Parliament, Mahinur Ozdemir, also strongly criticized the school event. Ozdemir said, “It is scandalous that these students chose the theme as ‘Islam and Saudi Arabia’ and imitated prayer moves wearing headscarves and bomb belts, therefore relating Muslims with terrorism.” Ozdemir also accused the school of normalizing events that lead to Islamophobia.

Rabat – Western Sahara is historically a Moroccan territory, and the Polisario Front is a mouthpiece of regimes and movements hostile to Moroccan interests, according to Spanish politician Jorge Verstrynge Rojas. Rojas, a known figure in Europe’s conservative circles who served as secretary general of the Spanish People’s Alliance, made his comments in Dakhla on Friday while taking part in the 2019 Crans Montana Forum, Moroccan outlet MAP reported. A connoisseur of North African politics and history, Rojas suggested that Algeria and leftist movements in Europe “fabricated” the conflict in Western Sahara to undermine Morocco’s “historical legitimacy on its southern territories.” “Western Sahara is and has always been part of Morocco,” he said. “The ‘Sahrawi people’ does not exist. It is the creation of Algeria and a large part of the Spanish left which are still not ready to come to terms with the fact that the territories are Morocco’s.” Rojas joined Spain’s leftwing Podemos party in 2014 as a political advisor.
Like a number of leftist parties, Podemos maintains that Morocco is “occupying” Western Sahara and “colonizing its people.” Rojas suggested that he values historical facts more than ideological consistency and revolutionary fervor. He said, “Although I feel very close to Podemos, I am obliged to say things as they are.” The Spanish politician said Algeria, Polisario’s strongest supporter, would be better served by attending to its own issues. “Algeria should address its own problems instead of interfering in Morocco’s issues with its Sahara.” Rojas’s remarks come as Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario Front, and Mauritania prepare to meet in the second Geneva round table the UN is hosting on Western Sahara March 21-22. The meeting is part of the UN-sponsored process to find a lasting and mutually acceptable settlement to the conflict. Polisario and its supporters are calling for a referendum on self-determination, while Morocco maintains that it will agree to no settlement outside its 2007 Autonomy Plan. Morocco’s plan, which calls for local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, has been described as “serious and realistic” by many governments, including France and the US.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy has rescued 21 migrants, including 13 women, who were trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Spain. However, 45 migrants, all sub-Saharan Africans, died at sea. The Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders) collective, which alerts naval authorities about migrant boats in distress at sea between Morocco and Spain told the Associated Press on Thursday that there were pregnant women among the migrants who drowned. “There was also one young girl, between 12 and 14 years old, who didn’t survive,” said Helena Maleno, the Tangier-based NGO’s spokesperson. The undocumented migrants’ boat sunk two hours after they called Walking Borders. The migrants were screaming that they were drowning, Maleno said. Thousands of migrants throw themselves at the mercy of the sea as they attempt to cross to Europe, and many die as a result. Last year,  2,075 people died or went missing crossing the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). November 2018 was the deadliest month in 2018, since as many as 631 African migrants died while trying to cross to Spain. Although IOM reported that 2,075 people from Africa and the Middle East drowned in the sea in 2018, 104,506 migrants arrived by sea in Europe as of last November. In the same period, 7,100 Moroccans attempted to cross to Spain, according to official Spanish sources. On December 23 a tragic migration story made headlines. More than 100 undocumented migrants landed in southern Spain by boats from Morocco. Two babies who were in the boats died on the way and were thrown into the sea.

Rabat – Weeks after Spain’s King Felipe VI visited Morocco and called on King Mohammed VI to accelerate the fight against irregular immigration, the two countries are preparing to deport thousands of unaccompanied Moroccan minors from Spain. Morocco’s director of immigration and border surveillance, Khalid Zerouali, met the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid, Karima Benyaich, and Spanish officials on February 26 to discuss ways to deport unaccompanied Moroccan minors from Spain. Many minors are currently living in juvenile detention centers or are homeless. Spain emphasized that it is specifically working to repatriate the minors who “did not adapt to life in Spain.” The meeting in Madrid was a first step to gather information about unaccompanied minors in the city and other regions with a heavier population of Moroccan minor migrants, especially Catalonia and Andalusia. Recently, Spain proposed a bill to repatriate Moroccan minors. Unaccompanied Moroccan minors represent 70 percent of the more than 7,000 minors in the care of Spain’s regional governments, according to data from the Spanish government. In 2018, almost all of the 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region who entered the Spanish enclave of Ceuta bordering northern Morocco were Moroccan. Upon arriving in Rabat on February 13, King Felipe VI of Spain held talks with King Mohammed VI and signed 11 bilateral agreements covering various issues related to migration, collaboration on security, energy, culture, trade, and aeronautics, among others. This month, the Moroccan government council approved two draft laws related to the signed agreements: Draft Law 15.19 on cooperation against crime in all its forms and Draft Law 16.19 on Spain’s irrevocable offer of Tangier’s Teatro Cervantes (Grand Theater Cervantes) to Morocco.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in the New Zealand mosque attacks. In his message to New Zealand General Governor Patsy Reddy, the monarch expressed his firm condemnation of the “abject racist and terrorist attack, which has targeted” Muslims. The attacks, according to the King, are a flagrant violation of the sacredness of places of worship and the universal human values of coexistence, tolerance, and fraternity. The King then expressed his “heartfelt condolences and sincere feelings of compassion.” The terror attack, committed by an unknown number of attackers, including one 28-year-old Australian national, killed 49 people and injured at least 50 others. My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2019  Several world leaders expressed condolences and condemned the deadly terrorist attack. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the attack as the “latest example of rising racism and Islamophobia.” While most world leaders were unequivocal in expressing their sympathy towards the families of the victims, as well as the Muslim community throughout the world, while calling for fighting Islamophobia, American President, Donald Trump, posted a message in which he simply said, “My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques.” Trump added, “49 seriously injured. The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also condemned the terror attacks, saying that  “Canadians across the country were appalled to wake up to news of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed and injured so many people, including children.” “Far too often, Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain in the places where they should feel safest. Canada remembers too well the sorrow we felt when a senseless attack on the Centre culturel islamique de Québec in Ste-Foy claimed the lives of many innocent people gathered in prayer,” added the statement of the prime minister. Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, and Lebanon have all expressed solidarity with the victims of the families after the heinous attacks.

Iran did not give an official explanation for its absence, but media reports claimed that the Moroccan government did not allow two diplomats who formerly worked at the Iranian embassy in Rabat to participate. The diplomats had been in Rabat before Morocco cut ties with Iran in May 2018. The Moroccan government allegedly requested that only an Iranian delegation, led by Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, enter Morocco. The Iranian delegation, however, rejected that any of its delegates be excluded and chose not to participate altogether. The Turkish delegation raised questions about Iran’s absence, to which Mouhamed Khouraichi Niass, the secretary-general of the PUIC answered that it was out of his control. A source in the Parliament later denied the reports to a Moroccan media outlet, saying that Iran chose not to participate on its own. Meanwhile, at the OIC parliamentary session, Moroccan delegates did not comment on the Iranian delegation’s absence. The meeting reportedly did not go as smoothly as expected with Iran’s absence. Morocco and Iran currently do not share diplomatic relations. In May 2018, Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran. Morocco said that Iran gave financial and military support to the Polisario Front through its proxy, Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militant group. Rabat and Tehran had experienced an on-and-off relationship for years prior. In 2009, Morocco broke ties with Iran after the Persian country threatened Bahrain’s territorial integrity and was spreading Shiism in Morocco. Morocco saw Iran spreading Shiism as interference in its domestic affairs. The relations between the two countries continued to be unstable, although they had mended their bilateral ties in 2014. At the opening of the 41st meeting of the PUIC Executive Committee—held as part of the 14th session PUIC meeting on Monday—Moroccan House Speaker Habib El Malki urged the OIC member states to set aside their differences and work on resolving them through dialogue. “We must leave the controversial issues aside and resolve differences with dialogue and conviction,” El Malki said. El Malki stressed that the OIC should adopt internal dialogue to overcome their differences and that “having different views is the essence of democracy, which should bring benefits to people despite their differences.” The meeting discussed several topics including the activities of the political affairs and foreign relations committee and economic and environment affairs committee. Established in June 1999, the PUIC includes 54 parliaments and 22 regional and international organizations.

Rabat – The 2019 Crans Montana Forum is welcoming high-level figures and senior government officials to Dakhla this weekend, including Liberian Vice President Joseph Boakai and a Liberian delegation. Young leaders like Khadim Diop, the president of the Senegali National Youth Council; Bitania Lulu Berhanu, founding executive director of Ethiopian Youth Alliance for Leadership and Development in Africa (YALDA); and Pour Souleymane Satigui Sidibe, secretary general of the pan-African Union are among the youth representatives. The platform will open officially on March 16 in Dakhla, known as the pearl of southern Morocco. It is the fifth time Morocco has hosted the event. However, the annual forum kicked off its first events on Thursday, March 14. It will run until Sunday, March 17, under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. The theme of the conference is “Building a Powerful and Modern Africa Dedicated to its Youth.” During the event, participants will discuss the digital revolution, universal health insurance, health security, and the development of Africa, particularly renewable energy. The forum will also open dialogue between talented youths on youth business and women’s leadership, economic cooperation between Morocco and central Africa, and initiatives aiming to “facilitate exchanges and discussions between Moroccan Southern Territories’ youth and their peers from all over Africa.” The chair of the event, Pierre-Emmanuel Quirin, said in a press release, “Our primary objective is to go ahead with the same dynamic so that the forum remains a not-to-be-missed gathering for decision-makers and African stakeholders regarding the South-South Cooperation.” The forum will place the highest priority on the needs and priorities of the African youth. Last year’s event, which was organized in the same city, received over 5,000 participants, 50 organizations from 170 countries. Sixty percent of the participants came from Africa. Chairing the 2018 forum, Ambassador Jean-Paul Carteron commended the initiative, saying, “Morocco builds in Dakhla the very example of the African miracle.” The event also includes awards in honor of “exceptional personalities, who work tirelessly for a more Humane World.” Carteron, who founded the forum, said they chose Dakhla in 2015 as the host city because it boasts a strategic location as a hub and extraordinary model for economic and social development. He said it represents an Africa that “takes its destiny in its hands.” Presided over by Pierre-Paul Carteron, the NGO was founded in 1986 in Switzerland with the motto “Towards a more Humane World.”

Rabat – Moroccan Ph.D. student Moussa Bouray, a survivor of the New Zealand terror attacks against two mosques in Christchurch, has spoken out about the shooting. Buray told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that he noticed something was wrong when he was trying to park his car after he arrived at the Al Nour Mosque. Buray said he was with his wife, who had gotten out of the car to enter the mosque. “I saw a large number of worshipers rushing out of the mosque in all directions,” said the Moroccan student. Bouray said that he was still in his car when he heard gunfire. He added that his wife managed to hide in a building when she heard the sound of the gunfire. The student described the terror attack as a “real nightmare,” emphasizing that the security serves quickly spread into the mosque to block the shooter. Despite the quick intervention, the attacker killed 49 people and injured at least 50 more. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern emphasized that the attacks were unprecedented. “Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand,” she said. Muslims and non-Muslims all expressed sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their relatives. One attacker shared a 73-page manifesto to justify his attack. The 28-year-old attacker live-streamed the shooting, which showed him carrying a rifle and shooting at people deliberately. The video showed the attacker repeatedly pointing his rifle and shooting again at anyone trying to move.

Rabat – New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called a press conference on Friday, March 15, in response to a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch that left 49 people dead and at least 50 more injured. Ardern strongly condemned the attack, saying there was “no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.”  She pointed out that “many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand” and that “they may even be refugees.” “They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us.” She advised people in Christchurch to stay inside and remain vigilant as police were still “dealing with an unfolding situation” at the time of the press conference.  Ardern added that although it was too soon to confirm the total number of deaths and injuries, it was already “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”  She reiterated, “The people who were the subject of this attack today, New Zealand is their home. They should be safe here.”  She said the act of terrorism occurred in “a place where people should have been expressing their religious freedom. Where they should have been in a safe environment. And they have not been today.” Australian solidarity Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also released a statement, confirming that one of the four people taken into custody “is an Australian-born citizen.”  He expressed his support for New Zealand, releasing a video of himself saying: “I want to extend to all New Zealanders today, on behalf of all Australians, our sincere and deepest sympathies for the terrible act of violence that was conflicted upon you on this darkest of days.” He added, “We look to New Zealand as family, and at this time of our greatest distress, we stand with you.”  He also reiterated that “all of our (Australian) agencies are there to support New Zealanders at this time … We share these values of coming from so many different backgrounds, and a tolerance and a peaceful living together of people of different faiths and cultures. This is what makes our land so special, and we will never allow any act of violence to violate that.” Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten also said, “We grieve with our brothers and sisters today. We send our love and condolences, our sorrow and solidarity in this terrible time of fear and pain and grief.” Australian MP blames Muslim immigration However, one far-right Australian MP, Fraser Anning, caused global outrage online after he released a statement seemingly blaming New Zealand’s Muslim migrant community for the terrorist act committed against them. He began his statement with: “I am utterly opposed to any form of violence within our community, and I totally condemn the actions of the gunman.” But Anning went on to say, “However, while this kind of violent vigilantism can never be justified, what it highlights is the growing fear within our community, both in Australia and New Zealand, of the increasing Muslim presence.”  Scott Morrison strongly condemned the senator’s statements, responding, “The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, right-wing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting.” “Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.” A petition has been made on change.org to remove the extreme right-wing senator from Parliament, and it already has 70,000 signatures with an end goal of 75,000.

Rabat – Moroccan archaeologist Abdallah Fili will travel to Northwestern University’s Block Museum of Art in the US to present his research on trade and gold in the medieval Sahara, from April 22 to 26. Fili is a professor at Chouaib Doukkali University in El Jadida, a city on Morocco’s Atlantic coast. The week-long symposium dovetails with the museum’s exhibition “Caravans of Gold,” which opened in January. The exhibition investigates medieval Saharan trade, uncovering overlooked ties between European, African, and Middle Eastern societies of the period.  The exposition questions typical narratives of medieval history that revolve around Europe, curator Kathleen Berzock said in a press release. It features medieval art and artifacts that have never been exhibited outside of the Sahara and spotlights the work of African researchers. “With the exhibition we are inviting audiences to throw out their perceptions of medieval knights and castles and journey with us to a medieval world with Africa at its center,” Berzock said.  The museum partnered with archaeologists at research institutes in Mali, Nigeria, the UK, and Morocco, five of whom will join Fili at the symposium. The exhibition zeroes in on their field work, including Fili’s research on the medieval city of Sijilmassa, 90 kilometers south of Errachidia in eastern Morocco. Known locally as the “city of gold,” Sijilmassa, at the northern edge of the Sahara, was a nexus of Saharan trade in the medieval period and the first to mint coins in gold. Its goods and currency circulated into Europe and the Middle East. In Sijilmassa, Fili excavated fragments of materials like glass, lusterware, and terracotta, which the museum displayed in the exhibition alongside other art, an unconventional choice for a major art exhibition. “Archaeology is essentially about fragments,” Fili said in a video for the exhibition. “[It] is a means of showing the complexity of archaeology, and the complexity of archeological interpretation.” Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication announced in February it will hold an international congress to celebrate Sijilmassa, part of its strategy to promote archaeological research in the country. Morocco is rich in archaeological sites, particularly in the under-studied region of Western Sahara. Last year, Morocco classified its Jbel Irhoud site, where archaeologists unearthed the oldest-known remains of homo sapiens, as a site of historical national heritage. Fili’s research is the latest work to bring Moroccan archaeology to the world stage.

Rabat – Algerian Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui has said that he will appoint a technocratic government that will include young protesters who called for political reforms. The prime minister co-chaired a press conference with Deputy Prime Minister Ramtane Lamamra on Thursday. Bedoui said that consultations are under way to form the government, which will be open to the representatives of young Algerians who have rallied for political changes. The government also asked for a transitional phase of no more than one year. After succeeding in convincing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from running for a fifth term, Algerians are protesting his decision  to delay the 2019 election, previously planned for April 18. Bouteflika’s current term ends on April 28. If he remains in power longer, he will be doing so unconstitutionally. Algerian news agency APS reported that the prime minister promised that the government would start to prepare an “inclusive national conference” once a government is appointed. Bedoui noted that Bouteflika requested the formation of a new government. On Monday, Bouteflika announced he would withdraw his candidacy in the 2019 election for a fifth term. The ailing president also announced the appointment of Bedoui, who replaced Ahmed Ouyahia. The new prime minister said that the new government will work to ensure an environment of “trust” and “serenity.” “We are appealing to all political partners, especially those in opposition, to dialogue and to listen to each other in order to overcome the difficult situation in our country,” he said. Despite the promises, Algeria is experiencing another wave of protests on Friday. Protests on March 15 mark the fourth Friday of demonstrations in a row. The protests began by calling for Bouteflika to step out of the presidential race and are continuing against the decision to delay the election. “Leave means leave,” and “We are here for a big clean up,” were among the banners protesters carried, asking for widespread reform. Security services deployed trucks to monitor the protests. In the last three weeks, students, lawyers, and citizens of all ages rallied continuously to protest Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth mandate.  Different days have seen different demographics come out to protest. On Friday, March 8, women turned out in large numbers for International Women’s Day. On Thursday, March 14, many people with disabilities showed up to protest. Bouteflika’s decision to delay the election caused protesters to accuse him of playing tricks to extend his fourth term since he is now not running for a fifth. It remains to be seen whether the protesters will succeed in convincing Bouteflika’s office to hold elections on April 18.

Rabat – Israeli soldiers violently assaulted three American women on vacation in Jerusalem after they tried to help a disabled woman at the Dome of the Rock, also called Al-Aqsa Mosque, on Tuesday, March 12.  Nour Hawash, a nursing student; her mother, Germeen Abdelkarim; and her sister, Safa Hawash, were taking pictures after their midday prayer when the Israeli soldiers stormed the Dome of the Rock and tried to evacuate the place, according to the Palestine Chronicle. Nour reported, “We heard these shots being fired and people just started running all over the place. We saw the IDF [Israeli soldiers], guns pointed, running, trying to chase people. So we just ran with everyone else to the side.” During the evacuation, a disabled woman was being wheeled out of the mosque after her prayer. The confrontation caused her to fall from her chair, and she was unable to climb back into it. Several Muslims tried to help her, but the IDF arrested them. “I saw that a couple of women were trying to help her, but they were being shoved so I tried to go in as well,” Nour said. While she attempted to help the woman, the soldiers forced her to the ground and arrested her. Nour told the soldier that she is an American citizen and tried to show her passport, but the soldier replied, “I don’t care about your ID.” Nour said her sister was also assaulted. “[Safa] was being physically pushed down to the ground, and punched and shoved, they pulled her scarf off and tried to choke with it so she couldn’t come near me.” While soldiers were assaulting her daughters, Germeen was pushed against the wall and arrested. The assault lasted for more than half an hour before a soldier picked up Nour’s passport and instructed the others to release the women. According to a statement published by Palestine’s WAFA news agency, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has accused Israeli soldiers and settlers of “consistently violating the sanctity of the mosque and provoking the sentiments of Muslims.” Israeli forces briefly banned Palestinians, including religious figures, from entering the Al Aqsa compound, which is located near the eastern wall of the old city, causing protests among the Palestinians. According to Israel’s Reshet Kan radio station, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to close the Al-Rahma gates that lead to the southern part of the dome, despite the Palestinians’ protests. Whether this claim is true remains to be seen.

Rabat – At the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) Coordinating Committee meeting on Wednesday, March 13, in Spain, the committee elected Morocco to co-chair the forum with Canada in 2020-2022. It is the third consecutive time the committee has elected Morocco to co-chair the forum. Morocco is currently co-chairing the forum with the Netherlands. Morocco has played an important role in disrupting a number of alleged terrorist cells. According to the director of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, since its beginning in 2015, the BCIJ has dismantled 57 terrorist cells, including 8 cells in 2018, and arrested more than 3,129 people, 292 of whom had a criminal record. Nasser Bourita, the Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, noted that the GCTF had asked Morocco and the Netherlands to continue as co-chairs until 2020, although the current mandate would have ended earlier. “It’s about international cooperation; about how to be effective and how to be responsive to the threat,” Bourita said of the committee. Twenty-nine countries and the EU founded the forum in 2011. It was the first action-oriented international platform dedicated to strengthening civilian counterterrorism cooperation and capacities. GCTF is an international forum with an overarching mission of reducing the vulnerability of people worldwide to terrorism by preventing, combating, and prosecuting terrorist acts as well as countering incitement and recruitment to terrorism. After the GCTF Ministerial Meeting, the committee stated, “We recognize that no state can address these threats alone.” Anicetus Atakpu, a program officer, stated that the key areas the GCTF project targeted is raising community consciousness. After a meeting with the community of Abuja, Nigeria, 63 youth dropped their arms and took an oath to quit violence. The 30 members of the GCTF meet annually each September during the UN general assembly to review the Global Counterterrorism Strategy. The most recent terrorist attack occurred during the midday Friday prayer on March 15, in Christchurch, New Zealand. The shooting resulted in 49 casualties, and at least 50 people were injured. The terrorist attack took place in two mosques, al Noor Mosque on Deans Avenue had 41 casualties, while eight people died at the shooting in Linwood Mosque on Linwood Avenue. The terrorist attack highlights the need for global efforts against terrorism.

Rabat – The Women’s Leadership for Peace Conference opened in Rabat yesterday. The two-day conference brought together scholars, ambassadors, security experts, and theologians to discuss the theme of “Women’s Leadership for Peacebuilding, Countering Terrorism, and Religious Radicalisms.” The conference, organized by the Interfaith and Peacebuilding Research and Training Center in collaboration with the Mohammadian League of Ulemas, Morocco’s highest body of Islamic clerics, is meant to be a platform for exchange and collaboration. In his opening speech, Ahmed Abbadi, the Secretary General of Mohammedian League of Ulemas said that the conference was an opportunity to face the goals of countering hate speech and building a more peaceful, more sustainable society. Women as peacebuilders  Women occupied a prominent spot during discussions. They sought to understand the ways in which women can strengthen peacebuilding capacities and contribute to the fight against terrorism. The UK government contributed to funding the two-day event. When asked about the conference, the British Ambassador Thomas Reilly stressed the importance of associating women to the fight against radicalization. He explained, “Women make up 52 percent of our population and if we leave that part of our society behind we leave behind a whole range of possible solutions to countering radicalization, countering violent extremism, and countering terrorism. To have women involved in that fight, in that generational struggle, is an absolutely essential part of achieving success.” Through presentation of research results, discussion of personal experience, theorization, and debates about politics and theology, the conference’s participants worked towards answering questions relating to women’s role in peacebuilding and security activities.  Aicha Haddou, director of the Morocco Interfaith and Peacebuilding Research and Training Centre and one of the conference’s main organizers, spoke about the emergence of women as major players in mobilizing for peacebuilding. Women, she explained, are increasingly engaged in fighting against extremism and populism. Haddou argued, however, that there currently exists a narrative vacuum regarding women’s role in non-violence and peacebuilding activities. She maintained that, in order to move forward, it is necessary to re-write history to give women their rightful place. Building upon this idea, Sarah Sayeed of Women in Islam Inc. emphasized the importance of giving Muslim women a seat at the table where they are so often the topic of conversation. She argued that in order to create the most successful solutions to the issues at hand, Muslim women must have a hand in policymaking and in shaping their own narrative. In addition to discussions of women’s role in policymaking to deal with the radicalization crisis, there was analysis of research which seeks to understand the radicalization of women themselves. Radicalization of women  Bahija Jamal, an associate professor of international law at Hassan II University in Casablanca addressed the situation of women in Morocco in relation to extremism. According to Jamal, of the 1664 individuals who have joined ISIS from Morocco, 300 have been women.  Jamal’s research did provide clear-cut answers about female radicalization, but she advised against viewing radicalized women as a homogenous bloc. She proposed nuance in dealing with radicalized women, warning that any solution that essentializes extremism would be incomplete. Participants discussed varying responses to terrorism and radicalization across many countries. Jamal explained that the Moroccan response to terrorism involves coherence between three pillars: the reinforcement of security governance; the fight against poverty and social inequality; and the promotion of religious values of tolerance, moderation, and coexistence. Others called for embracing a new way of practicing spirituality.  For Dr. Ramin Jehanbegloo of the Mahatma Gandhi Centre for Non-Violence and Peace Studies, values like moderation and tolerance are of utmost importance in curbing the proliferation of extremist ideas.  Proponents of tolerant and moderate spirituality argued for an emphasis on spirituality and the re-interpretations of religious texts as means of countering the spread of extremist thought. Jehanbegloo spoke passionately about the crisis of spirituality facing the world at large. “Religion without nonviolence is lame and nonviolence without spirituality is blind,” he said.

Rabat – While a number of structural hurdles continue to hurt the Moroccan economy, the country’s financial reforms have paid visible dividends in the past months. The success is reflected in the improved performance and resilience of the dirham, Morocco’s top banking authorities have suggested. Speaking at a conference yesterday in Rabat on “Assessing the Dirham’s First Year of Flexibility,” an allusion to the IMF-approved Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), Mounir Razki, the banking operations chief at Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, said that Morocco can take pride in its “highly resilient” currency. The market value and prospects of the Moroccan dirham (MAD) look more promising than they have ever been in recent years, according to the conference’s speakers. In terms of flexibility and resistance to market shocks and vulnerabilities, the first year of Morocco’s two-year PLL has been “positive in majority,” Razki said. He argued that in spite of persisting economic fragilities such as the budget deficit, Morocco’s economy has shown signs of resilience in the past twelve months. Razki added that the success of the first year of the PLL shows the preparedness of Morocco’s economic institutions as well as the existence of a good basis to implement the flexibility process. Contrary to expectations that the project could downgrade the dirham exchange rate and make it considerably weaker, the currency’s rates have been significantly positive. Since early January, the dirham exchange rate has evolved in the interval of more or less than 2.5 percent, indicating that the currency has gained in strength and value. Hassan Boulaknadal, director of the foreign exchange bureau, echoed Razki’s optimism in the potential of Morocco’s currency market. In addition to positive exchange rates, another sign of the dirham’s improved flexibility process was witnessed in Moroccan banks’ unprecedented level of liquidity and autonomy during the period since the launch of the PLL. Boulaknadal explained that since March of last year, no Moroccan bank has received foreign exchange reserves from BAM.
For both speakers, the banks’ high autonomy level means they, too, have been “put in a comfortable position.” When the IMF approved Morocco’s PLL, it said, “The new PLL arrangement will provide insurance against external shocks and support the authorities’ efforts to further strengthen the economy’s resilience and promote higher and more inclusive growth.” While it is too soon to provide a complete assessment of the project, it is visible that Morocco is on track, according to Razki and Boulaknadal. In terms of internal transactions, a strong exchange rate for the dirham also means that Moroccan importers will register a significant boost in their engagement with foreign markets. The overwhelmingly positive balance-sheet of Morocco’s financial sector is expected to pave the way for the second phase of the flexibility project. However, the speakers cautioned that transition to the next phase should not be made in a rush. Despite the achievements and existing assets, a successful transition requires more preparation and a cautious attitude to the vulnerabilities of the financial market, he noted. The news of a strong MAD comes as Morocco engages in efforts to boost its competitiveness and investment attraction. Over the past three to five years, a number of international financial institutions, including the IMF, have applauded Morocco’s efforts towards improving its business and investment sectors. According to IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa, such measures mean that the country is making “significant strides” to make its economic growth more inclusive and its financial market less vulnerable to external shocks and imbalances.

Rabat – Following the Ethiopian Airlines ET 302 plane crash on Sunday, Boeing recommended airlines ground all 737 Max 8s and Max 9s on Wednesday, March 13. US President Donald Trump announced that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was grounding the planes in the US in a press conference. The announcement comes days after airlines worldwide decided to suspend their use of the Boeing 737 Max 8. Boeing’s recommendation will likely see all 370 planes of the model temporarily grounded. Boeing officials made the decision after the FAA found similarities in the crash between Sunday’s air disaster and a crash with the same plane on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October. The two Boeing 737 Max 8s crashed shortly after takeoff. The FAA said that it made the decision after the investigation “developed new information from the wreckage concerning the aircraft’s configuration just after takeoff.” The FAA investigation found a problem with software that is believed to have played a role in both the Lion Air and Ethiopian crash. Boeing executives stated that they have been working on making a software update since the Indonesian crash. Pilots complaints about the 737 Max 8 In late 2018, pilots in the US had reported their concern over controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off. Pilots had similar difficulties as those that contributed to the Lion Air tragedy. Boeing executives had a meeting with pilots at the Allied Pilots Association’s where numerous complaints were made about Boeing’s new software, that pilots said they did not know enough about. Captain Dennis Tajer, a 737 pilot who attended the meeting, said that Boeing executives told the pilots, “Look, we didn’t include it because we have a lot of people flying on this and we didn’t want to inundate you with information.” ”Well that’s not acceptable,” answered Tajer.

Rabat – As Qatar and Morocco maintain strong diplomatic ties, they are seeking to foster further cooperation. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani held bilateral talks in Rabat with the speaker of the Qatari Advisory Council, Ahmed bin Abdullah bin Zaid Al Mahmoud, at the 14th session of the Parliamentary Union of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Member States. The two officials expressed satisfaction with their diplomatic ties, emphasizing the importance of developing their relations in several sectors, such as economy, politics, and culture. Both officials also said that they share the same views and commitments on important issues, including the Palestinian cause. Al Mahmoud also spoke about his country’s pride in its long-standing and deep friendship with Morocco. Qatar highly appreciated Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis when the Saudi coalition enforced a hard blockade on Qatar in May 2017. Read Also: Timeline: All You Should Know About Morocco-Saudi Arabia Friction King Mohammed VI had ordered his government to offer humanitarian assistance, sending food assistance to Qatar to offer solidarity during the month of Ramadan. King Mohammed VI also flew to Qatar, becoming the first leader to break the blockade. Qatari media showed eminent respect for Morocco and King Mohammed VI, naming him the “first blockade breaker.” Morocco’s position apparently incensed Saudi Arabia, which retaliated with actions against Morocco’s interest. Despite the friction, Morocco and Saudi Arabia have recently touted their partnership in several formal messages. Amid rumors on the friction, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita denied any tension between the two countries, emphasizing that diplomatic ties with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are “historic” and strong. Both countries also renewed their commitment to reinforce their diplomatic ties at the OIC conference. On Tuesday, El Othmani met with Saudi Consultative Assembly Chairman Abdullah Mohammed Ibrahim Al Sheikh, expressing satisfaction with their “long-standing relations.”

By Ahlam Ben Saga &amp; Mohamed Amine Benabou Rabat – The Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has promised to ensure equal access to information, as per Law 13-31 on the right to access information. During the weekly government council on Thursday, March 14, El Othmani called on administrations to proactively release information citizens and businesses request and to make the documents to request information available on their websites. El Othmani stressed that institutions across the country should abide by the law, which came into force on March 12, and to proactively offer information before they receive requests. Administrative institutions should also provide information without delays, said El Othmani. Under the law, administrations are bound to respond to information requests in no less than 20 days. In cases of emergency, citizens must acquire the information in less than 3 days. However, the government can decide to keep information inaccessible when it comes to “safety reasons or life and freedom of individuals.” El Othmani emphasized that the new law will play a major role in enhancing the transparency and credibility of administrations in terms of published information. “Therefore, we are pleased with Law 13-31 because it establishes the right to obtain information in accordance with the conditions stipulated, and this will have a positive impact on the relationship between citizens and administrations,” said El Othmani. Although the law only went into effect this week, the 2011 Constitution already guaranteed the right in Article 27. Article 27 stipulates that “citizens have the right to obtain information held by public administrations, government institutions, and public entities.” On the occasion of law’s enactment, El Othmani congratulated associations and civil society in their role to bring the law into existence. The Moroccan Parliament had adopted the right to information law in February 2018, but its implementation was delayed for more than a year. The law is also not yet applicable because institutions and administrations have to prepare to facilitate the process of disseminating information.  The government has granted a one-year delay before institutions must comply for this reason. Law 13.31, contains eight articles dictating that all Moroccan citizens have the right to access information to ensure transparency, counter corruption, boost the administration’s openness, and establish a culture of good governance and democracy. The law also has serious implications for freedom of speech. Article 6 warns against promoting false information aiming to damage the reputation of individuals, compromising rights, or impairing the public interest, especially if the information will jeopardize the kingdom’s relationships with other countries, international organizations, or the state’s monetary, political, and financial politics. Breaking the law can result in 6 months to 3 years imprisonment and a fine of MAD 150 to MAD 1,500. Offenders can also lose their civil, political, and family rights. The person in charge of delivering information is also subject to disciplinary measures.  In February, Morocco and UNESCO signed an action plan on the right to access information.  The action plan strives to enable Moroccan citizens to access “detailed and transparent” information. It also seeks to allow Moroccans to make their own decisions based on accurate data so that they can fully contribute to the democratic process in the country. In April 2018  Morocco joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as part of 70 countries, 20 local governments, and thousands of civil society organizations. The aim of the OGP is to foster principles of transparency, accountability and improved civic participation in policy-making.

Rabat – Forty-nine people are dead and at least 50 more are seriously injured following an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, March 15.  Forty-one people were killed at al Noor Mosque on Deans Avenue, and eight people died at the Linwood Mosque on Linwood Avenue, according to New Zealand’s Police Commissioner Mike Bush.   Police first received reports of the shootings at 1:40 p.m. Friday, local time, when mosques around the world are busiest as Muslims convene for Friday prayers. One witness, Mohan Ibn Ibrahim, who was inside one of the mosques during the attack, told CNN that the attacker continuously shot at people inside the mosque for “10 or 15 minutes.” He also told CNN, “It’s a big mosque and there were more than 200 people inside. The gunmen came from the backside. Gunshots went on for a long time. We had to jump the wall to escape. I saw lots of broken glass and bricks on the backside of the mosque.” Another witness, Len Peneha, who lives next door to al Noor Mosque, said he saw a man dressed in all black run into the mosque, and then he heard shots and saw people fleeing the mosque. Peneha said he saw the attacker flee the mosque and then drop his semi-automatic weapon in his driveway. Peneha then took about five people into his home to recover from their distress. He was quoted by 9 News Australia as saying, “I saw dead people everywhere. There were three in the hallway, at the door leading into the mosque, and people inside the mosque.” Peneha said he was baffled by the attack, saying he had lived “next door to this mosque for about five years and the people are great, they’re very friendly, I just don’t understand it.” Police have taken four people into custody, including three men and one woman. None of the suspects were on a police watchlist. Police Commissioner Bush noted that a man in his late 20s has been charged with murder and will appear in Christchurch court tomorrow. Bush also asked all mosques in New Zealand to close their doors for safety reasons, urging “anyone who was thinking of going to a mosque anywhere in New Zealand today not to go. To close your doors until you hear from us again.” Christchurch, New Zealand’s second largest city, was also placed under lockdown initially. Police found multiple firearms at both locations, as well as two improvised explosive devices attached to a vehicle that were going to be detonated as part of the attack. Police successfully disabled one device, and authorities are still working on the other. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the shooting a well-planned terrorist attack in a press conference, saying the shooters had “extremist views” that have “no place in New Zealand or the world.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed one of the attackers was an Australian-born citizen, and described the man as an “extremist right-wing, violent terrorist.” Media reports identified the 28-year-old man as Brenton Tarrant.  The Australian man live-streamed the attack on Facebook for 17 minutes, and the footage shows a man walking into a mosque and opening fire. New Zealand authorities “strongly urge that the (video) link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.” On a now-deleted Twitter account, the attacker posted a 74-page manifesto, titled “The Great Replacement,” just before the attack. The right-wing extremist outlined his motives for the attack, saying he wanted to “create an atmosphere of fear” and to “incite violence” against Muslims.  He added he had been planning the attack for two years, but only picked Christchurch as the location three months ago. He wrote, “I only arrived to New Zealand to live temporarily whilst I planned and trained, but I soon found out that New Zealand was as target rich of an environment as anywhere else in the West.”  He also gave details about his upbringing in the manifesto, writing, “I am just a regular white man, from a regular family, who decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people.” “My parents are of Scottish, Irish and English stock. I had a regular childhood, without any great issues.” He went on to describe himself as an “ethno-nationalist” and a “fascist,” confirming, “Yes. It is a terrorist attack.”

Rabat – Casablanca will host its fourth Smart City Hackathon April 17-18, an event that Casablanca Events and Animations (CEA) is organizing in partnership with Hack and Pitch.  Animating the Moroccan startup world, this year’s hackathon will focus on the “smart city” concept to create an innovative program for urban development. Using artificial intelligence, teams will have to develop a prototype or an innovative computer program. The prototype should respond to at least one of three fundamental categories of urban development: Environmental remediation and sustainable development, making citizens feel safer in public spaces, and improving traffic. CEA noted that participants “will have at their disposal the premises of LaFactory, the ScreenDy platform and many tools.” They will also work with professional mentors who can assist with their projects. At the end, the teams will present their projects in front of a jury of experts in Casablanca. The winner in each of the three categories will receive a prize and get to go to a four-day bootcamp at LaFactory to accelerate their project. Winners can also apply for the “scalerator,” a LaFactory program, which gives the “most deserving” winners the benefit of Fond Inov Invest that has funding of MAD 200,000. The event will also offer companies an opportunity to meet students motivated to work on solving problems of the future. CEA’s goal is to develop a promotional strategy for Casablanca locally, regionally, and internationally through economic, cultural, and sporting events.

Rabat – The Moroccan ambassador to Australia and New Zealand, Karim Medrek, confirmed that none of the victims of two terror attacks against two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, were Moroccan. The attacks killed 49 people and injured at least 50 people, including children. The ambassador added that the Moroccan embassy is in constant contact with authorities in New Zealand to follow the situation of Moroccans living in Christchurch. International news outlets reported that the attacker is a 28-year-old Australian national named Brenton Tarrant. Before commiting the attack, the attacker also shared a manifesto to explain his goal. Describing himself as an “ordinary white man,” the attacker said he was inspired by Norway mass killer Anders Behring Breiving. The attacker documented the shooting through a live video on Facebook. One of the survivors of the shooting was a Moroccan Ph.D. student named Mussa Bouray who spoke about the attack with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Bouray said that he was parking his car when he arrived at the Al Nour mosque. “I saw a large number of worshipers rushing out of the mosque in all directions.” 1/9 Police continue to deal with what is an unprecedented event for New Zealand. The loss of life and the number of those who have been injured is tragic.
As the Prime Minister has stated, this has been designated a terrorist attack. — New Zealand Police (@nzpolice) March 15, 2019  Bouray said that he was with his wife, who had gotten out of the car to enter the mosque. His wife managed to hide in a building when she heard the sound of gunfire. The student said that it was a “real nightmare.” “The security services quickly spread into the mosque to block the suspect, who is said to be an Australian extremist,” said Bouray. Police in New Zealand said, “The loss of life and the number of those who have been injured is tragic. As the Prime Minister has stated, this has been designated a terrorist attack.”

Rabat – According to new data on arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on March 14, Morocco ranks 17th in the world for gun trafficking, and sixth in the MENA region. SIPRI stated that of the 75 percent of guns exported into the MENA region in the decade of 2009-2018, Algeria imported 50 percent. Morocco received 485 trafficked guns in 2017 and 387 in 2018, representing 15 percent of the guns trafficked into the MENA region in the two years.  Sub-Saharan countries received 25 percent of guns trafficked into Africa in the five years of 2014-2018. Compared to the previous five years, 2009-2013, exports to sub-Saharan Africa declined 45 percent. MENA region imports most of the world’s arms   According to the study, the ﬁve largest exporters of trafficked arms in 2014-2018, accounting for 75 percent of the trade, were the US, Russia, France, Germany, and China. Arms trafficking increased in the Middle East between 2009-2013 and 2014-2018, while there was a decrease in all other regions. Several MENA countries ranked as the highest importers of trafficked arms in the last decade. Saudi Arabia ranked second,, the UAE fifth, Algeria sixth, Egypt eighth, Iraq 12th, and Morocco 17th. The figures can only represent a fraction of the actual arms that are trafficked because trafficking is multidimensional. Firearms are manufactured and traded both legally and illicitly, making the tracing of illegally trafficked firearms complex. Since the Council of Arab Interior Ministers implemented a strategy during an official meeting in Tunisia in 2002, Morocco has played an important role in the fight against arms trafficking, especially in the Strait of Gibraltar and its coastal and land borders in the south. According to a Flemish Peace Institute study, violence and gun smuggling in Morocco are mostly connected to Polisario or ISIS. On Tuesday, March 12, a shooter opened fire on passersby in Guelmim, southern Morocco, killing one and injuring 11. The shooter was a middle-aged Dutch man using a licensed shotgun. As a result of the shooting, the Moroccan government is considering strict rules for hunters who apply for gun licenses. For those who already have a license, the government may require them to pass a physical and psychological test and a background check to find out if the person has terrorist links. Whether the government will investigate the manipulation of hunting licenses remains to be seen.

Rabat – Donald Trump has given in to mounting international pressure following the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crash, announcing the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 9 jets.  The decision came on Wednesday, March 13, following the tragic plane crash that killed all 157 passengers onboard. “Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice. The safety of the American people, and all people is our paramount concern,” president Trump stated. stating his confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX jets, Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg expressed his dissatisfaction on Monday, saying that this accident is a reminder of the leadership role the company assumes and their “enduring commitment to safety.” Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pointed out to the similarities between the Jakarta crash and that of Ethiopia, saying further investigations should be carried out to determine the causes of the crash and address it. He added, “tragedies like this affect the entire aerospace industry.” Morocco’s national flag carrier Royal Air Maroc, which received its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 in December and expected an additional two, also closed its airspace indefinitely to all the operations of all its Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft on March 11.  The Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302, which crashed only six minutes after it had taken off, killing all 157 passengers on board, including two Moroccans. El Hassan Sayouty, a researcher at Hassan II University in Casablanca and Chihab Ben Ahmed, a regional director for the environment of Morocco’s eastern Draa-Tafilalet region died in the crash. In a tweet, the Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani extended his most sincere condolences to Sayouty’s bereaved family.  The plane took to the air from the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia airport headed for Nairobi.  Due to the incident, the company’s revenue will likely decrease, as the company had planned to deliver 579 MAXs this year, amounting to $32 billion. China, which receives one-third of the companies deliveries, may also ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes. This is the second recent fatal plane crash involving the 737 MAX 8 jets. The first deadly crash, a Lion Air flight, occurred in October 2018. 189 passengers died in the crash. Marc Garneau, the Canadian minister of transport, explained that experts say the two plane crashes had things in common, noting “they exceeded the level of resemblance regarding the reasons of the Ethiopian crash.” Investigations carried out by the Canadian government into the Lion Air crash confirmed on an anonymous NASA database that the plane’s destabilizer system and Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCA) had been dysfunctional.

Rabat – The National Ports Agency (ANP) has just published a denial following information circulating online indicating that the sand on the beach of Imsouane, north of Agadir, has been plundered. “It is only a project to dredge the sand accumulated in the port of Imsouane. This work is carried out periodically to preserve the depth of the basins and quays of each port in order to guarantee the safety of navigation and improve the operating conditions of the vessels,” said the ANP. The ANP Regional Directorate in Agadir “has drawn up an action plan to improve the operating conditions of the port of Imsouane.” The plan, which also aims to ensure the safety of navigation, includes the dredging of accumulated sand, which is a danger to fishers.  “The sand extracted by this dredging is dumped into the sea to avoid it being plundered,” according to ANP. On March 13, the association Surfrider Foundation Morocco cited a source of the project team. “Mechanical shovels have been dredging the beach of Imsouane since December 12, 2018 in order to clear the access to the port… to improve the working conditions of fishers,” said the source. “The collected sand is deposited on the plateau north of Imsouane, a place called ‘la Cathedrale,’” added the source. Surfrider published a video on March 8 showing bulldozers carrying out sand extraction operations in Imsouane. Imsouane had until then been spared from “plundering operations widespread on other beaches.”  Called one of the world’s most beautiful beaches in 2017 by Forbes, Imsouane is a popular spot for surfers. They are “afraid that this dredging operation could change the wave that attracts up to 100,000 surfers each year,” reports the website Surfsession. Removing sand could “alter the break-up by making the wave flatter.” The need for sand in Morocco stood at 45 million tons in 2015 and 60 million tons in 2020, the Professional Sand Association (APS) estimated. The Littoral Act adopted in 2015 prohibits sand extraction from beaches and dunes. It also regulates any exemptions that may be granted. On 23 June 2015, the Chamber of Councillors passed the Littoral Bill. The law prohibits damage to the natural state of the sea shoreline.  This prohibition does not apply to port areas, sea defences or public interest installations. Created in 2010 in Agadir, the NGO Surfrider Foundation Maroc is a association for the protection, promotion and sustainable management of the coast, waves and its users. It is an affiliate of the Surfrider Foundation network.

Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to make a second official visit to Morocco in April. Maghreb Confidential reported that Macron will arrive in Morocco to inaugurate the new PSA Peugeot Citroen plant in Kenitra, a city north of Rabat, with King Mohammed VI. The company is one of the leading firms in the Moroccan market. Its new plant in Kenitra is setting a goal to produce 100,000 cars in 2019. The plant is also seeking to double its annual production capacity to 200,000 in 2020. PSA considered its plan in Kenitra as the “best performing of the industrial plants of PSA Group.” The company aims to produce both cars and their engines in Morocco. Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said in 2018: “Having both the vehicle and the engine made in Morocco makes it possible to have an integration rate of 80 percent.” The Kenitra automotive construction site opened in early 2017. By the end of 2017, PSA Group had a total workforce of 350 in Morocco. In addition to the automotive industry, Morocco also partnered with France to make the project of the high speed train, or LGV, possible. King Mohammed VI and Macron inaugurated the high speed train, called Al Boraq, in November 2018. Al Boraq reaches a top speed of about 320 kilometers per hour between Tangier and Kenitra. It drops its speed to 160 kilometers per hour from Kenitra to Casablanca. The French government offered loans for 51 percent of the €2 billion overall cost of the project.

Rabat – In a statement received by Morocco World News, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) announced  it found a common ground with the representatives of AMPL on March 12. The statement emphasized that the new agreement was approved by the majority of the pilots during a referendum held on Monday. The agreement seeks to ensure “social peace for the next three years as well as a salary upgrade of 5 percent effective from March 2019,” the statement read. It added, “The two parties welcome the conclusion of an agreement that represents a major step to mobilize all major forces to begin a phase of strategic development for the company in a calm and responsible social climate.” The agreement comes after months of internal crisis between RAM management and pilots over working conditions.  Between July and August 2018, disagreement between management and pilots hit its highest point when pilots boycotted flights, causing RAM significant losses in terms of customers and financial returns.  Pilots’ demonstrations resulted in the delay and cancelation of more than 12 flights a day for nearly one month. Among their demands, pilots asked for a pay raise and better working conditions, including extended paid holidays and better healthcare coverage. The pilots also called for the re-establishment of a school of aviation in Morocco after the closure of RAM’s training center for pilots in 2014. Prior to this agreement, RAM and AMPL announced that they had reached a deal in mid-August to end the crisis. The deal aimed to focus on recruitment to end the shortage of pilots. But pilots crapped that deal in September, saying that it did not meet most of their demands.

Rabat  – The US has denied a visa for the president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, to attend a FIFA Council meeting in Miami. The reasons the visa was denied to Ahmad are unknown. International media have been commenting that Malagasy citizens are not routinely prohibited from traveling to the US as citizens of banned countries.  The visa denial seems unusual for a high ranking individual like the CAF president attending an important FIFA meeting. It is unclear whether Ahmad will successfully appeal the decision in time to attend the meeting or if immigration authorities will reverse the decision. The FIFA Council meeting will take place Friday, March 15, in Miami, Florida. FIFA leaders are heading to Miami to discuss a possible expansion of the number of teams participating in the 2022 World Cup, from 32 teams to 48 teams. Previous World Cups included 32 teams, but the 2026 World Cup in the US, Mexico, and Canada will be expanded to 48 teams.

Rabat –  The US State Department has released a human rights report for 2018 providing an overview about how Morocco deals with the travel documents of Sahrawis. The report recalled Morocco’s efforts to encourage Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps in Algeria and elsewhere to return to Morocco “if they acknowledged the government’s” sovereignty over its southern provinces. According to the report, freedom of movement in Morocco is generally respected. The government, however, limited movement for areas experiencing widespread unrest, said the report. “The government continued to make travel documents available to Sahrawis, and there were no reported cases of authorities preventing Sahrawis from traveling. The US State Department also gave an overall summary of the situation in Western Sahara, in southern Morocco, in a separate report. In the section about freedom of movement, the report said that activists alleged that “Moroccan authorities sometimes restricted access to Western Sahara for foreign visitors, including journalists and human rights defenders.” Traditionally, the Moroccan government restricts access to the region for visitors “when such visits challenged Morocco’s territorial integrity or were perceived to be a threat to internal security and stability.” The government granted access to 13,844 foreigners traveling to Laayoune in the first eight months of 2018. There are some cases when the government prevented visitors from accessing the region or deported them due to possible threats. One of the most recent cases was when Morocco expelled two Spanish pro-Polisario activists in Laayoune who claimed that they were there for New Year’s Eve. Authorities found that the activists were staying at the house of Hassana Alia, who is living in exile in Spain. The separatist was sentenced to life in prison in absentia by a Rabat military court in 2013 for his involvement in the Gdeim Izik incident. The incident dates back to 2010 when clashes between Sahrawis and Moroccan police erupted, resulting in the death of 11 Moroccan officers and the injury of 70 others, including four civilians, as well as great property damage. The report on Morocco’s human rights performance mentioned the Gdeim Izik incident.  The report said that some NGOs believe that the group of 24 Sahrawis convicted for involvement in the killing of the 11 officers are “political prisoners.” However, Morocco’s he National Council on Human Rights (CNDH) published a report on the 2017 hearings, which said that the convicts had a fair trial as provided in Morocco’s Constitution and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Rabat – Mercer, an American consulting firm, has released its list ranking the quality of life for working expatriates in 231 cities. Rabat ranked at 117th on the list, and Casablanca came in close behind at 124th. Morocco’s capital came just after Rio De Janeiro in Brazil and before Sofia in Bulgaria. The New York-based firm takes into account factors such as the sociocultural environment, housing, public services, and education when assessing cities.  Vienna, Austria, came in first place for the 10th year in a row, followed by Zurich, Switzerland, and Vancouver, Canada. Port Louis in Mauritius was the highest-ranked African city, coming in at 83rd place. Three South African cities came next, with Durban at 88th, Cape Town at 95th, and Johannesburg at 96th. Algiers ranked at 185th, next to Nairobi at 186th. Rabat has gone down a ranking in the list for two years in a row now, as it came in at 115th in 2017 and 116th in 2018. Casablanca, however, has gained a rank in the past two years.

Rabat – Promising footballer Mohammed Ihattaren, born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents, faces the difficult choice of choosing between the Netherlands’ national football team or Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Having started his professional career with Dutch side PSV Eindhoven and quickly established himself as “one of Netherlands biggest talents,” Football Oranje reported recently, the 17-year-old Ihattaren is currently the center of “a tug of war” between the Atlas Lions and the Netherlands’ Oranje. For both teams, the young player could bring dividends to their dreams of prospective glory. Ihattaren, who currently plays for the Dutch under-19 team, can still choose to switch to Morocco for his senior international career. According to numerous reports from Moroccan sources, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) hopes to convince him to opt for Morocco. FRMF’s “mission” is to compel Ihattaren to be part of the dream team competing at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) in June. Depending on their political affiliations, Dutch media outlets frame the issue from different angles. More liberal-leaning observers often query about whether the problem is with the Dutch football team or society. Questions of allegiance are bound to be raised and fingers pointed at Ihattaren’s potential “disloyalty” to his country of birth. The underlying assumption of such considerations generally has to do with the waning glory of the Dutch national squad. Maybe after all, playing for the Oranje, as the Dutch team is called, is no longer as compelling as it once was, when the Netherlands graciously and confidently swaggered through the footballing world. Not long ago, the Oranje could take on the world’s reigning champions and make them look like amateurs. Liberal outlets sometimes note the discomfiting looks and phrases that Dutch players of migrant background encounter on a daily basis. The discomfort tends to influence their career-defining choices. In more right-leaning networks, meantime, questions are bound to be raised of the degree of nationalist or patriotic attachment from “those children of immigrants” who, after reaping all the benefits the Netherlands had to offer, such as education and state-of-the-art sporting facilities, end up opting for their country of origin. Patriotism is questioned, multiculturalism caricatured, and questions asked as to why the country should keep investing in people of doubtful commitment. People, elated and angry right-wing critics often point out of these players, whose hearts beat for places miles away from the Dutch academies where they spent their formative years. While it is unclear which side Ihattaren will pledge allegiance to, choosing Morocco would not be as much of a surprise as it would years ago when elite players were more interested in career advancement than in identity or belonging. Increasingly, choosing origin countries over birth countries has become a routine, a rapid reversal of situations as more Moroccans with dual nationality in Europe feel some missing links in their sense of attachment and belonging. “The Netherlands I love you; Italy I love you; America I love you; Porto Rico I love you. But I love Morocco the most,” heavyweight legend Badr Hari shouted after securing a major victory in March 2018. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the Atlas Lions’ lineup featured 17 foreign-born players, including 5 Dutch-born. Reporting on FRMF’s successful campaign in winning the hearts of foreign-born Moroccan talents, the New York Times dismissively wrote that Morocco’s team was essentially an “imported” squad. The country’s recent successes on the pitch, which some commentators have likened to a renaissance, boil down to the contribution of “players born outside the country and forged in the academies of clubs and national associations scattered across Europe,” according to the Times’ report. For the Russian World Cup, Morocco’s Dutch importees notably included Hakim Ziyech; Noussair Mazraoui; and the Amrabat brothers, Nordin and Sofyan. As an increasing number of Moroccans switch their allegiance in favor of the Atlas Lions, Moroccan Netherlands-residing columnist Fouad Laroui remarked recently, the Dutch are surprised and “keep asking ‘but why?’” Laroui gave the example of Mazraoui, who in 2018 faced a forest of questions from the Dutch media demanding that he justify his decision to choose Morocco over the Netherlands. Mazraoui declined to pick sides, saying he felt attached to both countries. Upon insistence from interviewers, however, the Ajax player said, “I really like the Netherlands. But since it appears I have to choose, I would go with Morocco.” Reaction to populism Beneath the simple-looking move of opting for Morocco, Ihattaren, Ziyech, Mazraoui, the Amrabats, and all foreign-born choosing their origin countries constitute in large part a reaction to a growing pattern: Surging populism and the tense debate about identity and patriotism in a number of Western countries. Even the Times’ article conceded, albeit marginally, that Europe’s resurgent nativism and nationalism is driving many children of migrants to question their countries’ comfort with having them around. On the streets, on public transport, and even in stadiums while watching or playing matches, they are constantly reminded that they do not really belong there and that their religious and cultural way of life is not welcome. When times are rough and the goals are not coming for national teams, players from minority backgrounds take the brunt of the criticism. The racism and Islamophobia-saturated breakup between Mesut Ozil and German football after Germany’s 2018 World Cup fiasco is a textbook example. In the blink of an eye, the majority of German fans and footballing authorities forgot that Ozil, whose parents came from Turkey, was one of the most defining faces of Germany’s dominance in the world of football in 2014. After winning the World Cup in July 2018, France’s Africans and Arabs-filled team was celebrated and given the highest of French national accolades. Many French were quick to opine that the success of Les Bleus, as the team is nicknamed, spoke volumes about France’s successful integration model. But that World Cup euphoria stood in stark contrast with Les Bleus’ World Cup fiasco in South Africa in 2010. Reacting to a poor performance from Les Bleus in 2010, rightwing philosopher Alain Finkielkraut went as far as suggesting that the players, in majority of migrant backgrounds, were “arrogant and unintelligent thieves with mafia morals.” In origin countries, meanwhile, players feel valued, celebrated, and welcome. Their mistakes are forgotten, or at least tolerated, because no one questions which country their hearts beat for. In Russia, Morocco lost its first match against Iran. Many had predicted an easy win for the Moroccan Lions. But the game’s only goal was a last-minute own goal by Moroccan striker Aziz Bouhaddouz. After the game, Bouhaddouz’s error was marginally discussed in the Moroccan media. In fact, rather than humiliate the visibly distraught player, Moroccan fans sent supportive messages. “Mistakes happen to everyone. We are proud of you,” a number of Moroccans wrote. Such occurrences increase the connection and deep emotional attachment that players already felt. Families also help in making the difficult choice as parents often dream of seeing their children play for their origin countries. However, the underlying politics of shifting allegiances, in the minds of many elite players, comes down to the daily reminders that identity matters. “I think with the heart, and the heart was for Morocco,” the New York Times quoted winger Mimoun Mahi explaining his decision to ditch Oranje for Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Ahead of a continental trophy that Moroccans dream of lifting after decades of underwhelming continental displays, many Moroccan fans and footballing authorities hope that Ihattaren and other talents will, too, listen to their hearts.

Rabat – The US State Department has issued its annual report on Morocco’s Human Rights Practices for 2018, summarizing both positive and negative performances in human rights in Morocco. The report includes seven sections: Integrity of the person, civil liberties, freedom to participate in politics, corruption, investigation of human rights abuses, societal abuses, and worker rights. Morocco faces challenges with regard to freedom of speech and the press, corruption, migration, sexual assault, and child labor, according to the report.  While corruption is punishable, the government “did not implement the law effectively.” The report said that “there were reports of government corruption in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches during the year.” The report noted that there is an imbalance in dealing with corruption to “reduce its occurence.” Quoting the Ministry of Justice, the report said that 134 public officials faced corruption charges in 2018, but only 13 were convicted and 121 investigated. The 2018 World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index ranked Morocco 70th in the world for absence of corruption, dropping from 59th place the previous year. Despite the low ranking, Morocco’s anti-corruption performance has steadily improved compared to previous years. The improvement is largely due to the adoption of the access to information law in February 2018. The passing of the law enabled Moroccan citizens to file complaints if they were denied transparency or access to information. While the law was only implemented this week, public administrations have a full year before they are required to answer information requests. Women anti-discrimination law lacks clarity Like many observers and feminists, the report also noted the loopholes in Law 103-13 against gender discrimination implemented on September 12, 2018. The report also acknowledged that an act such as spousal rape is still “not a crime.” It also remarked that the “impact of the new law was not yet clear by year’s end.” Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) said in its latest report that young Moroccan women still experience violence. Sixty-three percent of women had experienced violence in 2009. Law 103-13 Eliminating Violence Against Women criminalizes sexual harassment and assault in public spaces as well as cybercrime. “The law does not specifically define domestic violence against women and minors, but the general prohibitions of the criminal code address such violence,” according to the department’s report. Child marriage, child abuse still exist While the report did not provide statistics for child abuse, exploitation, and marriage, it mentioned briefly the challenges facing children in Morocco. The department took notes from reports from human rights NGOs and media, which claim widespread child abuse in Morocco. “Prosecutions were extremely rare,” the human rights report commented. Morocco has a high rate of underage marriage. The report noted that “parents, with the informed consent of the minor, may secure a waiver from a judge for underage marriage.” In addition, “The judiciary approved the vast majority of petitions for underage marriage.” In Morocco the legal age for marriage is 18. However, HCP shared worrisome information about child marriage, especially in rural areas. HCP estimated that45,789 Moroccan girls 18 and under are married. “The girls remain the majority of the victims of child marriage, representing 94.8 percent (45,786 girls) of married minors,” warned the report. Freedom of speech, internet, and peaceful assembly In the section about freedom of expression, the State Department provided background about the popular Hirak movement in the Al Hoceima province, in which hundreds of people were arrested in 2016-2017. The protests  condemned social disparities in the region.  In reference to the Hirak, the report recalled that the government prosecuted a defense lawyer for Hirak protesters, Abdessadek Bouchtaoui. Bouchtaoui received a 20-month prison sentence and an MAD 500 fine for insulting officials and representatives of authority while on duty. He was also prosecuted for inciting people on Facebook to participate in unauthorized protests. For freedom of peaceful assembly, the report recalled the sentences given to 53 members of the Hirak, including Nasser Zefzafi, who is facing a sentence of 20 years in prison. According to the Moroccan  Ministry of Justice, security services arrested 578 persons in crimes related to the Hirak protests, “of whom 306 were sentenced, 204 pardoned, 39 acquitted of all charges, and 29 were awaiting trial as of November,” said the report.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to cooperate in the supervision of banks based in Morocco and Dubai. The two bodies signed the MoU on Wednesday, March 13, in Rabat. The agreement highlights Bank Al-Maghrib’s commitment to developing the highest governance standards in Moroccan banks and supervising their activities overseas, including within international financial hubs such as Dubai, said BAM in a statement. The MoU will cover, in particular, the efficiency of regulatory tools for banks having mutual interests in Morocco and Dubai. The agreement would help bolster investors’ confidence and promote bilateral financial services. Under the MoU, Bank Al-Maghrib and the DFSA will share all information regarding authorization applications made by banks established in both jurisdictions.  The exchange will also concern information on the financial strength of credit institutions as well as the points identified in reports and during supervision visits. Representatives of the two authorities will hold ad-hoc meetings to address supervisory issues relating to cross-border institutions based in both jurisdictions. BAM and DFSA will also work jointly to identify possible financial offenses related, in particular, to unauthorized banking services, money laundering, and any other breach of regulatory requirements.

Rabat – The minister of tourism, air transport, handicrafts, and social economy, Mohamed Sajid, has finally convinced Morocco’s governing council to pass a bill to regulate handicrafts in Morocco. The handicraft industry employs almost 2.3 million people in Morocco, making up 20 percent of the labor force. The trade contributes 7 percent of Morocco’s GDP. The craft sector has long existed without a modern legal framework. Sajid and other politicians attribute the sector’s disorganization and perceived loss in quality to the lack of such a framework.  The new bill aims to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework of the sector. It also allows craftsmen to benefit from the pension system and mandatory health insurance (AMO). Sajid hopes to implement the bill as quickly as possible. Most significantly, it creates a single national register of artisans which would exist on a government-created website. The single register would facilitate registration and collect data regarding the handicraft sector. The bill would require all artisans, cooperatives, or companies to register with the national database. Each practicing artisan who registers will receive professional identification. To receive an identification card, they must submit a diploma from a training institute or a certificate from the provincial professional body which represents that artisan’s trade.  The bill proposes the formation of professional blocs on the local, provincial, regional, and national levels. Such bodies would exist for each trade. The groups would intend to act as partners in local development by improving relationships with local vendors and more effectively collecting information.  The bill would also reorganize the National Council of Crafts to help it better act as an advisory institution which could work in the interest of the handicraft industry. The council would work to guarantee safety and health criteria as well as building the capacity of artisans to meet challenges posed by foreign markets.  Public administration and institutions will be strongly encouraged to give craft products priority in their purchasing operations. The new law seeks to improve collaboration and organization among various actors within the handicraft industry as well as with the government.

Rabat – The Spanish civil guard have arrested a 35-year-old woman who was carrying five dead animals in her suitcase, according to the Spanish news agency EFE. She was carrying four porcupines and one pangolin. The pangolin is the world’s most trafficked animal according to Science Mag. The Spanish police found the animals while screening the luggage of passengers on a flight from Casablanca. The woman is originally from Equatorial Guinea. Border control agents asked the woman to take her suitcase through one of the control scanners, reported EFE. The agents noticed a “strange shape in the image and decided to open the suitcase.” They found five dead animals “hidden among the passenger’s clothes, without any documentation.”  The Spanish police said the woman may have wanted to transport the species for food because “in some countries, pangolin meat is considered exquisite.” Spain arrested the woman for “illegal trafficking in protected species” but later released her. Porcupines, unlike pangolins, are not listed as an endangered species. The pangolin however, is critically endangered and is listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The pangolin is the only mammal that has protective keratin scales on earth.  International law has prohibited the pangolin trade since 2000, but is popular for its meat and “medicinal virtues,” according to French newspaper le Monde. The insect-eater is one of the most sought-after specified by traffickers in Asia. The pangolin is credited with powers to “cure diseases such as asthma and some cancers or to increase male virility.” The animal is so sought after that one pangolin can earn up to $1,000 on the black market. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project on March 11 said that members of the Chinese Congress made a proposal “to ban the use of pangolin products in traditional Chinese medicine.”

Rabat – Ilan Berman, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council, has explored Morocco’s strategies in dealing with repatriated Islamic radicals and the “major concern” they pose for the country. In his analysis, Berman emphasized Morocco’s dual approach to the problem of radical returnees: “Isolation and rehabilitation.” Morocco is aware that imprisonment does not always solve problems, especially not ones related to Islamic radicals and their dangerous ideology. For this, the country has sought to use restorative justice for terrorist offenders who can still be rehabilitated.  One example of the country’s new approach in criminal justice is the musalaha (reconciliation) program focusing on the rehabilitation of terrorist offenders, the participation of the victim and the reconciliation of both parties. It is also a reconciliation with “the offender’s religion, Islam, and society as a whole,” said Berman.  In addition, Morocco has established a prison system that separates Islamic extremists from other “ordinary” criminals to prevent their radical ideologies from affecting other prisoners. Between 16 and 17 prisons house terrorist prisoners. They are classified in three categories: Religious extremists, terrorist financiers, and those specialized in ideological mobilization.  Berman notes that prisoners who were involved in influencing and mobilizing people to adopt radical ideologies are the most dangerous of the three.   Moroccan prisons currently house 800 Islamic radicals. “In this way, officials in Rabat hope to ‘quarantine’ extremists and stop their ideas from infecting those convicted of other crimes,” according to Berman. There are more than 1,600 Moroccan jihadists fighting with extremists in the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq, according to the 2017 estimates of the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior. In 2015, Morocco officially made mobilization to join ISIS a crime under the counter-terrorism provisions of the Penal Code, announcing a new security service, the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ). The country’s security bodies, the BCIJ, the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN), and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) all collaborate in fighting terrorism. Ever since 2015, Morocco’s crackdown on terrorist cells and terrorist financiers has increased and strengthened both nationally and internationally. The country cooperates with international intelligence agencies, often assisting Spain in tracking terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad. Whether Morocco’s approach succeeds in dealing with the threats of terrorism and jihad returnees remains to be seen. Successes in the field of counter-terrorism, however, is a “valuable lesson for other regional countries that have the same problem,” Berman concludes. On Sunday, March 10, Morocco repatriated, “on humanitarian grounds,” eight Moroccans involved in terrorism in Syria. The decision was part of the Moroccan authorities’ contributions to international efforts to fight terrorism. For its part, the US State Department expressed appreciation for Morocco’s decision, which it described as the “best solution to prevent” terrorists from returning to the battlefield. “Morocco is a highly capable partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and we appreciate its commitment to countering terrorism,” the US Department stated.

Rabat – Tehran’s Revolutionary Court has sentenced Iranian prominent lawyer and human rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes after two trials. Sotoudeh had been serving a 5-year sentence after being convicted on June 13, 2018. After another trial, the court sentenced her to a total of 38 years and 148 lashes. Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said “Sotoudeh’s sentence is a threat aimed at every human rights advocate in Iran to stop defending human rights.” Quoting Sotoudeh’s lawyer Mohammad Moghimi, Human Rights Watch stated that Sotoudeh was sent to prison on charges of assembly and collusion against national security, propaganda against the state, and her membership in the Defenders of Human Rights Center, the Legam group campaigning for the abolition of the death penalty, and the National Peace Council.  The court also convicted Sotoudeh of encouraging corruption and prostitution, appearing at the judiciary without Islamic hijab, disturbing public peace and order, and publishing falsehoods with the intent to disturb public opinion. Human Rights Watch said the sentence was “draconian,” describing it as “an appalling travesty of justice.”  “This is the harshest sentence Amnesty International has documented against a human rights defender in Iran in recent years” said Amnesty International’s campaigns manager Kristyan Benedict. The Iranian government also arrested Sotoudeh in 2010 on allegations of spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security. She spent three years in prison and was released in 2013. According to Amnesty International, Iran has tightened its grip on outspoken human rights activists, including political dissidents, journalists, online media workers, students, filmmakers, musicians and writers, and minority rights and environmental activists. Amnesty launched an online petition under the title “Free Nasrin Sotoudeh now,” calling on the international community to pressure Iran into releasing Sotoudeh after “after two grossly unfair trials.”

Rabat – Qatar Petroleum said Wednesday that it has acquired stake in the Tarfaya Offshore Shallow Petroleum Agreement, Italian supermajor Eni’s exploration project off Morocco’s Atlantic coast. Eni signed the Tarfaya agreement with Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) in 2017. The deal has allowed the company to pursue exploration projects across 23,900 square kilometers of the waters along the cities of Sidi Ifni, Tan Tan, and Tarfaya, an area south of Agadir and north of Laayoune. Eni says there is high potential for natural gas and crude oil in the area.  Now the state-owned Qatar Petroleum company, the third largest oil company in the world, will take on a 30 percent participating interest in the project, consisting of 12 neighboring exploration blocks. That leaves Eni with 45 percent participating interest and ONHYM with 25 percent. The deal is contingent on approval from Moroccan regulators. Earlier this week, Qatar Petroleum announced it was acquiring an exploration block in Mozambique. The additional expansion into Moroccan waters illustrates the company’s push into frontier basins, areas where oil and gas resources remain mostly undiscovered. “This agreement represents another important milestone in our partnership roadmap with Eni, and further strengthens our distinguished long term relationship with the Kingdom of Morocco,” said Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the CEO of Qatar Petroleum. Qatar Petroleum signed a 2016 deal with Chevron to prospect for deepwater oil in Morocco, but both companies abandoned the project last year. This week’s announcement makes it clear that the company has not given up on oil in Morocco. The Tarfaya project drew scrutiny in 2017 from the Canary Islands for its proximity to its territory. Morocco has since reassured Spanish officials that Eni’s project will not impact tourism in the area.

Rabat – Lieutenant General Abdelfattah Louarak, the inspector general of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR), has announced tenders for four contracts worth an estimated MAD 91.3 million to acquire new military uniforms, reported Maghreb Intelligence on March 9. FAR will award one contract for camouflage combat clothing (MAD 22.5 million). The second is for camouflage parkas (MAD 42.4 million). The third is for embroidery (MAD 22.5 million). The fourth contract is for new belts (MAD 3.9 million). FAR will award the contracts on April 18.  The army will get its new look just in time to match its new recruits. In February, King Mohammed VI asked the government to recruit 10,000 Moroccans into obligatory military service, beginning in September 2019. The newly established compulsory military service is expected to cost Morocco MAD 500 million annually. The Moroccan government approved two decrees to implement the law on obligatory military service in January. The military service is expected to start in September. The FAR has seen several revamps since General Louarak took office. In January, Louarak appointed new military officials to high-level military positions in Morocco’s southern provinces. The general had sacked some officers and sent others into retirement in 2018 over “misconduct,” according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. Also in January, Middle East Monitor reported that Louarak instructed the military to modernize “its technological and counter-espionage capabilities.” King Mohammed VI appointed Louarak as inspector general of FAR in January 2017. The same month, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) boss Abdellatif Hammouchi changed the uniforms of DGSN staff as part of a strategy to modernize the police. The new service uniform included a metal badge on the chest to indicate the identity and number of the security agent.

Rabat – Although Adnan Asif Parveen had a green card work permit application pending that allowed him to work legally in the US, American border police detained him for a week at a patrol checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas, on January 11. According to the Independent, Asif is a Pakistani immigrant who applied for a green card two years ago after he married an American woman, Jennifer Asif.  Asif is currently being detained at Port Isabel Detention Center in South Texas. The government denied his green card application on February 28, citing “significant adverse factors that show discretion should not be exercised in your favour,” according to a letter from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. While border control held Asif in custody in January for a week, Asif claims, police served him pork sandwiches. Since they served him nothing else, Asif said he ate the bread after removing the meat. Eating pork is forbidden in Islam. Asif stated that during the interrogation, two Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) police persisted in asking questions about whether he had ties to terrorism. Asif’s lawyer, Cathy Potter, asserted that the government rejected the green card application because Asif is a Muslim.  The allegation caused US Congresswoman Grace Meng to write a letter to the Department of Homeland Security to inquire about Asif’s case. When Huffpost questioned Jennifer Asif about Potter’s accusations, she replied, “I feel like it’s simply because he’s Muslim … All we have tried to do is be a family and be legal. Every step of the way has been completely complicated. It’s hard not to be discouraged.” Asif’s lawyer filed a lawsuit in federal court after the government denied the application, but Asif faces possible deportation.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled a six-member terror cell on Thursday morning in several cities around the Casablanca area, including Mohammedia, just east of Casablanca; El Jadida, 100 kilometers west of Casablanca on the Atlantic coast; Sidi Bennour, 80 kilometers inland from El Jadida; and Marrakech. A statement from the Ministry of the Interior announced that BCIJ carried out the arrest in collaboration with the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The ministry said that the six radicalized suspects were aged 27 to 40. One of the suspects had spent time in prison after police arrested him for having links with ISIS terrorists active in Libya. A preliminary investigation found the suspect had pledged allegiance to ISIS. The ministry added that the suspect was plotting terror attacks across Morocco. Police placed all suspects into custody for further investigations. The operation followed the dismantling of a five-member terror cell in February in Safi, western Morocco.The suspects were aged 21-36. Morocco’s security services have arrested several alleged terrorists since the beginning of the year, including 13 in January. The head of the BCIJ, Abdelhak El Khiame, shared some statistics in December 2018 in the wake of the Imlil murders, in which two Scandinavian tourists were murdered near Mount Toubkal. Khiame estimated that 1,668 Moroccans had joined ISIS and other terror groups in Syria and other conflict zones. Last Sunday, Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior announced the repatriation of eight Moroccan fighters from Syria. The ministry described the operation as a “humanitarian” move which would allow the Moroccans to return in safety. The move pleased the US, one of Morocco’s major partners in counterterrorism. Morocco “is a highly capable partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS,” the US State Department said.  Following the 2003 terror attacks in Casablanca and the 2011 attack in Marrakech, the Moroccan security services announced several approaches to deal with terrorism. One of the programs implemented by the Moroccan government is the “moussalaha” program, or reconciliation. Launched in 2018, the project aims to reintegrate prisoners charged with terrorism. The program involves human rights and anti-radicalization experts to provide psychological assistance to people convicted of terror crimes.

Rabat – Contractual and Cell 9 teachers have pledged not to stop their protests while marching together in demand of reforms to how contractual teachers are paid. Together the two organizations have formed the Coordination for National Union Coordinations, which brings together the different unions, federations, and groups that have been protesting the current payment structure for some teachers since February. The Cell 9 coordination, which references a prison cell, the government’s ninth pay grade, and is a pun on the famous Moroccan book “Tazmamart Cell 10,” consists of the Democratic Labor Confederation’s National Education Union (SNE-CDT), the Democratic Labor Federation’s National Education Union (SNE-FDT), and the National Teaching Federation (FNE). The teachers are members of the government’s ninth pay grade. Many feel they are long overdue for a promotion to the 10th. The average difference between the two grades is MAD 1,500 per month, and according to the Ministry of Education, there are more than 4,560 teachers within the ninth pay grade. “We are forced to stay in this stage, some of us for decades,” Mohammed Boukhisse, a national coordinator for Cell 9, told Morocco World News. “By doing this the government never needs to increase our pay or benefits.” Through Facebook, Whatsapp, and weekend meetings, Cell 9 coordinated this week’s demonstrations with the organizations leading the contractual teachers’ strikes—the National Federation of Teachers (UMNT) and the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers Forced into Teaching Contracts (CNPCC). “They have been supporting us through all of our fights, so we decided to support them and at the same time promote our own issues,” Khalid Bittaouia, a member of the national CNPCC who worked with Cell 9 to plan the march, told MWN. The contractual teachers are protesting the government’s refusal to admit them as public sector employees, which would allow them to have longer term contracts, health care, and pension plans. “We have made this coordination between all of our groups so that we can force the Ministry of Education to discuss our problems and solve them,” Boukhisse said. The combined group hosted the first of its four-day mobilization campaigns on Tuesday, with a march beginning outside the headquarters of the Human Resources Department of the Ministry of Education and ending by Parliament. “We are going to continue our protesting until we get our rights and the ministry agrees to work with us and address our problems seriously,” Boukhisse said. “This is just the start. There will be more teachers in the future.” The group is scheduling country-wide protests over the next several weeks in an effort to continue putting pressure on the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education declined to comment on the protests. Since February, demonstrations have been held in several cities across Morocco, including Kenitra, Casablanca, Tetouan, Oujda, Errachidia, and Marrakech.  On March 10, following a six-day sit-in ending on International Women’s Day, the Ministry of Education released an announcement stating that it would abolish the fixed term contractual employments. In the statement, the ministry proposed to hire teachers permanently within the regional academies where they work. It was a concession the teachers were not willing to make. Latifa Aitali, a high school teacher and national coordinator for the CNPCC, was vocal about her rejection of the proposed changes—believing the changes will just bury the issues under new laws. As Aitali marched with her colleagues, she showed off her T-Shirt, which she said perfectly summarized her opinion on the current system and the ministry’s proposed changes. On the back of her shirt was painted the phrase, “We’ve got 99 problems and the unfair contract caused them all,” a reference to the early-2000s hit “99 Problems” by American artist Jay-Z. “All teachers in Morocco have problems, that’s why we are protesting together as one,” Aitali said. Teacher groups have called for continued strikes throughout this week and next week and plan to host another demonstration in Rabat this weekend.

Rabat – On the 6th anniversary of Pope Francis’ election, King Mohammed VI sent a congratulatory message. The letter, published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), includes the King’s wishes for “good health, happiness and greater success in his noble mission to spread human values.” The King continued the letter by reaffirming the privileged relations, strong friendship, and mutual esteem between Morocco and the Vatican City. He also expressed his determination to continue working with Pope Francis in efforts to uphold “noble religious and spiritual values shared by humanity, values that promote peace, tolerance and coexistence and reject all forms of ignorance, hate and extremism.” Pope Francis will visit Morocco March 30-31 and will celebrate mass in Rabat. During the pope’s time in Rabat, the King will welcome him at the Royal Palace. Pope Francis will also visit the Caritas social center and see the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams. On Sunday, the pope will host a mass at the Moulay Abdellah Sports Stadium. In his letter, the King mentioned the pope’s upcoming visit to Morocco and expressed hope that it would be an opportunity to exchange views, consolidate communication, promote interfaith understanding, and create intercultural dialogue. Argentinian Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected to the papacy March 13, 2013, following the resignation of the previous pope, Pope Benedict XVI. Now 82 years old, Pope Francis is the first pope from the Americas, the first Jesuit pope, and the first pope to adopt the name of Saint Francis of Assisi.

We are honored that OCP has selected our design for their new plant. With our leading technologies providing benefits such as safety, high reliability and enhanced heat recovery we are happy to help OCP reach their sustainability targets,” said Kalle Harkki.

Rabat – The Arab Development Council for Women and Business has decided to strip Moroccan poet Bouchrail Echchaoui of an award after she visited Israel. Moroccan and Lebanese activists criticized Echchaoui for the visit and urged the council to strip the poet of an award she received during ceremony on Sunday.  In response, the council issued a statement on Tuesday to announce its decision to strip the Moroccan poet of her award. “The council decided to withdraw the honorary award from [Echchaoui ], adhering to its national and Arab affiliation, and in the interest of its reputation and the reputation of the rest of the honorees of the Arab women and all the participants of the ceremony,” read part of the statement. The council said that it was surprised over the false accusations it received because it had no information about Echchaoui ’s visit to Israel. The council also recalled that Echchaoui  entered Lebanon more than once and was honored by the Arab Women Organization in 2018 at a ceremony at the headquarters of the League of Arab States. The statement added that the poet received the honor after votes from “Moroccans themselves.” The council reaffirmed its support for all Arab issues, especially the Palestinian cause, emphasizing that it is a prominent opponent of  normalization with Israel. The Moroccan Observatory Against Normalization issued a statement criticizing the council’s argument. In the statement, the observatory argued that the Moroccan poet is not a human rights activist as she claims. The observatory also criticized the council, emphasizing that its argument about the vote is “baseless and unreliable as there is no news confirming that a vote was held” to honor Moroccan women candidates in Beirut. The Moroccan observatory has been holding a national campaign, warning the government against any normalization with Israel. In the last two months, rumors spread widely that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to visit Morocco. The Moroccan government has declined to comment on the rumors twice. Following the speculation, dozens of activists went to Parliament to protest against the normalization of relations with Israel in  February in Rabat.

Rabat – The Moroccans who recently got off the waiting list and onto the selected list to perform Hajj in 2019 must pay their hajj pilgrimage fees on March 25 or 26 at Al Barid Bank agencies across the country, the Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs has announced. After some potential pilgrims won the hajj lottery in its first phase failed to pay the fees between February 18 and March 1, the ministry replaced awarded their places to Moroccans on the waiting list. This second phase of selected pilgrims must now pay the fees or be bumped off the list as well. The cost of the Hajj is set at MAD 49,906, but does not include pilgrims’ pocket money. The ministry usually encourages Moroccans to carry MAD 15,000 for personal expenses. The hajj fees cover pilgrims’ airplane tickets, food, accommodation in Medina and Mecca, transportation within Saudi Arabia, luggage fees, vaccinations, and the 5 percent tax Saudi Arabia imposes. To avoid a repeat of last year’s discomfort which Moroccan pilgrims suffered on hajj, the Islamic affairs minister, Ahmed Taoufiq, visited Mecca in December to discuss preparations for the 2019 hajj season. The minister met with heads of delegations to prepare to provide the best services to allow pilgrims to perform their rituals in comfort. The 2018 hajj season did not go smoothly for Moroccans. Many, including elderly people, struggled in Mecca due to lack of management, transport, shelter, and healthy meals. Several Moroccans also said that they had missed major hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil,” because there were “no delegates or coordinators” to guide them.

Rabat – The government is dismantling desert camps in the Erg Chebbi dunes of the Sahara, 40 kilometers from the city of Merzouga in eastern Morocco. The local government hired workers to help dismantle tourist camps in the Merzouga region, according to a Morocco World News source. The government allegedly tore down approximately 12 camps last weekend, and the told the rest to vacate the area or be forcibly removed. One luxury desert camp received notice that it must close but with no details of when or why, the owner told MWN. The camp has bookings until late 2020, which raises the question of what will happen to the guests who have booked or the camp owners with finances at stake.  The camp owner argued that the camps do good for the area and Morocco as a whole. Her business, she said, had “viguroulsy (sic) promoted Morocco, and specially Merzouga.” She asserted her company had “spent over 3 million dirhams in developing the camp and promoting Morocco.”   Those who have most at stake if the desert camps are shut down are the locals. Thousands of tourists visit the desert camps each year to experience Saharan sand dunes and provide the main source of local employment.  The camp owner MWN spoke to said they “source food locally and employ mostly local staff from the area,” which consists of a team of “42 workers, plus 3 other (sic) at the office.” Cameleers, food suppliers, and tour operators are also going to be affected. It is of no question that the desert camps help the area economically, so why are they being shut down? Although no official answer has been given yet, either to the media or camp owners, it may be for environmental or security reasons. Concerns have been raised regarding waste and sewage disposal and water usage by the dozens of desert camps in the area. There is allegedly no differentiation being made by the authorities between the camps that are registered and environmentally conscious and those that are unlicensed, “squatting” on the land and damaging the environment. Will all the camps in Erg Chebbi be given notice that they must close or do authorities have some kind of criteria to allow some camps to stay? The luxury camp owner told MWN that her camp is a “registered Moroccan company with proper documentation and paying high taxes each month to the Moroccan government. We have proper insurance to run the camp.” She continued, “We have adequate security procedures in place at the camp to ensure the safety of everyone.” The removal of the camps has received heavy backlash from the locals in Merzouga. On Monday, March 11, hundreds of locals protested the decision at a demonstration. The protesters waved Moroccan flags and carried banners, saying, “No to the unjust negative decisions” and “Together for dialogue for the legalization and organization of desert tourism camps.” The National Union of Tourism and Transport also released a statement denouncing the actions of local authorities, saying the dismantlement of camps would hurt “our brothers, the professionals, and employers of the camps, and destroying their tents and will make a large number of the workers in the region unemployed.” The union again reaffirmed its support for those affected, saying, “We confirm as the National Union of Tourist Transport belonging to the General Union of Democratic Workers in Morocco that we will support them due to the damage that this method will cause.”

Rabat – On Monday, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the 15 referees and 14 assistant referees who will undergo a training course in Casablanca from March 31 to April 4. The referees must pass medical, physical, and theoretical tests to make the final list for the tournament, scheduled for April 14-28 in Tanzania. The CAF referees committee meeting made the list with CAF President Ahmad Ahmad on February 26 at the headquarters in Cairo.

Kabakama has officiated two matches, between Mali and Cameroon and between South Africa and Mali. As for Njoroge, she  officiated the African Women’s Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon in 2016 and was nominated to officiate in the FIFA Under 20 Women’s World Cup. According to an interview with CAF, Kabakama, a teacher and an entrepreneur, stated: “After seeing no real opportunities at playing football, I turned to refereeing, and have loved it ever since.”

Rabat – The personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, has officially addressed invitations to a roundtable to the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict. AFP reported that the second roundtable will take place behind closed doors, like the first roundtable, which convened December 5-6 in Geneva. Diplomats quoted by AFP said that the objective is to deepen the talks that began in December on political and economic dimensions. While they do not expect a “breakthrough” during the second roundtable, one of the diplomats said that it would be “positive” if the second roundtable would experience the “same context, the same atmosphere, and same spirit.” None of the parties—Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario—have confirmed receiving formal invitations from Kohler. But the personal envoy had already announced his intention to invite the parties to a second roundtable during the first roundtable. The second roundtable is expected to meet March 21-22 with high level representatives from the parties. At the first roundtable, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita led a delegation which included Moroccan elected Sahrawis. Bourita is expected to lead the Moroccan delegation again. Morocco has been showing commitment to the UN-led political process but has also been emphasizing its principles that it will not accept a solution outside its autonomy plan, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. It is unclear who will lead the Algerian delegation after Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika replaced foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel in the wake of continuous protests against Bouteflika’s election campaign and recent postponement of the 2019 election. Polisario, protected by Algeria, did not make any official statement about the popular movement against Bouteflika’s regime.

Rabat – On Tuesday, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s Consultative Assembly Abdullah Mohammed Ibrahim Al Sheikh expressed his satisfaction with the “long-standing relations” between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Al Sheikh used nearly identical words to those Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita used when reporters asked him about the alleged friction between the two countries. Bourita said last month that Morocco’s diplomatic ties with Gulf countries are strong, especially with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The sentiment was repeated during an official meeting between Mohammed Ibrahim Al-Sheikh and Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. The bilateral talks took place during the 14th session of the Conference of the Parliamentary Union of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Member States in Rabat. Friction fading away? During the meeting, El Othmani also commended Saudi Arabia’s leadership on several issues, emphasizing the “convergence of the two countries’ positions in many international issues.” Morocco and Saudi Arabia have recently been exchanging formal letters pledging measures to strengthen their diplomatic ties.  The countries, however, have been at the center of rumors about deteriorating diplomatic ties because of Morocco’s neutral position on the Gulf crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar.  According to several analysts, Saudi Arabia was angered by Morocco’s neutrality. Saudi Arabia expressed its displeasure with Morocco’s neutrality when it voted against Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup in favor of United 2026 during the June 2018 FIFA vote.  Another move that angered Morocco came through Saudi Arabia’s pro-government news agency Al Arabia, which aired a documentary against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Following the documentary, rumors intensified about Morocco’s reaction, and some news outlets reported that the kingdom recalled its ambassador from Saudi Arabia. Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, denied the allegations, emphasizing that the ambassador had returned to Rabat as part of a normal consultation process. In a press conference in February, Bourita commended the excellent diplomatic ties between Morocco and Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The UAE, a member of the Saudi coalition blockading Qatar, also expressed “unwavering support” for Morocco’s territorial integrity. In a meeting with El Othmani on Monday in Rabat, the UAE’s Federal National Council director, Amal Bin Abdullah Al Qubaisi, said that Morocco’s territorial integrity is unquestionable and indisputable. The official also supported Morocco’s dialogue initiative of inviting Algeria to engage in direct and frank talks to break the stalemate. The official said that Morocco’s initiative is the best means to resolve the decades-long conflict between the two countries.

Rabat – Al Akhawayn Space for Children with Autism, a Moroccan association based in Rabat, is holding a campaign starting March 31 to spread awareness about autism in the country. The campaign will last for multiple days and include several awareness programs and sports activities, such as small marathons, for children with autism and their families.  Al Akhawayn hopes it will help parents connect with their children and learn more about what they can do to help them overcome their challenges. The campaign, at the same time, aims to inspire other associations and NGOs into action and into joining in spreading autism awareness. Established in 2011, Al Akhawayn Space for Children with Autism supports families and their children with autism by providing educational programs and a space for the children to help them socialize and communicate in a safe environment. The association is not the only initiator in raising autism awareness.  On the World Autism Awareness Day, April 2, the  Moroccan National Library in Rabat will also host a conference featuring several professors, researchers, psychologists, and health experts in the field of autism. The conference seeks to discuss issues such as schooling for children with autism in Morocco. It will present the latest developments in autism research and a report on the situation of autism in Morocco, discuss health coverage for autism, and organize awareness workshops for the parents of children with autism. The event will also provide psychological counseling for the parents to help ease their parental stress, given the impact of autism on the lives of parents. On April 4, the event will hold entertainment programs for the participants and their children with autism. Despite the lack of research and medical training for autism in Morocco, the country is taking steps to bridge the knowledge gap. In January, the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMPC) in Casablanca inaugurated the first university degree focused on the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Morocco and the rest of the Maghreb. Students pursuing the degree will receive three years of training on autism approaches and interventions to improve the lives of people on the spectrum. The training program seeks to produce 20 qualified professionals each year. The autism education degree program will also support families in difficult conditions to better care for their children with autism. The degree was created in partnership with the Mohammed VI National Center for People with Special Needs, the Orange Foundation in Morocco and France, and Belgium’s SUSA Foundation caring for children with autism.

Rabat – The General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) raided a house on Tuesday in the Massira II area in Temara, near Rabat, arresting at least 120 people allegedly planning to migrate irregularly, according to Moroccan newspaper Assabah.  The arrested individuals are of Bengali, Pakistani, Burmese and other nationalities. Police seized documents, passports, money, and other belongings. Police also arrested facilitators of irregular migration. The public prosecution opened an investigation into the matter, said Assabah. The Moroccan leader of the group, who was also arrested, is a Rabat resident, reported Aswat News. The group was also active in drug trafficking, said news outlet Almaghrib Today. Weapons and forged banknotes were allegedly found in the group’s possession. “In the morning, they arrested someone. He led them to the others,” a local told Chouf TV. “They’ve been living here for a month … They had fancy cars, money.”  Another local told the online television channel, “people were coming in and out [of the house.] They used to buy flatbread, medication, drugs … As a distraction, they used to go pray … We thought they were Muslims—they were speaking Arabic.” Morocco has been a transit country for migrants to Europe since the 1990s, according to Migration Policy. Many attempt to cross the Moroccan borders with Ceuta and Melilla to acquire refugee rights or find a way to cross the Mediterranean into mainland Europe. The police have made several arrests of undocumented migrants near the border with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.  Moroccan authorities transport some migrants back to major cities farther south, such as Casablanca, Rabat, or Agadir. Migrants often end up living in suburbs either to stay or to wait in the wings for the next opportunity to emigrate. Moroccan authorities thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts in 2018. Nearly 80 percent of the migrants (70,571) were foreigners, according to the National Observatory of Migration. The number represents a 37 percent increase from the previous year, according to a statement issued after a migration observatory meeting on Thursday. Despite the government’s attempts to integrate migrants, Human Rights Watch said that the government has not yet adopted the right to asylum. However, the NGO said that Morocco gave over 1,000 recognized refugees access to “essential public services, such as education and health, but not the right to work.”

Rabat – Cote d’Ivoire’s former international footballer Didier Drogba made a charity visit to Morocco to fight the “digital divide.” On Monday, Drogba went to Oussama Ibn Ziad primary school in Casablanca’s Hay Hassani neighborhood to inaugurate a computer room equipped with 9 computers, high-speed internet, and many IT tools. The initiative is aimed to raise awareness of technological evolution among young students. The visit was also an opportunity for Drogba to encourage children to collectively practice sports in parallel with studies, arguing that it teaches good manners and respect. For their part, students did not miss Drogba’s birthday and performed choreographed dances. They also prepared a birthday cake for him. Ippon Foundation conducted the project in partnership with the Peace and Sport organization and Supinfo International University. Supinfo students will take care of training students and teachers about new technologies. The three organizations have conducted similar charitable activities in France, Senegal, and Cote d’Ivoire with the same aim to establish computer rooms and give access to the internet to those in remote areas. The former Chelsea forwarder is the vice-president of Peace and Sport, whose main mission is to promote sports as a tool for peace. The ceremony was attended by the regional director of the Regional Academy for Education and Training (AREF) in Casablanca-Settat region, Abdelmoumen Tali; the governor of the Hay Hassani District Prefecture, Khadija Benchouikh; the president of the Ippon Foundation, Stephane Nomis; and the general manager of SUPINFO Morocco, Amine Zniber.

Rabat – Police in Ceuta have arrested four Moroccans who were hiding inside of a truck heading to continental Spain by ferry. According to Ceuta Actualidad, Ceuta arrested and the migrants and returned them on Friday, March 8, to their country. The news outlet reported that one of the undocumented migrants had been arrested four times for alleged undocumented migration attempts. It is not the first time authorities have found migrants hiding inside trucks to cross from Spanish enclaves to enter continental Spain.  In January, Melilla found two sub-Saharan migrants in two mattresses on top of a vehicle crossing from Morocco into Melilla. In February, a 15-year old Moroccan was crushed to death by a truck in Ceuta while trying to hide inside it to migrate to Europe. The undocumented migrant was from Morocco’s northern city Martil but had been in Ceuta for two months. Official data from Spanish authorities record that 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region arrived in Ceuta in 2018. Among the minors, 3,302 were boys and 42 were girls, many of whom came from the neighboring cities of Tetouan and Tangier in northern Morocco. Faced with the pressure of increasing migration attempts, Spain announced its intention to increase the height of the double border fences between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. Spanish Minister of the Interior Fernando Grande Marlaska said that the “height of the fence will be increased by 30 percent, reaching ten meters, where most of the entries occured.” Spain has also been working with Morocco on irregular migration.

Rabat – March 11 marked the anniversary of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, also known as 11-M, which Moroccan national Youssef Belhadj masterminded. The attacks killed 193, injured 2,000, and shocked the world. Fifteen years later, terrorism in Spain has evolved strikingly, according to a new report released Monday, March 11 by the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid. Individuals that Spain has identified as terrorists since 2012 are younger and more educated than their predecessors, the report said, and a rising number are Moroccan. Elcano’s report analyzed the profiles of 215 terrorists who died or were apprehended in Spain since the 11-M bombings. A turning point in Spanish terrorism surfaces from the data: Mid-2012, the year the conflict in Syria escalated into a civil war and global terrorism’s center of gravity shifted from Al Qaeda to ISIS. After that year, the annual average of terrorist detentions in Spain leapt from 23 in 2009-2011 to 60 in 2012-2018. The plurality of terrorists in Spain have Moroccan roots, and the number is growing. Nearly half of the terrorists Spain identified over the last seven years were born in Morocco, up 63 percent from the decade before. After Morocco, the most common country of origin for terrorists since 2012 was Spain itself, at 36 percent. Seven out of 10 of these Moroccan terrorists come from Morocco’s northern Rif region, where Elcano blames heightened poverty and poor state authority for breeding terrorist networks for years. In January, Moroccan authorities dismantled an ISIS cell in the region, arresting three suspects between the ages of 18 and 31. Of the Spanish nationals identified as terrorists since 2004, the majority (nearly 75 percent) of the individuals were born in Ceuta or Melilla, Spanish autonomous cities bordering the Rif region. Homegrown Spanish terrorism has also surged since 2012, the report found.  Before 2012, the majority of Spanish residents found to be terrorists were first generation immigrants. Now, most Spanish residents plotting terrorist activity are second generation immigrants, born in the country and radicalized domestically. The report named cultural tensions and isolation of Muslim immigrant populations as driving forces behind homegrown terror. The phenomenon has haunted other European countries in recent years, prompting EU governments to reorient their anti-terror strategies towards home. Despite the rising numbers of Moroccan-born terrorists in Spain, the two nations have a strong track record on anti-terrorist cooperation. In September, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said their cooperation “is an example to follow for other countries,” as the globe struggles to confront terrorist movements at home and abroad.

Rabat – Renewing their calls for social integration and decrying the “false promises” of Minister of Family Bassima Hakkaoui, a group of blind protesters have broken into the ministry headquarters once again. Rabat witnessed two protests on Tuesday. While the contractual teachers protested the government’s “disregard” for their demands to be integrated into public sector employment to receive healthcare and pensions, the National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders broke into the family ministry with gas bottles. All employees at the ministry headquarters in Agdal, Rabat, evacuated the building, fearing that the protesters might set it on fire because they carried gas bottles and climbed onto the rooftop. The protestors were threatening to kill themselves en masse if their problems were not solved. The incident is reminiscent of the same protesters’ sit-ins and demonstrations last September and October which went on for weeks for the same purpose. Back then, the protesters carried bottles of fuel and threatened to burn themselves alive if their calls to be employed and for “dignity” and “better living conditions” were to be ignored again. In October 2018, 25-year-old Saber El Haloui fell off the ministry’s roof during the sit-in, which was also organized by the National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders. The protesters said on Monday that although they met with Hakkaoui in October, the minister continues to “procrastinate” on finding them employment.

Rabat – An organization dedicated to Casablanca’s heritage, Casablanca Patrimoine, has launched its first think tank, “Blanche &amp; Plurielle,” to enhance and promote local Casablanca cultural heritage.  Created in 2018 in partnership with Radius, the think tank’s ambition is to safeguard and boost cultural heritage in the region of Casablanca-Settat.  The initiative is “part of the spirit and the dynamics” initiated by King Mohammed VI for promoting the cultural capital of Morocco. “The primary objective of the initiative is to boost the program with the aim of upgrading and promoting material and immaterial culture, the landscape of Casablanca-Settat region, and the rich and profound history and heritage of the metropolis,” said Ahmed Toufik Naciri, chief executive of Casablanca Patrimoine. Naciri, a former secretary of the Casablanca-Settat region, added that there is much potential in Casablanca’s cultural heritage. “We are willing to create synergies between different actors in the region and also to maintain a coherence in our endeavor.” Blanche and Plurielle says it will be a place for reflection. To meet this end, the think tank will conclude partnerships with the stakeholders of the Casablanca-Settat region.  Naciri stated that “the initial study is a way to better determine the expectations of different institutions in Casablanca as well as pinpoint the areas of convergence.” Casablanca Patrimoine will present the outcomes of the study at a seminar in June in Casablanca and hold debates and discussions with all parties involved. Casablanca Patrimoine says it grew out of a desire to highlight the city’s diversity and rich cultural legacy as an economic, cultural, and artistic hub with unique architectural history.  In a speech to ambassadors in April 2014, King Mohammed VI stressed the importance of cultural diplomacy.  “Cultural diplomacy should be encouraged,” the King stated, “as well as the organization of more artistic activities and exhibitions to promote the genuine Moroccan cultural heritage at the international level along with its authentic, rich, plural and unified identity.”

Rabat – Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Mohammad Shtayeh as prime minister on Sunday, March 10, and tasked him with forming a new government, reported the Palestinian news agency Wafa.  After the Rami Hamdallah government resigned on January 29, Abbas received Shtayyeh in his office and urged him to form Palestine’s 18th government, according to the president’s spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh. Shtayeh will have three weeks to form a new government. The time limit could be extended by two weeks if necessary. The new team will be tasked with speeding up the reunification of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and forging ahead with parliamentary elections in the West Bank—including Jerusalem—and Gaza “to support democracy,” Abbas stressed in the appointment letter. The new government must also “keep supporting financially the families of Palestinian prisoners in detention in Israeli prisons and those killed by the Israeli army,” he added.  The Shtayeh government should undertake “keeping the Palestinian people firm in their territory against Israeli settlement policies, defending Jerusalem and its Muslim and Christian holy sites against the Israeli efforts to change their status, and building a strong national economy,” Abbas continued. Shtayeh served as minister of housing and construction and the director of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction.  In 2009 and 2016, Shtayyeh was elected to Fatah’s Central Committee. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Sussex.  He served as a professor and dean at Birzeit University in the West Bank from 1989 to 1993.  The new government will operate in a climate of anticipation, especially in the Arab political arena, of what is known as the “deal of the century.”  In January, doubts increased about the veracity of a US-brokered peace solution in the Middle East.  Israeli Channel 13 then claimed that the Trump administration’s peace initiative would propose establishing a Palestinian state on 85 to 90 percent of the West Bank, with the capital of Palestine being located in “most Arab neighborhoods” in East Jerusalem.  The White House dismissed an Israeli channel’s claim that the US wanted to propose creating a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank as “unfounded speculation.”

Rabat – No major external support favors continuity of a military-led government in Algeria after the sitting president’s surprise decision to give up on his re-election bid. General Gaid Salah, the chief of staff the Algerian armed forces, who expected to replace President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as the country’s next strongman, has allegedly been told that no major power plans to support his presidential ambitions. As Algerians still experience the aftertaste of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race, the Algerian military leadership is believed to be seeking what most militaries tend to demand in the aftermath of major political development. They want to sustain or increase their visibility and political clout. General Salah, the embodiment of the country’s upper and revered military echelons, is believed to have exerted considerable political power for much of the two decades during which President Bouteflika, himself a fruit of the Algerian independence war, ruled the country. Now that Bouteflika is on his way out of the country’s political arena, Salah expected to seize the moment, according to a number of sources. The general reportedly eyed Bouteflika’s prospective departure as a golden opportunity to assert himself as the man of the hour of post-Bouteflika Algeria. One obstacle however is the suspicion that Western powers, including France and the US, are not especially welcoming of “another military government” in Algeria.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts, and Social Economy Mohamed Sajid held talks with Samuel Poulin, Canadian parliamentary assistant to the minister of tourism, on Monday in Rabat to discuss tourism.  The meeting confirmed ongoing efforts to set up direct flights between Moroccan cities and Quebec. Sajid stressed the need for direct flights to expand tourist traffic, especially for Moroccans living in Canada.  Montreal and Casablanca are connected with two daily non-stop flights, operated by Air Canada and Royal Air Maroc. The two companies said in August 2018 that they will each serve two flights a day staring in the summer of 2019. The two sides also agreed to improve cooperation in professional hotel training and tourism in general.  The minister also said it was important to reopen the office of the Moroccan National Tourist Office in Montreal to promote Morocco as a destination for Canadian tourists. “Reopening this office later this year will help instill a new dynamic among tourism operators in both countries to promote both destinations,” said Sajid.  He added that his ministry was willing to organize various activities in Canada centered on Moroccan tourism, cuisine, and crafts. Poulin echoed the need to promote tourism, air transport cooperation and direct flights. The Quebec government announced the plan to open a representative office in Rabat in June 2018. While Morocco was Canada’s 55th bilateral trade partner in 2016, the country has close ties with Quebec Province with many years of bilateral relations, cooperation, and immigration. Morocco has a consulate and in Montreal, the largest city in Quebec.  Morocco is regularly listed among the five countries that send the most immigrants to Quebec. The province had a relatively large Moroccan community of over 73,000 people in 2016.  Some members of Quebec’s Moroccan community have also risen in the political scene in Canada. In January, Moroccan Nizar Berdai, who moved to Canada in 2015, became a member of the Youth Parliament of Quebec. Berdai said he had plans to advance the interests of the Moroccan community in Canada. Moncef Derraji and Marwah Rizqy, two Canadians of Moroccan descent, both living in Quebec, were elected to the Canadian Parliament in Canada’s latest provincial elections in October.

Rabat – Boys as young as eight have been raped in the war-torn Yemeni city of Ta’iz, said Amnesty International in a new report. The suspected perpetrators, who include Saudi-backed militiamen, have yet to be held accountable. Amnesty reported the rape of three boys and the sexual assault of a fourth in Ta’iz in the past eight months. The families of all four boys reported the cases to the Criminal Investigations Department, but authorities have yet to take action. In two of the four cases, families claim that the perpetrators were members of Islahi-backed militias. Al-Islah is a Yemeni Islamist party which acts in support of the Saudi-led Coalition and Yemeni government. The party controls large portions of local authorities in Ta’iz. Two civilian suspects have been detained and are awaiting trial but none of the militia-connected suspects in the other two cases have faced any consequences. The mother of the 8-year-old told Amnesty International that her son had been raped at the mosque on two occasions, in June and October 2018, by the son of a local Ishali imam and his friend. His mother says that the boy “now suffers from a sleeping disorder and is prone to uncontrollable crying and screaming.” According to his family, a 13-year-old was raped at the mosque by the same two men. Another boy says he was attacked by an Islahi-aligned militiaman who beat him, held him at gunpoint, and raped him. This 16-year-old boy’s mother described his return home after the assault: “He just sat there staring into space. He was unable to sit afterward to go to the bathroom for three days.” The fourth boy, a 12-year-old, was assaulted in July 2018 but managed to escape before he was raped. In his escape, the boy shot and killed his attacker, a member of the Islahi militia. Despite reporting the incident to the authorities, the family received no protection. Two days after the initial attack, militiamen belonging to the same group as the original man attacked the family of the boy in their home. Three members of the family were killed and one was injured.   Amnesty International reported the likelihood that there are many more cases than the four which have been reported. Families are discouraged from reporting any attacks for fear of reprisals such as the one faced by the family of the 12-year-old. The unwillingness to report is strengthened by a pattern of impunity granted to many members of the militia. Background The city of Ta’iz has experienced intermittent clashes between Yemeni rebels and forces loyal to the Coalition and Yemeni government since 2015. In the four years of conflict, the violence has only intensified as militias have thrived in the chaos of the ongoing conflict. Ta’iz is widely considered a humanitarian disaster. Fighting in Yemen has left 6,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 injured. According to the Yemen Data Project and Save the Children, there have been more than 18,000 air raids since the beginning of the war in 2015. This means that children born in Yemen as the conflict broke out have lived through an average of 14 air raids per day. In reference to the rape cases, Heba Morayef, the regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, said that “The heartbreaking testimonies of these young survivors and their families expose how the ongoing conflict has rendered children vulnerable to being sexually exploited in a city plagued by weak security and institutions.” UN reports that sexual violence against boys and men during armed conflicts is common but underreported. Because of this underreporting, boys are left vulnerable without sufficient prevention and protection strategies.   Save the Children spokesperson Bhanu Bhatnagar said that “Yemen is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child today.”

Rabat – Minister of Energy, Minerals, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah inaugurated the re-opening of the ministry’s Museum of Geology, Minerals, and Energy on Tuesday after renovations were completed. Rabbah also launched a mobile application of national geoscience maps the ministry prepared. In his opening speech, Rabbah said that the preservation of national heritage is of great importance to the ministry. He added that several institutional, legal, educational, and media measures have taken place to preserve, value, and promote Morocco’s heritage nationally and internationally.  The minister stressed that Morocco’s national geological heritage is the main lever of Morocco’s attractiveness in terms of tourism and reflects the richness and diversity of its geological history. Rabbah said that the application’s goal is to evaluate geological data for the national geological authority, facilitate access to knowledge, promote scientific geological mapping in Morocco, enable the exchange of data by developing databases and information systems, and enhance the geological and mineral attractions of the country. The application will provide all the maps Morocco has made in the last 100 years. It will also give users access to future workshops through search engines linking objective data to the administrative divisions of the country. Rabbah believes the app will help national and regional decision-making.

Rabat – On Monday, Algerians came out on the streets Monday night to celebrate President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to withdraw his candidacy for president in the 2019 election. Algerians are now expressing concerns that Bouteflika’s decision might be a trick to avoid further pressure and tension. After announcing his decision, Bouteflika said that he would also postpone the 2019 presidential election planned for April 18. In response, a popular Algerian satirical Twitter account tweeted, “We said no to a fifth term. He said, Ok Baby, we will stay together under the fourth,” referring to the decision as a trick to extend Bouteflika’s fourth term. Thousands of Algerians shared the same concerns that the decision is just a way to allow Bouteflika to stay in power for an indefinite period. After an overnight celebration, students rallied again on Tuesday in Algiers, accusing the president of attempting to extend his mandate, which ends April 28. The protests swept several major cities in Algeria. One Al Ghad television channel reporter said that protesters do not have confidence in the regime. “The government can be changed but … this mean nothing for Algerians who are calling for a real reform.” In addition to protesting Bouteflika, citizens are also protesting against the elites, a group of army officers, generals, businessmen known as “le pouvoir.” In a letter addressed to Algerian citizens on Monday, Bouteflika announced the holding of the presidential election as an extension of the “inclusive and independent” national conference and the “formation of a government of national competences.” Protesters today, however, held banners reading: “No for a fourth or fifth mandate,” and “Leave means leave,” condemning Bouteflika’s decision to postpone the election. The television reporter said that the majority of Algerians reject Bouteflika’s decision to postpone the election. In his letter, published by Algerian government news agency APS, the ailing president said: “Given my state of health and age, my last duty towards the Algerian people was always contributing to the foundation of a new Republic.” Shortly after his announcement, Ahmed Ouyahia resigned as prime minister. Bouteflika accepted his resignation, and appointed Algerian interior minister Noureddine Bedoui in Ouyahia’s place.

Rabat – The National Tangier Film Festival concluded March 9 with the announcement of winners at a ceremony on Saturday evening. One of the biggest winners in the festival, which began March 1, was Mohamed Zineddiaine, a Moroccan expat in Italy, who took home four prizes for his moving film “La Guerissuese” (The Healer).  The film follows the story of a teenage boy (played by Ahmed Moustafa) living on the outskirts of small Moroccan mining town who wants to learn how to read and write to gain social mobility. However, his adoptive mother, the village healer (played by Fatima Atif), forbids him from getting an education. One day, the boy convinces a 30-year-old cynical pickpocket (played by Medhi Laaroubi) to seek treatment from his adoptive mother for his horrible eczema. From that day onwards the three characters become intertwined. The film won the Jury’s Prize, as well as Best Production, Best Actress for Fatima Atif, and Best Actor for Medhi Laaroubi. In his speech, Zineddiane expressed his surprise, saying, “I never expected to win one prize for the film, let alone four. Can you imagine?” Zineddiane himself came from humble beginnings, not unlike the protagonist of his film. He was born in the small village of Oued-Zem in Morocco in 1957. Even though he was a mediocre student, he was transfixed by books from a young age and spent all of his time reading. In 1983, he left his small village behind to study computer science at the University of Nice. However, he quickly realized this was not his passion and switched paths a year later to begin training as a director in Bologna, Italy. He has been pursuing creative arts, such as photography, journalism, and film, ever since. His feature films include “La Vecchia Ballerina” (2002), “Reveil” (2004), “Do You Remember Adil?” (2008), “Anger” (2012) and of course, “The Healer” (2018). Zineddiane heavily praised Fatima Atif for her role as healer, saying, “It is time the spotlight falls upon this great actress.” Fatima Atif graduated from the Superior Institute of Dramatic Art in Rabat and has since made many appearances in theater, television, and film. Medhi Laaroubi, who won Best Actor for his role of the pickpocket, already worked with Zineddiane once before in “Do You Remember Adil?”. Zineddiane again reiterated his respect for the two stars of his film, saying, “I’m so proud of them both because they brought their own intensity, energy, and truth to the film. Ultimately, ‘La Guerissuese’ is the work of great actors.” Saturday’s ceremony marked the end of the 20th National Tangier Film Festival, where 30 films competed in front of a respected jury. Farida Benlyazid, a respected Moroccan director and screenwriter, headed the jury. Also on board was Layane Chawaf, who is in charge of cinema at the Institute of the Arab World in Paris, the French comedian Lily Bloom, and several others.

Rabat – In the wake of the crash of a Boeing 737 MAX-8 on Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET-302, countries around the world have grounded dozens of the same model, and mourning for the lives lost continues. In the latest restriction, the United Kingdom’s Civil Aviation Authority “issued instructions to stop any commercial passenger flights from any operator arriving, departing or overflying UK airspace” for the 737 MAX on March 12. The plane crashed less than 70 kilometers from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Adaba, killing all 157 people on board from 35 different countries. Two of the fatalities were Moroccan. Read Also: Dr. Ben Ahmed Chihab was the regional director of environment from the Draa Tafilalet region in eastern Morocco. Chihab, a biologist and ecologist, was on his way to attend the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi. Othman Makhon was also a UN delegate representing the Moroccan Ministry of Youth. Of the 157 people on board the fatal flight, 22 were delegates bound to participate in the assembly. During the first day of the assembly on March 11, attendees observed several minutes of silence for their lost colleagues.  King Mohammed VI has also expressed his sympathy and sent his condolences to the families of Chihab and Makhon. Following the crash, the Boeing company released an official statement expressing its condolences to the families. The company said, “A Boeing technical team will be travelling to the crash site to provide technical assistance under the direction of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.” Concerns with the Boeing model In reaction to the accident, Morocco’s national carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has indefinitely grounded its two Boeing 737 MAX-8 jets. RAM declined to comment on its decision to Morocco World News. The company received its first Boeing 737 MAX-8 in December. The plane began taking passengers to Barcelona, Paris, and London on January 1. Other airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways, MIAT Mongolian Airlines, Lion Air, Aerolineas Argentinas, and Aeromexico have also chosen to ground their 737 MAX-8 fleets. Entire countries, such as China, Indonesia, and Singapore, announced the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by airlines within their respective countries. China Southern Airlines is the company most affected because it operates 23 MAX-8s. The Ethiopian flight is the second deadly accident involving a 737 MAX 8 in the past five months. On October 29, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea, less than 15 minutes after its take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia—killing all 189 people on board. According to Boeing, there are more than 300 models of 737-MAX planes in operation, and airlines have ordered more than 5,000 worldwide since 2017. Malindo Air operated the 737 MAX 8’s first commercial flight from Malaysia to Singapore in May 2017. Six months later, in November 2017, Ethiopian Airlines purchased the 737 MAX 8 that would later crash. While flight tracking site FlightRadar24 reports the plane’s vertical speed was immediately unstable after takeoff, the cause of the accident is still uncertain. But on March 11, Ethiopian Airlines announced it had recovered Flight ET-302’s Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder from the wreckage. Their hope is that investigators will be able to recreate the final moments of the flight and explain the cause behind the fatal crash.

Rabat – Being barged in on and beaten by nearly 100 teenagers in their own home was not how the Boukhizzou family imagined spending Monday evening. The Moroccan family experienced a vicious attack at their home in Urk, the Netherlands. As the mother tried to defend her family, the attackers hit her and injured her daughter, throwing rocks and fireworks. But their main target was the Moroccan family’s 18-year-old son, Soufyan. The attackers shouted “Geert Wilders” while they attacked the family. Geert Wilders is a Dutch anti-Islamist and far-right politician. The attackers invoking Wilders’ name suggests to some that their motives were “racist” or Islamophobic, as Dutch media have reported. Wilders holds special political discontent with Islam and Moroccans. The anti-migration MP has sparked outrage multiple times, especially when he called all Moroccan migrants “scum” two years ago and said he wanted to make the Netherlands “ours again.” Local residents, however, alleged that Soufyan had offended the girlfriend of one of his neighbors. “You shouldn’t do that as a Moroccan,” a Dutch lady told the Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, referring to Soufyan. There are, however, two sides to the story. While the Moroccan family’s neighbors criticized Soufyan’s “offensive” behavior towards the girlfriend, Soufyan said the attack was fueled by “revenge” and built on “misunderstandings.” Soufyan, who was born in Urk, said that a fellow Dutchman beat him up two years ago. When Soufyan’s mother reported it to the police, officers never followed up with the family. The teenager said that his family is misunderstood, emphasizing that he did not receive any compensation for the attack from two years ago. “People think we received a compensation for it because my father bought a Mercedes a while ago.” Soufyan said that earlier on Monday, someone had warned him of the impending attack. He sensed that someone was pursuing him throughout the day. Soufyan tried to hide at a bar but was relieved when he saw a police car driving nearby and requested the policeman to take him home.  “Soon after, a large group of angry young people were at the door” of his house, he told Dutch media. The police, who soon intervened to disperse the mob with batons, advised Soufyan, his parents, and sister Ilham to stay at home. The family fears that they will be attacked if they go outside. “We are not safe. We are terrified,” Soufyan stated.       An investigation is underway into the real motives behind the violence.  There have been numerous notorious anti-Islamic acts in the Netherlands, the most recent of which was against a mosque in Hague—frequented by Moroccan worshippers—by the German group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida). Pegida hung a banner with an obscene message insulting Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) at the entrance of the As-Sunnah Mosque next to a mannequin dressed in traditional male Arab dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint.

Rabat – The European Investment Bank (EIB) has granted Morocco an €80 million loan. EIB announced the loan agreement in a meeting today with Morocco’s National Motorway Company (ADM). In a statement, ADM said that the loan would fund roadwork in Casablanca “to ease traffic.” ADM hopes to use the loan to improve transport conditions, mobility, and road safety in Morocco. The loan is set to fund construction work to widen the Casablanca-Berrechid highway to three lanes over 25.8 kilometers and a 31.7 kilometer Casablanca bypass. “This project falls within the framework of the ‘National Highway Structure Scheme,’ which aims to develop the road network of the kingdom,” the statement added. EIB Vice President Emma Navarro expressed satisfaction with the agreement. “We are delighted, as a bank of the European Union to continue to support the competitiveness of Morocco, with which we celebrate our forty years of cooperation.” She added that the loan is in line with Europe’s desire to “support the development of Moroccan infrastructure,” because it will improve mobility and quality of life in Casablanca. The general dDirector of ADM, Anouar Benazzouz, said that his department is proud of EIB’s contribution. “It is a recognition of the professionalism and credibility of the projects undertaken by ADM and on the other hand, it is an EIB participation in a large-scale project led by ADM that will help support the development of the Casablanca metropolis, improve traffic flow and enhance user safety.” The agreement is the 10th of its kind between EIB and ADM. According to ADM, EIB has invested nearly €5 billion in projects in key sectors of the Moroccan economy, such as urban transport, energy, and the private sector, since 2007. What about debts? Several senior officials and businessmen have complained about the consequences of public debts on Morocco’s economy. In January, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami said that Morocco’s economy will be weighed down by debt in 2019. The commissioner also warned that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP by the end of 2019, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018. The Treasury and External Finance Department said that Morocco’s external funding increased by 35.7 percent between 2016 and 2018. The increase in external funding led to Morocco’s accumulated MAD 332.35 billion in public external debt in 2017.

Rabat – Hundreds of teachers marched outside the headquarters of the Human Resources Department of the Ministry of Education in Rabat on Monday. The protest kick-started a four-day mobilization campaign.  The protesters gathered under the leadership of the “Cell 9” Teachers National Coordination, whose name references a prison cell; the government’s 9th pay grade; and a pun on “Tazmamart Cell 10;” a book by a Moroccan former military officer Ahmed Marzouki.  The Cell 9 group includes the Democratic Labor Confederation’s National Education Union (SNE-CDT), the Democratic Labor Federation’s National Education Union (SNE-FDT), and the National Teaching Federation (FNE). The group is calling for the immediate promotion of its teachers. The teachers, who have for several years been paid at the 9th pay grade, are calling for an increase in their salaries and their promotion to the 10th pay grade.  The teachers also have a list of demands that the government has so far not met. Among their demands is opening a serious dialogue with the government to find a solution to their complaints.  According to news site 24ala24, the protesters broke into the human resources department for a sit-in. Police arrested some of them before releasing them later.. Minister of Education Said Amzazi met with five unions to discuss the complicated situation of contract teachers on Saturday.  Last week, contractual teachers held a “six-day regional sit-in” across the country, accompanied by a “national strike.” The National Federation of Teachers (UMNT) expressed its solidarity with the teachers and denounced what they called “retaliatory actions against teachers who were forced to sign contracts.” Morocco’s Ministry of Higher Education has announced it will abolish the contractual employment of teachers for a fixed term and proposed instead to hire them permanently within regional academies. The ministry published a statement on Saturday stating that the contractual teachers would enjoy all the rights that permanent teachers employed by the government have, but within the regional academies with whom they initially signed the contract.

Rabat – In a meeting with Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in Rabat on Monday, the director of the UAE’s Federal National Council, Amal Bin Abdullah Al Qubaisi, reaffirmed her country’s unwavering support for Morocco’s territorial integrity with regard to Western Sahara. Morocco’s territorial integrity is unquestionable and undisputable, said Al Qubaisi. The official’s remarks come at a time when Morocco’s relationship with the UAE’s closest ally, Saudi Arabia, is experiencing tension. Appreciated dialogue Morocco’s government said in a press release that Al Qubaisi highly appreciated King Mohammed VI’s move to open dialogue with Algeria, which she noted would be the best means to resolve the decades-long conflict between the two countries. Al Qubaisi also commended Morocco’s stability and the level of development it has attained. She also expressed her pleasure at the relationship existing between Morocco and the UAE, wishing that the two countries would strengthen the relationship, particularly with regards to higher education, handicrafts, and sustainable development. El Othmani also expressed his satisfaction with the UAE’s support regarding the Western Sahara conflict, emphasizing that threats to the integrity of Moroccan territory hinder the stability and sovereignty of the Moroccan population. The head of government equally emphasized the strong bonds between Morocco and UAE, predicated on fraternity and humanity, and the longstanding friendship between the Moroccan and Emirati populations.  El Othmani particularly noted the two countries’ political relationship and the efforts the UAE has made to cement it and to include both economic and cultural aspects.  In 2016, Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), a foreign aid agency, sent a special delegation to Morocco to study the possibilities of funding new projects targeting sustainable development in areas such as health, education, and energy.  The director-general of the ADFD said the initiative will help the socio-economy thrive across all key sectors and create new job opportunities. In late 2018, Morocco also affirmed its support for the UAE’s national unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty regarding the UAE’s three islands: the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa.

Rabat – A study Dove Medical Press published on Monday finds that one-third of Morocco’s medical students suffer from eating disorders. Titled “Eating disorders among Moroccan medical students: cognition and behavior,” the study shows that Moroccan medical students are at high risk for the core components of eating disorders. These components include bulimia, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, and restrictive eating habits. A group of international researchers evaluated 710 medical students from the University Hospital of Fez. These students were between their first and sixth year of medical school, with a median age of 21. The researchers collected subjects’ data, including age, sex, marital status, monthly income, familial medical history, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Among the students, 32.8 percent suffer from eating disorders with 18.5 percent engaging in weight-control behaviors that could threaten their health. Previously, researchers have studied medical students’ vulnerability to developing eating disorders, but this is the first study to focus on Morocco. Like medical students of other nationalities, Moroccan students are at higher risk for eating disorders than the general population due to their age, academic stress, workload, and exposure to disease and death. The study directly links eating disorders with behaviors such as fasting, induced vomiting, and appetite suppressants. The majority of previous studies conducted on the topic of eating disorders focus only on the ways wealthy white women are affected. The new study about Moroccans shows that issues of eating disorders concern those outside of such a limited demographic. The study links the increase in eating disorders in Morocco with a Western standard of beauty which has been spread through the rise of mass media and the globalization of communication technology. Young Moroccans, fed a distorted standard of beauty coupled with misleading and damaging messages about nutrition and health, find themselves at significant risk for developing eating disorders. The messages are inherently contradictory as they simultaneously promote increased consumption and an impossible standard of thinness. In response to these messages, people often engage in both restrictive and purgative behaviors. These behaviors include dieting, fasting, vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants or laxatives. While the media messages primarily target women, the disparity between men and women has lessened, leaving men increasingly at risk. The trend can be seen in the study’s findings regarding gender: The prevalence among women was higher at 37.6 percent, but 23.7 percent of the male subjects also experienced eating disorders. There was no substantive difference between men and women in terms of weight-control behaviors.   Still, women do tend to have more body dissatisfaction than men. Female subjects often express increased satisfaction when they are underweight rather than a normal weight or overweight. Many previous studies found that subjects’ socioeconomic status affected their likelihood of developing an eating disorder. However, the study in Morocco found that socioeconomic class was not a predictor of eating disorders at all. It is possible that the difference is a reflection of cultural differences between Morocco and the West. However, there was not significant socioeconomic diversity in this study, with 84.9 percent of participants coming from the middle class. The researchers recommend the completion of future studies to better understand the recorded behavior.  They propose further research exploring eating disorders in other future health practitioners, such as pharmacists and nurses, and an increased focus on Moroccan individuals to better develop more specificity.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI expressed deep condolences and sympathy with the families of two Moroccan victims, El Hassan Sayouty and Ahmed Chihab, who lost their lives in the ET302 plane crash in Addis Ababa. El Hassan Sayouty, a researcher at Hassan II University in Casablanca, and Ahmed Chihab, the regional director of the environment from the Draa-Tafilalet region in eastern Morocco were headed to Nairobi, Kenya, to participate in the 4th United Nations Environment Assembly as Moroccan delegates. The Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed six minutes after it took off from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. At the start of the UN meeting in Nairobi, the assembly observed a moment of silence for the 22 UN staff who died in the crash. The causes of the crash have not yet been determined, but several countries, including Morocco, have grounded all Boeing 737 Max-8 jets as the same model crashed during a flight operated by Lion Air in October, killing 189 people onboard. Morocco’s national carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) temporarily suspended use of its two Max-8s as of Monday.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has reportedly met with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler in Paris. Several news outlets quoted diplomatic sources confirming the rumored meeting took place February 27-28. Moroccan analyst Abdelfattah El Fatihi told Morocco World News that information about the meeting is scarce because Kohler called for it to be confidential. The Polisario Front, however, shared news about its meeting with Kohler in Berlin last week. El Fatihi said that Polisario’s move is a sign that the front senses that it has become a secondary party in the regional conflict. “The Polisario Front is starting to show its legal aspect by announcing the meeting with Kohler in Berlin as well as [to influence] public opinion in the camps, whose population is losing confidence in the front’s ability to achieve ‘independence.’” Several Algerian news outlets rumored about a secret meeting between Kohler and Algeria’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel on March 2. Delegations from Morocco and Algeria met in a roundtable in Geneva December 5-6, 2018, for consultations before potential negotiations led by the UN to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution. The roundtable also involved Mauritania and the Polisario Front. The UNSG’s personal envoy has also invited the parties to another roundtable, which will take place March 21-22 in Geneva, Switzerland. The date, however, has not been confirmed yet.

Rabat – Four Moroccan agricultural workers in France have filed complaints against their employers for exploiting them. The Moroccan workers testified yesterday at French labor court, the Conseil de Prud’hommes in Arles, southern France, saying their conditions were close to “slavery.” The workers, three women and one man, who came to France as temporary workers with a Spanish temp agency named Laboral Terra, are demanding a requalification in their employment contract to make it open-ended, known in France and Morocco as “CDI.” The workers, aged 36-48, harvested fruits and vegetables but accused their employers of overworking them. They explained that they do not get paid overtime, paid leave, or compensation for work accidents, a violation of the French labor code. One of the women plaintiffs told French news outlet France3 that their situation is “no longer temporary work but slavery.” “Many other people were in the same situation but did not dare to speak for fear of being sent back to their countries,” she stated. It is the second time that the same workers have come before the labor court to testify about their situation. They met their employers in trial in October and yesterday, they came to hear the court’s decision. The Spanish temp agency, however, said that the workers’ complaints were way out of proportion to the problem. The situation, albeit not including sexual assault complaints, is reminiscent of the situation of Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain who filed complaints against their employers for sexual assault in May 2018. The assault complaints made international headlines and prompted Morocco’s Ministry of Employment to carry out an investigation on the Spanish farms and take precautions by sending commissions to Spain this year to avoid a repeat of last year’s sexual assaults.

Rabat – Coach Herve Renard has unveiled his official list of the 33 footballers who will take part in Morocco’s final qualifier game of the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) against Malawi and the friendly game against Argentina. The list includes Moroccan-Dutch Idrissi Oussama, who will be playing with the Atlas Lions for the first time after choosing to represent Morocco instead of the Netherlands. Both Hamza Mendyl and Nabil Dirar, who played with Morocco in the 2018 World Cup, are not on the list. The two Moroccan goalkeepers Munir El Kajoui,  who plays for Malaga, and Bounou Yassine, who plays for Girona, have made the list. Although he missed multiple CAN qualifier games last year, the captain of the Moroccan football team Mehdi Benatia is on the list, as well as favorites Younes Belhanda, Amine Harit, Faycal Fajr, and Achraf Hakimi. The full list is as follows:   
Morocco’s football team will play against Malawi on March 22.  Morocco has already qualified for CAN 2019 after defeating the Comoros in the qualifier games in November 2018. The defeat gained Morocco a qualification to CAN, also known as AFCON. The Atlas Lions will then play a friendly game against Argentina on March 26 in Tangier. The friendly match is part of the Atlas Lions’ preparation for CAN.

Rabat – The Court of Appeals in Tangier has dropped its charges against Spanish activist Helena Maleno. Morocco had charged Maleno, a spokesperson and activist for migrants, in 2017 with colluding with human traffickers to illegally move people across borders. However, the court confirmed on Monday that there was no evidence of a crime. Based in Tangier for the last 16 years, Maleno leads the NGO Walking Borders, or Caminando Fronteras. Founded in 2002, the organization acts as a lifeline for migrants who are trying to reach Europe by crossing from Morocco to Spain. Walking Borders also documents human rights violations on both sides of the border and provides legal, social, and medical support to migrants. Maleno regularly receives calls from migrants in distress as they attempt the perilous Mediterranean crossing and then alerts maritime authorities in Spain, Morocco, and Algeria to the existence and location of the boats. In a speech earlier this year, the Spanish minister of interior development, Jose Luis Albalos Meco, said that 70 percent of calls to maritime authorities regarding boats at risk come from Maleno herself or her organization. The statement was backed up by Captain Miguel Zea, maritime rescue chief in Almeria, Spain, who has said that Maleno “is the person who has saved the most lives in the Strait – at least 10,000.” Throughout the proceedings, Maleno has received an outpouring of support both within Spain and internationally. In a statement published by Walking Borders, more than 200 Spanish figures spoke out in support of Maleno and her work. Among those figures were teachers, journalists, professors, and even actors, such as Javier Bardem. The statement defends Maleno against “criminalization and harassment” and asserts her right to continue saving lives and fighting against “European policies which have turned the Mediterranean Sea into a mass grave.”   UN human rights experts have denounced the case against Maleno, including the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders in a report to the UN Human Rights Council in 2018.   Maleno has won international recognitions with several awards, including the human rights award “Nacho de la Mata” (2015), the Human Rights Award of the Human Rights Association of Spain (2018), and the MacBride Peace Prize (2018). Criminal charges The charges Morocco filed against Maleno have their origins in an investigation led by Spain’s Unit for Combating Immigration Networks and Document Counterfeiting (UCRIF) in 2012. The investigation was sparked by frequent calls made by Maleno to naval authorities regarding boats of migrants in the western Mediterranean waters. The calls, despite saving countless lives, also aided directly in the migrants’ transfer to the Spanish coast. In April 2017, Spain found insufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case but passed the investigation on to Morocco. The Moroccan courts first dismissed the case in December 2018, but Monday’s announcement, in response to an appeal filed with the Moroccan Prosecutor’s Office, stands as final.     For the first time since 2012, Maleno is free of the possibility of facing time in prison. Maleno responded to the news in a video she posted to her Twitter. In the video, she expresses that while she is “happy to be free,” the struggle does not end with the charges being dropped. She said that “this is a very difficult time for human rights defenders as we are being persecuted and criminalized … To defend the right to life is not a crime.”

Rabat – A man opened fire on passersby with a shotgun yesterday evening in Guelmim, southern Morocco, leaving 1 dead and 11 injured, including 2 policemen. The shooter fired at people from the rooftop of his residence in the Tekna neighborhood in Guelmim. The middle-aged man, born in 1975, used to live abroad and may have mental problems, according to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). DGSN arrested the shooter yesterday with the help of Guelmim’s provincial police and regional intervention brigades, who fired at the shooter’s legs to stop him and seize his shotgun. The DGSN said that the shooter opened fire “for no apparent reason.” The victims are now receiving care at the local military hospital. The person who died was 27 or 28, born in 1991. An investigation is underway to determine any reason behind the shooting.

Rabat – Emirati President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan announced on Sunday that the Moroccan Saham Agri Company jointly won an award for “distinguished innovative studies and modern technology” with the Namibian Desert Fruit Company. The award was part of the 11th Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. The Saham Agri company is currently situated on a farm in Draa-Tafilalet region in south-east Morocco and has large plantations of “majhoul” dates. Oussama Gatti, the managing director of the company, said that the farm covers 630 hectares with 55,000 palm trees and produces 7,500 tons of dates per year.  Gatti said that the award is a culmination of Morocco’s specific efforts to develop agriculture as a result of the green plan King Mohammed VI launched in 2008. The green plan aimed to plant 3 million palm trees by 2020. Saham, which started the farm in 2014, is working to cultivate a second farm, which Gatti says will improve Moroccan production of majhoul dates. In his award speech, Sheikh Nahyan said, “In this year, 2019, the award will celebrate the Year of Tolerance, because tolerance leads to nations of peace, advancement, growth, and confidence in the future.” Later, Sheikh Nahyan welcomed the winners into his palace and expressed his appreciation for the international interest in the UAE’s “International Date Palm Conference,” which the Emirates has hosted for over 20 consecutive years.

By Mary Bernard Rabat – Three generations of two families—one Vietnamese, the other Moroccan—have been in business together for nearly 70 years to keep Rabat’s first Asian restaurant open to the public. The longevity of Le Mandarin has made it a landmark in the L’Ocean neighborhood. But Tuan Le, 41, the grandson of the restaurant’s founder, will be the last member of his family to own and run the establishment. On February 5, Le sold the restaurant to Rhizlan El-Oufir, a Moroccan woman whose grandfather originally rented the establishment to Le’s grandfather, Xa Nguyen, in the early 1950s. Nguyen, a sailor from Vietnam, came to Morocco in the 1930s. Vietnam, at the time, was a French territory within Indochina, and Morocco was a territory in French West Africa. Unlike the other places he visited, Nguyen did not leave. Why Nguyen settled in Morocco remains a mystery to his family. But the significance of the decision is not lost on them. “He opened, from nothing, a restaurant,” Le said. “He made a living in Morocco which was really hard at that time, much better than he could have done in Vietnam.” El Oufir says she wants to maintain the historic eatery’s legacy, partly out of sentimental attachment. “It’s a familial affair,” El-Oufir, 38, said in French. “My grandfather rented to his grandfather, then my father rented to his father.” The restaurant offers Asian food, with a specialty in Vietnamese, to a range of customers, from regulars who have come to the restaurant weekly for decades to foreigners picking up fried rice to-go. During the day, passersby might not notice the red barricade rolled down to block the entrance, with chipping yellow paint denoting the hours of service. At night, the propped-open ornate door is the only sign of life, the inside’s faded decor revealing years of gentle use. Opened in 1952, Le Mandarin claims to be the first Asian restaurant in Rabat. In the country, an Asian eatery in Casablanca purportedly preceded Le Mandarin by a few years. Ex-owner Tuan Le was born in Vietnam but grew up in Morocco when his parents returned to run Le Mandarin. He went to college in Paris and only came back to Rabat a decade ago to relieve his aging parents of the restaurant. Divorced with no children, he had no particular reason to stay or go, but he never intended to remain in Rabat for long. Le’s happiness to be leaving the restaurant behind is only matched by El-Oufir’s excitement to be taking over. El-Oufir, who previously owned a spa and massage parlor, is particularly motivated to succeed because of her family’s legacy. “Here, [customers] can feel that the food is old-fashioned,” El-Oufir said. “I want it to stay that way.” Over the years, the food has changed with the neighborhood around it. L’Ocean became a popular, middle-class district around the time that Nguyen began making the egg rolls with Moroccan wheat paper rather than Vietnamese rice paper, Le said. “Customers like something that looks like their [Moroccan] food,” Le said. “That’s why it’s not really authentic.” Besides rice paper, the lack of fresh herbs and dog meat, a Vietnamese favorite, hinders the authenticity of the food. Ranging from MAD 65 to 80 for an entree, a meal comes to about the same price as other mid-tier restaurants in the area. The menu includes a variety of Asian foods including soups, seafood, noodle dishes, and woks. Jasmine tea is the drink most commonly served with the food, but cocktails, beer, and wine are available as well. El-Oufir hopes to modernize Le Mandarin while keeping its familiar and historic character. The same chef will remain in the kitchen to maintain similar flavors while expanding the menu, and El-Oufir also plans to hire a sushi chef in response to customer demands. Le Mandarin’s manager, Soufiane El-Bouni, 42, began working a month ago to assist Le and El-Oufir with the transition. According to him, the change in ownership will have no impact on the future of the restaurant and its staff. As for Le, his future in the restaurant business is unclear. For the time being, he plans to return to Paris where his parents live. Eventually, he wants to go back to Vietnam and visit his cousin’s new restaurant. “I have a part of Moroccan culture, but I feel Vietnamese, even if I never lived in Vietnam,” he said. “It’s time to go back.” Mary Bernard is spending several months in Morocco on an SIT study abroad program, and produced this story in association with Round Earth Media.

Rabat – Algeria’s Ahmed Ouyahia has resigned as  Prime Minister, leaving room for a new interim government to govern the country in the last days of the current regime.  The news came shortly after Algerians learned that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had decided to not seek a fifth term in the country’s next elections. Ouyahia was appointed as Prime Minister in August 2017, in replacement of Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika accepted Ouyahia’s resignation, thanking  him for his efforts and services during his tenure as Prime Minister. President Bouteflika then received Noureddine Bedoui, who he appointed prime minister to replace Ouyahia, according to Algerian official news agency APS. The newly-appointed prime minister is expected to appoint new members for the interim government.

Washington D.C – Despite the activities of several well-funded think tanks and the actions of few non-governmental organizations, Morocco have made little headways in promoting its agenda in countries where its positions in the Western Sahara conflict are either misunderstood or underreported. Notwithstanding few widely advertised travels to friendly countries and meetings with responsive organizations, Moroccan Think Thanks’ efforts fall short of making real impact on the positions and attitudes of hostile governments and unfriendly political and human rights groups. A good measuring tool for evaluating the success of a diplomatic event or a round table discussion is the amount of world media coverage such activities generate and the intensity of international social media activity leading up to it, during and after. Unfortunately, most of the international events hosted by Moroccan entities get little traction in the influential press and social media, despite the fact that the resources and the budget are hefty. Thus, the failure of this two-track diplomacy to create a buzz on the world stage is incomprehensible. The inability of Moroccan non-government agencies to identify “hot button issues” to deliberate and unfriendly territory to engage calls into question Moroccan parallel diplomacy’s aptitude to respond effectively, consistently and in a scrupulous manner. Three current crisis illustrate these shortcomings. Spain’s’ human rights violations against  Catalan nationalists, Algeria’s kidnaping and murder of Sahrawi leader Ahmed Khalil and England’s’ handling of the issue of border between Northern Ireland and Ireland during the Brexit-EU negotiations are cases that Moroccan civil society should adopt, discuss and highlight. While Morocco’s apathy towards Spain’s harsh crackdown on Catalan nationalists is “understandable”, the complete absence of Moroccan NGOs during Spain’s trial of Catalan separatist leaders in Madrid is shameful and inexcusable. In fact, Spanish NGOs of all political colors keep criticizing Morocco’s human rights record in the Western Sahara while Moroccan entities, including thinks tanks, keep becoming intimidated of addressing Madrid’s gross violations of basic rights in Catalonia. Yet, the failure of Moroccan organizations to publicize Algeria’s role in the kidnaping and killing of  the high ranking leader of Polisario guerilla movement Ahmed Khalil tops the list of recent diplomatic missteps. In the face of indisputable evidence of Algerian involvement in this crime and the constant protests of Sahrawis in the refugee camps in Tindouf denouncing Algerian military extra-judicial killing of one of the tribesman, neither the  Moroccan diplomacy nor the civil society have fully capitalized on this  opportunity to expose the extent of Algiers role in the Western Sahara conflict. A successful parallel diplomacy approach to international relations should not be motivated by a fear of alienating certain nations. To the contrary, it should be based on tackling thorny subjects that the official ministry of foreign affairs cannot “touch”. The fear that certain countries like Spain or United Kingdom could turn against the Moroccan positions in the Western Sahara conflict if a Moroccan entity addresses sensitive internal subjects exposes the basic cultural assumptions that the Moroccan diplomacy is inferior. The kingdom must put at the center of its public relations campaigns activists familiar with the Catalan nationalist agenda, the Northern Ireland conflict,  and the Polisario opposition movements.  Moreover, it needs campaigners who can take the fight to Madrid, London, New York and Geneva. Even though, Morocco dedicated enough money and resources to develop an ambitious foreign policy and to promote a much more assertive international posture, promising results remain to be seen. Therefore, it is time for officials to revise their approach and evaluate the actors behind this falling strategy.

Rabat – The Moroccan Akal Coordination group held a meeting on Sunday to discuss issues with overgrazing and land rights. The group met to consider the latest developments on land and wealth issues. After the meeting, Akal Coordination posted on their Facebook page a report that stated the group “condemns the attempts of political parties to affirm the status quo.” However, the group expected the government would ignore its report, “the same as the previous ones.” Akal organized two protests, in November and February, to protest the government not taking action to prevent overgrazing and wild boars from damaging land. The report declared that Moroccans reject Law 113.13 on pastures. Akal also said people want the parliamentary representatives from all the affected areas to call for an open debate on their demands in light of the “serious and repeated violations.” The law requires shepherds to get a certificate to find grassland for their livestock to graze on certain conditions. The government’s lack of action on complaints that Amazigh (Berber) people have lodged caused Akal to establish a “legal human rights committee.” The committee follows up on the legal and human rights issues related to Akal’s work. The protests called for the return of “usurped lands”—a reference to the Arab invasion of Morocco centuries ago, fair distribution of wealth, and action on the repeated attacks of wild boars. The committee is now preparing a press conference to reach the national and international public, in coordination with Akal’s steering committee.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has decided to withdraw his bid for a fifth term.  The move means Bouteflika is bowing to sustained, unprecedented popular movement against his decision earlier this year to seek reelection. In a statement published by his office earlier today, the president said that there will be “no fifth term.” He stressed his commitment to the country’s good, suggesting his withdrawal was an acknowledgement that reelection would not benefit the country’s interests. “There was never any question of it for me. Given my state of health and age, my last duty towards the Algerian people was always contributing to the foundation of a new Republic,” read part of the statement. In power since 1999, Bouteflika’s earlier years in power brought social peace and economic stability to a war-torn Algeria.  In recent years, however, the ailing president’s perceived inability to effectively run the country incited public fervor against prospective reelection plans.  Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term, which his party announced in February, met with widespread anger and frustration.  The decision to run for a fifth mandate led citizens to rally across the country. March 8 marked the beginning of the third week of demonstrations against Bouteflika. Activists also took to French cities to protest the decision. Bouteflika, who returned home yesterday, spent weeks in Geneva for medical care. Prior to his decision to step down from running in the 2019 election, 1,000 Algerian judges decided to refuse to oversee elections. Having withdrawn his candidacy, the president has announced the postponement of the 2019 election planned for April 18.  He promised an interim and independent leadership structure to organize the prospective elections. A date has not been specified yet. “We announce our intention to abstain from … supervising the election process against the will of the people, which is the only source of power,” the statement  of the judges read.

Rabat – The 2018 Trends in International Arms Transfers report, released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), ranked Algeria among the top five importers of major arms in the world between 2014 and 2018. While Algeria ranked fifth and imports 4.4 percent of the world’s traded arms, the report listed Morocco 24th with a 1.1 percent share of arms imports. Despite the notable difference between Morocco and Algeria, Morocco has gained six places, because it was ranked 30 in the 2017 report of arms transfers. Algeria ranked seventh in the same previous report. The report identified 155 countries as importers of major arms in the 2014-2018 period. The top four importers are India, Australia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. In Africa, arms imports decreased by 6.5 percent from 2009-13 to 2014-18. Morocco accounted for 15 percent of all arms imports in Africa. Meanwhile, Algeria accounted for 56 percent of African imports. Including Libya and Tunisia, the North African countries accounted for 75 percent of African arms imports. While the trend of African arms imports has been on the decline, the four North African countries, according to the report, increased their imports by 20 percent between 2009-13 and 2014-2018. In sub-Saharan Africa, the top five arms importers were Nigeria, Angola, Sudan, Cameroon, and Senegal. The five countries accounted for 56 percent of the arms imports in the region. The US and France, which top the list of major arms exporters, are Morocco’s main suppliers. Morocco received 62 percent of its arms from the US in the period of 2014-2018. France, which is the world’s third largest arms exporter, was the source of 32 percent of the major arms Morocco imported in the same period. Russia, however, remains the top supplier for Algeria, accounting for 66 percent of Algerian arms imports in 2014-2018, compared with 90 percent in 2009-2013. In the 2014-2018 period, Russia delivered a total of 55 percent of its arms exports to India, China, and Algeria. China and Germany are also major arms suppliers for Algeria. In its 2017 world military expenditure report, SIPRI said that Algeria is Africa’s largest importer of military arms because it spend $10 billion for its military, in contrast to Morocco, which spends $3.4 billion. SIPRI added that this was the first decrease in Algeria’s military spending since 2003. A recent report from the Global Firepower Index (GFP) ranked Morocco’s military power 60th globally. The report recalled that Morocco has 1,109 combat tanks, 800 artilleries of three different types, and 2,270 armored fighting vehicles. Algeria ranked second in Africa in the report due to its higher defense budget and lower external debt.

Rabat – Over 1,000 Algerian judges oppose their ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term, adding momentum to the persisting waves of anti-Bouteflika protests in the country. The Algerian judges have shown their rejection of Bouteflika’s re-election campaign by refusing to supervise the country’s elections in April if the president continues to participate. While students, lawyers, and unions have marched in protest and war veterans have expressed support for their calls for Bouteflika to step out of the race, the judges issued a statement yesterday, stressing that they would not go against the people’s wishes. “We announce our intention to abstain from … supervising the election process against the will of the people, which is the only source of power,” the statement read.  The judges’ announcement on Sunday coincided with Bouteflika’s arrival from Switzerland where he had been receiving medical treatment since February. The current waves of demonstrations started on February 22 and are the biggest Algeria has experienced since the Arab Spring in 2011. On Sunday, in addition to the protests in Algeria, thousands of people marched in a demonstration in Paris and in other French cities against Bouteflika’s campaign. Meanwhile, according to Algeria’s state television reports, Algerian Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaid Salah said that the military and the people share a “united vision” of their country’s future, where Bouteflika is not in power. The Algerian people have been expressing that there need to be opportunities for young politicians to run for presidency, instead of Bouteflika prolonging his 20 years in office. On Sunday, March 3, Bouteflika released a statement addressing the protests and offering to step down after a year if he is re-elected for a fifth term in the April 18 election. This only further angered the protesters, who increased in numbers.  Last Friday, March 8, Algeria witnessed a mass protest across the country with the participation of women on the occasion of International Women’s Day. Authorities suspended train services and arrested 195 protesters who they said were looting.

By Katya Schwenk Rabat – New footage of the conditions Moroccan female workers face harvesting strawberries in Spain aired Sunday on the acclaimed Spanish news series “Salvados.” The episode, hosted by Jordi Evole, investigated the plight of seasonal migrants for the week of International Women’s Day. In interviews, Moroccan women described foul, overcrowded living conditions; sexual abuse at the hands of their supervisors; and long, irregular hours. “Do you know that in Spain we celebrate International Working Women’s Day?” Evole asked one Moroccan worker. “Will you protest or strike?” “If there’s fruit, we always work, holiday or no holiday,” she answered, after Évole explained to her what the word for strike—huelga—meant. Each year, Spanish strawberry and berry farms recruit tens of thousands of female Moroccan workers through Morocco’s national employment agency, ANAPEC. Spain announced in January that over 19,000 Moroccan women would travel to pick strawberries in the Huelva province for the 2019 season. The first group of workers for the year sailed out from the port of Tangier on February 1 and will return to Morocco in June. The workers are all married women with children, per government requirements intended to prevent visa overstays. And though demand has grown in Morocco for the seasonal labor jobs, workers have long complained of abuse and exploitative conditions on Spanish berry farms. Last year, four female workers accused a supervisor on a Huelva farm of sexual assault, leading to widespread media coverage. In response, the Spanish judiciary opened an investigation into the case, and the Moroccan government promised new measures to support its seasonal workers in Spain. But Sunday’s new footage makes it plain that conditions for Moroccan workers remain perilous. Aintzane Marquez, a lawyer for the women’s rights organization WomenLink, showed  a video she obtained from Spanish news agency El Pais to “Salvados” that depicts squalid showers filled with sand and insects as well as overcrowded housing. Most women live on or directly adjacent to the farms, Marquez said, isolating them from local communities. They often work late into the evenings or are not informed of their working hours in advance. In a clip from the episode, one woman described the life as “work, slavery, and suffering.” Marquez said that the conditions do not match the information companies gave workers on living standards before their employment. She is currently representing four Moroccan women who have filed legal complaints against the farms. Several women spoke to Evole about sexual assault on the farms, describing a long-term pattern of abuse with few avenues for recourse. One woman alleged that a supervisor demanded she sleep with him or he would not allow her to work. “The boss thinks he has a right to it,” said a woman that Evole interviewed. “Look, we’re going back to the Middle Ages.” Still, demand for seasonal labor jobs continues to grow in Morocco, particularly in the underemployed city of Oujda in the northeast. Last year, 2,500 Moroccan seasonal workers declared their intent to stay in Spain, despite efforts by both governments to maximize return. For many women, the work offers a rare lifeline out of poverty for them and their children, regardless of the risks.

Rabat – The secretary-general of the Moroccan Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), Hakim Benchamach, has criticized the government, led by the Justice and Development Party (PJD), accusing it of stifling progress and development in Morocco.  He said the government has prevented Morocco from catching up to developing countries by “mismanaging public affairs.” In a meeting PAM called on Saturday, March 9, in Rabat, Benchamach stated that the PJD-led coalition government has failed to invest in the many opportunities Morocco has enjoyed under the 2011 Constitution to achieve development and progress, reported Moroccan news outlet Al Ahdath. Benchamach accused the PJD of “conning” Moroccans when it promised to attain “7 percent development,” despite national and international financial institutions saying the figure was completely unattainable. According to PAM, Benchamach also argued the PJD-led government deluded Moroccans and could not deliver what it promised to achieve in development by fighting corruption. This failure, he elaborated, is reflected in the growing social tensions expressed in street protests and the disgruntlement of citizens. The PJD rose to power in 2011, but came to a crisis in 2017 when months after the election, it failed to form a majority government, the first such stalemate in Moroccan history. King Mohammed VI appointed then foreign minister Saad Eddine El Othmani as head of government, replacing Abdelilah Benkirane. El Othmani formed a government with four other parties.

Rabat – The Conference of University Presidents (CPU) has said Moroccan schools should not teach science in Arabic, weighing into the intensifying political debate on which language should be used to teach science in Morocco. While some scholars, teachers, and politicians prefer Arabic as a language of instruction, others believe that French and English should be given preference in teaching science. On March 8, the CPU issued a statement on the question. CPU acknowledged the recent increase of debates in Morocco on the language of instruction at schools. “The debate crystallizes and intensifies on the language of science in primary and secondary education.” In universities, however, the question of teaching scientific and technical subjects in Arabic does not arise, because they are taught in French. The statement also remarks that Moroccan universities are increasingly seeing initiatives to introduce English as a language of instruction for science. The CPU, representing all Moroccan universities, warned that students in public schools are experiencing a “real linguistic divide between high school and university.” French, English must be used in primary, secondary schools While students in Morocco study science in Arabic from primary school to high school, they study the same subjects in French in universities. Students who attended government schools, therefore, find it difficult to keep up with courses in French at universities. The CPU finds it unfair for students from public schools and is urging for primary, secondary, and high schools to use foreign languages in teaching science to bridge the divide. The CPU argued that 30 percent of students with baccalaureate science degrees have to pursue non-science majors because of the language barrier. While acknowledging the importance of Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) in Morocco, CPU said that “technology, science, and knowledge are produced in foreign languages, especially English and French.” “It is not possible, in the current situation to have mastery of information, digitization, artificial intelligence, and technologies related to aviations, cars, and energies without being able to use these languages.” Get young people ready for world’s expectations The statement emphasized the need to prepare future generations to cope with the rapid development of professions, of which it said “80 percent” will be evolving in the near future. Decades after independence from France, the French language is still dominant in Morocco. Some Moroccans are angry French is still the dominant foreign language, believing that English should take its place. Moroccan scholar Abderrahim Elalam told Morocco World News that English is emerging in Morocco. Elalame noted that students now go to language centers to learn English. The scholar, however, acknowledged that it would be difficult for Morocco to shift completely towards English. In January, Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that English cannot replace French as a language of instruction for at least another 10 years because of a lack of teachers. 
The CPU concluded that it recommends the “teaching of science subjects in French at all levels of education and training, all by setting up the necessary conditions for teaching these subjects also in English.”

Rabat – Morocco lost two citizens in the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 crash yesterday. One of them was Dr. Ben Ahmed Chihab, sometimes known as Ahmed Chihab, the regional director of environment from the Draa Tafilalet region in eastern Morocco. After studying at the Moulay Youssef High School in Rabat, Chihab went to France to continue his studies. He studied at University of Bordeaux-Montaigne. He then pursued a degree in quaternary geology at the University of Bordeaux 1. Chihab specialized in the geology of biodiversity and ecological issues. In 2001, Chihab was the head of site services responsible for the Cartagena Protocol Focal Point in the Department of the Environment at the Moroccan Ministry of Regional Planning, Environment, Housing, and Urban Planning. In 2007, Chihab took part in several events including the International Day for Biological Diversity at the National Institute of Planning and Development (INAU), Rabat.  In 2008, he represented Morocco at the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in Bonn, Germany.  Chihab also contributed to Morocco’s Fourth National Report on Biological Diversity in 2009. The biologist was on his way to Nairobi to attend a meeting under the Convention on Biodiversity. Learning about Chihab’s death in the tragic ET 302 plane crash, many public figures sent their condolence online to his family, including energy minister Aziz Rabbah. “The ministry of energy … has lost one of its managers,” the minister said on his official Facebook page. The crash of the Boeing 737 Max-8 has sparked a debate about the Boeing model that came onto the market in 2017.  The crash was the second to happen on that model. In October, Lion Air flight 610, operating on a Max-8, plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia. In response to the second crash, China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia have ordered their airlines to ground the Max-8 aircraft. Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) received its first Boeing 737 Max-8 in December. RAM has indefinitely suspended use of all Boeing 737 Max-8 planes as of today.  Last month, a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by RAM and heading to Tunisia made an emergency landing in Algeria after thick, white smoke came out of its air vents. Two Moroccan citizens lost their lives on the Ethiopian Airlines flight when it crashed six minutes after it took off from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The crash claimed the lives of all 157 people onboard, including Ben Ahmed Chihab and fellow Moroccan El Hassan Sayouty.

Rabat – The 4th UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) opened today in an atmosphere of grief after yesterday’s Ethiopian Airlines plane crash. The crash killed all 157 people on board the plane, including 22 UN delegates who were heading to the conference, two of whom were Moroccans.  At the start of the meeting, the assembly observed several minutes of silence for their colleagues who had been on the Addis Ababa-Narobi flight. The two Moroccan delegates were El Hassan Sayouty, a professor at Hassan II University in Casablanca, and Chihab Ben Ahmed, a regional director for the environment of Morocco’s eastern Draa-Tafilalet region. Following the crash, Morocco’s national carrier Royal Air Maroc indefinitely suspended use of all Boeing 737 Max-8 planes, the plane involved in the crash. Ethiopia, the Cayman Islands, and China have also temporarily suspended use of their Max 8s while awaiting an investigation into the cause of the crash. More than 4,700 heads of states, ministers, civil society representatives, and business leaders gathered today in Nairobi to discuss ways to solve many environmental challenges and to accelerate sustainable development. Prominent world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, are attending the conference. Morocco’s delegation is being led by the secretary of state for sustainable development, Nezha El Ouafi.  The conference, which will continue until March 15, is themed: “Innovative Solutions for Environmental Challenges and Sustainable Consumption and Production.” It is the biggest gathering in the assembly’s history. The assembly is also hosting side events and exhibits to provide an opportunity for attendees to “form partnerships and make deals that benefit people and the environment.”

Rabat- TasteAtlas, a website that categorizes the best dishes from around the world, has ranked the tagine 34th in the world’s most popular dishes.  TasteAtlas, launched late last year, has compiled 10,000 traditional dishes, beverages, and ingredients from the around the world in its database.  The website has over 30 Moroccan dishes in its database, with classics such as couscous, pastilla (savory pies), and harira soup included, as well as dishes that may not be as well-known internationally such as seffa (a sweet and savory vermicelli noodle dish) and loubia (a zesty white bean stew).  It was tagine that ranked more popular than any Moroccan other dish listed, however, ranking 34th in the World’s Top 100 dishes on TasteAtlas’ list. The website praises tagine for the method of slow cooking that makes the vegetables “buttery” with meat that “falls of the bone.”  There are many different options of how to cook a tagine and an endless variety of possible ingredients, and TasteAtlas lauds the dish for representing well Morocco’s “affinity for combining different textures and mixing flavors.” Popular options include chicken and olives, lamb and prune, mussels and tomato, and vegetarian tagines with as many as 7 or 8 different vegetables.  TasteAtlas aptly describes the tagine as a “national dish full of creativity and flavor.” It also lists 17 restaurants where customers will find the best tagine “in the world.” Their number one recommendation is Al Fassia in Marrakech, a famed Moroccan restaurant that has been running for over 25 years.   Morocco’s love for the tagine goes back far in history. The name tagine refers to the pot it is cooked in, which has a fluted cone top to allow for the release of steam. The shape of the pot ensures the dish is as tender as possible.   Although the origin of the tagine is much debated, with some believing the Phoenicians introduced the tagine to Morocco in the 12th century and others believing the Amazigh (Berber) nomads invented the tagine, using it as a portable oven.   Either way, the tagine is without a doubt a national treasure of Morocco and an indelible part of the country’s history and culture.

Rabat – Tetouan judicial police have arrested two suspects, a repeat offender and his accomplice, a 16-year-old boy, caught in a vehicle with 6,000 Rivotril tablets. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) issued a statement about the arrests on Sunday.  Rivotril, also called clonazepam, is used as a sedative to decrease seizures or anxiety. The continuous use of Rivotril might lead its users to experience a dramatic personality change, either a form of explosive anger or inability to feel deep emotion such as happiness or sadness. The medicine is only available legally with a doctor’s prescription. After searching a house, the police seized another car and a large sum of money, which the DGSN said was the proceeds from the suspect’s illegal. Police placed the adult suspect in custody pending the completion of the investigation and the minor under police surveillance.

Rabat – A plane carrying President Abdelaziz Bouteflika landed in Algeria yesterday. The 2019 election candidate had been in Geneva for medical care. Bouteflika’s plane landed in Algeria in the midst of weeks of protests, involving both adults and minors, who have been condemning Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth mandate for more than two weeks now. March 8 marked the beginning of the third week of protests with hundreds of thousands of Algerians taking to the streets calling for Bouteflika to remove himself as a candidate in the election. Under pressure from protesters, the government ordered the shutdown of universities across the country ahead of a scheduled holiday, according to Al Jazeera. Algeria’s Ministry of Education did not explain the decision, announcing that the spring holiday would start 10 days earlier than before. Throughout the weeks of protests, which erupted on February 22, students have been on the street to lead peaceful demonstrations. In addition to the protests in Algeria, thousands of people marched in a demonstration in Paris and in other French cities on Sunday against Bouteflika’s campaign. Rachid Nekkaz, a well-known businessman opposing Bouteflika, attended the Paris protest. On Friday, Swiss police arrested Nekkaz when he attempted to check on Bouteflika’s health situation at the Geneva University Hospital. A police spokesperson, Joanna Matta, said that the hospital filed a complaint against Nekkaz for trespassing. In an interview with France 24 yesterday, Nekkaz said that every Algerian has the right to know the president’s health status, and the government should not keep it a secret. Other people also protested in front of the Geneva University Hospital. Speaking at the gathering, Nekkaz said there are “40 million Algerians who want to know where the president is.” The Algerian-French businessman had attempted to submit his candidacy for presidency. Nekkaz complained that the Constitutional Council refused his candidacy because he holds French citizenship. In response, the businessman renounced his French citizenship and had his cousin of the same name submit his candidacy.

Rabat – Morocco’s national carrier, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has indefinitely suspended use of all Boeing 737 Max-8 planes as of today. On Sunday, Flight ET 302, a Boeing 737 Max-8 plane on its way to Nairobi, crashed six minutes after it took off from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing all 157 people onboard. Royal Air Maroc (RAM) received its first Boeing 737 Max-8 in December, and the airplane has been operating since January 1 on trips to Barcelona, Paris, and London. RAM received its second Max-8 in mid-February. The company expects soon to receive two other Boeing 737 Max-8s. RAM did not specify how long it will suspend the use of the new airplanes while it awaits the results of investigations into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Ethiopia, the Cayman Islands, and China have also ordered their airlines to temporarily suspend use of their Boeing 737 Max-8 planes, especially because the same plane model crashed in a recent accident. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed near Jakarta, also only minutes after take-off, killing all 189 people onboard. The cause of the crash is still under investigation. Ethiopian Airlines announced that the 157 victims on flight ET 302 included 2 Moroccans, 6 Egyptians, 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, and 8 Americans.

Rabat – The US State Department has expressed appreciation for Morocco’s decision to repatriate eight Moroccans allegedly involved in terrorism from the conflict zone in Syria. On Sunday, the department said, “Morocco is a highly capable partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and we appreciate its commitment to countering terrorism.” The department continued, “Morocco’s actions should encourage other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who have traveled to fight for ISIS.” The statement emphasized that repatriation is the “best solution to prevent” terrorists from returning to the battlefield. On Sunday, Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior announced the repatriation of eight Moroccans from Syria. According to the ministry, the operation is part of the authorities’ contributions to international efforts to fight terrorism.

In September 2018, the State Department’s Country Reports on Terrorism asserted that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” Morocco’s anti-terrorism strategy After  the 2003 terror attacks in Casablanca and 2011 attack in Marrakech, the Moroccan government announced a  new security service, the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), in 2015. Since then, BCIJ has dismantled multiple terror cells and arrested hundreds of terrorist suspects. The security service also cooperates with international intelligence, assisting Spain in tracking terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad. Morocco’s other security bodies, the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), also collaborate in fighting terrorism. “Law enforcement officials and private carriers worked regularly with the United States to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally to address watchlisted or mala fide travelers,” said the State Department report. A Moroccan delegation, headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, traveled to Washington, D.C., in February to take part in the  ministerial meetings for the Coalition to Defeat ISIS. At the meeting, Bourita said that Morocco has put in place a unique and recognized approach to countering radicalization and terrorists. Morocco implemented training programs at the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams to disseminate the values of Islam and fight radical ideologies. Bourita also recalled Morocco’s reconciliation programs to prevent the spread of violent extremism in prison.

Rabat – Police in Casablanca arrested a 33-year old woman for alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a six year old girl. The young girl’s family resorted to security services after their daughter disappeared under mysterious circumstances last Monday while playing with her bicycle in front of her house in the old medina of Casablanca. Police found the girl on Saturday. Police identified the suspect with camera recordings in which the suspect appears with the kidnapped girl in several areas of the city of Casablanca. Police put the suspects in custody as they continue their ongoing investigation to identify the circumstances of the incident. In February, Morocco’s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) found a three-year old girl in Fkih Ben Saleh in the Khenifra region after she had allegedly been kidnapped. In recent years, several very young girls have been reported missing or kidnapped in Morocco. Some were abducted but eventually found and returned safely to their families while others have either remained missing or were found dead. In September, another 5-year-old girl named Khadija, was found after she went missing from a souk in Casablanca. Moroccans shared pictures of her on social media to help find her.

Rabat – Though the exact date of the arrival of Islam to the Maghreb region remains in question, by the year 788 CE, the religion had spread to large areas of Morocco at the hands of the Shi’ite Idrisid dynasty, which had come to power and had begun to form “the nucleus of a petty state” with the aid of Amazigh tribes (Peyron, 82).  Islam spread and manifested itself in Amazigh societies following several waves of Arab invasions and power shifts through several Arab and Amazigh dynasties, meaning  that Islam as it was practiced among the Amazigh people became unique to Morocco.  The subsequent dynasties promoted Islam among the tribes in such a way that allowed Islam to gain a stronger foothold among the Amazigh people more than the previous invaders. he Islam that came to be practiced in different Amazigh societies took on elements of heterodoxy and more mystical manifestations than had previously been allowed by more purist and orthodox Islamic caliphates. It has historically been argued that one of the strongest factors which enabled Islam to gain a strong following among the native Amazigh population was its appeal as an austere and unadorned faith whose central tenets are easily accessible to the average person living with ordinary struggles.  This argument, however, fails to allow for the fact that Islam as it was conceived and practiced by dynasties such as the Almoravids, an Amazigh dynasty that ruled much of the region from around 1040-1147 CE, was often purist and strictly orthodox and often clashed with the traditional practices of the Amazigh population. Indeed, much of the early Muslim governance in North Africa espoused an Islam that appealed to the population centered in urban areas, many of whom were elite and learned.   This rendered the religion obscure to those who could neither read nor write in the tribal areas. Religion as it was manifested among these tribes was required “not as a form of scholarship and contemplation, but as an alleviation of suffering, as a more drastic alternative to ordinary life” (Gellner, 8). This was because a strict and orthodox interpretation was satisfying to those with the education, time and patience for such practices, but to the lower classes, whose lives were defined by turbulent warfare, stronger bonds of kinship with their fellow tribesmen, and the harshness of life in isolated areas, the religion needed to manifest itself in a more emotional context. To achieve this, Amazigh tribes often combined the traditional pillars of Islam with their heterodoxical, pre-Islamic practices and rituals. This meant that the Islam which emerged was more in the vein of Sufi mysticism than orthodox Sunnism.  In many villages and towns isolated from the urban areas, tribes established zawiyas, or brotherhood lodges, where they further promoted Islam while fostering a deep kinship among its adherents. Zawiyas were neither standardized nor always orthodox and each established its own doctrine typically centered around the vision of a founding member who, upon death, was often made a saint in Sufi tradition.  It was at these zawiyas that members learned Islamic theology and doctrine even while interpreting that doctrine in ways that were unique to them. In this way, members could take ownership of their faith and personalize an otherwise rigid and inaccessible belief system. Even today, the Islam embraced by those in isolated and rural areas of Morocco is less rigid in practice and ideology than the Sunni Islam widely practiced across the Middle East (Norris, 54).  In a similar fashion, there are even many Amazigh people  who have outright rejected the Islamic faith all together, choosing to hold onto their traditional roots, or to accept other religions such as Christianity, as a way to maintain an identity separate from their Arab conquerors.  Further complicating this identity crisis was the fact that during the period of French colonization, starting in 1912, the occupying French used Christianity as a means through which to drive a wedge between Arab and Amazigh populations in order to consolidate French power in the region (Redouane, 198).  Though a few pockets of the Amazigh people had embraced Christianity before the arrival of the French, the French colonial legacy—which was built on leveraging the power of certain ethnic groups and religions over others—gave way to a more complex, multi-faceted, and multi-religious society than the one which had previously existed before the onset of colonization.  Such rejection of Islamic doctrine in an Islamic state has not been without controversy and many Amazigh people have felt compelled to leave modern Morocco in order to freely practice their faith (or non-faith) without the restrictions imposed upon them by an Islamic government (Redouane, 199).  The vast majority of the modern Imazighen continue to consider themselves as followers of Islam, despite their multidimensional and sometimes unorthodox interpretations. Between the austere doctrines of Islam as it was originally practiced by the early dynasties and the burdens  of modern life in the era of globalization and modernity, the Moroccan Amazigh people have adopted and developed an Islam that is most adaptable and suited to the needs of their everyday life.  Though more rigidly ideological adherents to the faith as well as modern theological states may consider these adaptations to be heretical and antithetical to Islam, the fact remains that these interpretative manifestations of Islam allowed the religion to be dynamic, and to retain staying power in a turbulent and shifting society. Without toleration of these interpretations, as well as an allowance of more heterodox practices, Islam might never have come to dominate the Maghreb region and might never have had such a lasting and strong influence on the people it touched.

Rabat – The five most representative unions in the education sector have announced their refusal to the contractual teachers’ situation reform proposed by the ministry of education. The unions reiterated that the only solution to end the ongoing contractual teachers’ protests is by their integration into public sector employment. The declarations come a day after the ministry announced a reform stating that contractual teachers will benefit from health care, pensions fund, early retirement in case of a permanent sickness, and the right to promotions to posts with greater responsibilities. The unions have issued a joint statement in which they stick to their demand to have contractual teachers integrated into the public sector.  They also called on the government to open a real dialogue that will result in the integration of the contractors into the regular program of the ministry of education employees alike their colleagues, the permanent teachers. The statement added that the unions are aware of the sensitivity of the phase that the sector is experiencing and accuses the government of procrastinating regarding opening a dialogue with the contractual teachers. The unions believe the government proposed reform does not change the contractors’ situation as it keeps them hired within the regional academies and not among the regular employees of the ministry of education.  On the instructions of the head of government, the minister of education, vocational training, and higher education, Said Amzazi, announced the reform during a meeting with the five most representative unions in the education sector.

Rabat – 19-year-old Malak al-Kashef, who recently had sex reassignment surgery, has not been heard from ever since she was taken by the Egyptian national security at the early morning hours of March 6. After police raided her house and forcibly took her, she was reportedly taken to an “undisclosed location.”  Police denied they have her their custody. Human rights organization Amnesty International warned that al-Kashef may be at risk of torture and violence given Egypt’s animosity towards the Egyptian LGBT community. “Egyptian authorities have a horrific track record of persecuting people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, including through carrying out forced anal examinations which amount to torture,” explained Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. Amnesty has vehemently denounced Egypt’s treatment of the LGBT community, writing on their website and on social media on March 7, “Dozens of people have been arrested in recent days over anti-government protests relating to last week’s train crash that killed at least 25 people and injured many others. At least 32 people remain in pre-trial detention over unfounded charges relating to the peaceful expression of their opinions.” Al-Kashef was detained on the grounds that she has joined a “terrorist group” and leveraging social media to disrupt “public order.” The organization presumes she was also detained as a result of her call for peaceful protests following the deadly train accident. From the closet to the prison cell Malak felt gender dysphoria from an early age. She felt female but was trapped in a male body.  Malak has made appearances in the media in the past and has been a staunch proponent of LGBT rights in a country where one’s sexual orientation that does not comply with the “normative heterosexuality” is considered deviant.  “Deviant” gender identities must be shrouded in secrecy. Otherwise, such identities will run the risk of being ostracized from society. Al-kashef left home because her family outright rejected her. She said, “they were afraid of society.” She has contemplated suicide several times. She once jumped off the fifth floor in a failed suicide attempt and ended up sustaining three severe double fractures at the level of her pelvis and left arm, which, she elaborated, will high unlikely “function the way it normally did.” In an interview with Erem News agency, she recounted her first realization: “At the age of nine, I realized that I had [gender dysphoria], but I was clueless as to what it was called or that there is what is now known as ‘transexuality’ or ‘gender identity disorder’.” Statistics conducted by a gender clinic in the Netherlands shows that there is 1 male to female transgender in every 11,000 persons and 1 female to male in every 30,400 persons.

Rabat – Morocco’s ministry of higher education has announced it will abolish the contractual employment of teachers for a fixed term and proposed instead to hire them permanently within the regional academies. The ministry published a statement on Saturday stating that the contractual teachers will enjoy all the rights like the permanent teachers employed by the government but within the regional academies with whom they initially signed the contract. On the instructions of the head of government, the minister of education, vocational training, and higher education Said Amzazi made the announcement during a meeting with the five most representative unions in the education sector. The contract program will be reformed as the contractual teachers will get medical care, pensions, and the same labor protections as permanent teachers. The reform will not only grant contractual teachers the right to internal promotion in grades throughout their career but also early retirement in cases of a serious disease. If they fulfill the requirements, they will also benefit from the right of passing exams to be inspectors, and also to be part of the administrative or the educational orientation body. The government also proposed that contractual teachers will have the opportunity to take on greater responsibilities such as heads of departments, heads of division and even provincial director positions. Contractual teachers began a “six-day regional sit-in” across the country accompanied by a “national strike” on Monday, February 4. The protests started February 18-20, when hundreds of contractors took to the streets to denounce the government’s “disregard” for their needs, “poor” social dialogue negotiations, problems in education and healthcare, and the deterioration of their situation.

Rabat – On Sunday Moroccan authorities repatriated a group of eight Moroccans, who were in conflict zones in Syria. A statement from the Ministry of Interior said that the operation is part of the authorities’ contributions to international efforts to fight terrorism. According to the ministry, the repatriation is of a humanitarian nature and will allow Moroccan nationals to return to their country of origin in complete safety. The returnees, according to the ministry, will be the subject of judicial investigations for their alleged involvement in terror-related activities. The Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame estimates 1,668 Moroccans joined ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. The BCIJ chief added that Moroccan intelligence has detailed files on each one of the suspects in conflict zones. BCIJ staff arrested 71 ISIS returnees between 2015 and 2016. The majority of the suspects had come from conflict zones in Syria and Iraq. Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. Morocco has also implemented a set of programs to counter terrorism and extremism, including the “moussalaha” or reconciliation program, launched in 2018. Launched by the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), the program aims to reintegrate jihadis into society. The program involves human rights experts and anti-radicalization experts who provide psychological support and rehabilitation to defendants charged and jailed for terror crimes.  In addition to the moussalaha program, Morocco also adopts an approach to combat terrorism locally and internationally. Morocco’s role in countering radicalization and terrorists has been touted in several reports. In the 2018 terrorism index, Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. The report showcases that Morocco has two strategies to deal with foreign fighter returnees: Deradicalization programs and imprisonment.

Rabat – An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed today, with 149 passengers and eight crew members onboard. The Boeing 737 flight, which was headed to Nairobi, crashed a few minutes after it took off from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The Airline shared a statement to confirm that its flight was involved in an accident. The statement added that search and rescue operations are in progress. “We have no confirmed information about survivors or any possible casualties.” The statement added that the company’s staff will head to the spot of the accident “and will do everything possible to assist the emergency services.” The statement said that the flight took off at 8:38 a.m. local time from Addis Ababa. The company added that it will release further information as soon as it is available. “Ethiopian Airlines is establishing a passenger information center and telephone number will be available shortly for family or friends of those who may have been on” the flight. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed gave his condolences to the families of the victims.

Rabat – Saad Eddine El Othmani, the leader of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), has lashed out at Abdelilah Benkirane, the PJD’s former head, for what the party sees as inconsiderate public statements. Appearing to distance himself from Benkirane on a number of issues, El Othmani suggested during a party meeting on Wednesday that his predecessor is no longer a legitimate representative of the PJD. In a number of statements made in recent weeks, Benkirane attacked education minister Saaid Amzazi, who is pushing for a legislative reform seeking to teach high school scientific subjects in French. The former PJD leader said that maintaining Arabic should be the priority of any government that wants to secure Morocco’s future. “Arabic is crucial for the future of Morocco,” he said. Benkirane also recently attacked agriculture minister Aziz Akhannouch for suggesting that recent reforms in Morocco were initiated under the auspices of King Mohammed VI, rather than by Benkirane who has claimed that he was the driving force behind the reforms. Akhannouch is a member of the center-right National Rally of Independent (RNI) party, PJD’s most serious political rival. Of the two RNI ministers, Benkirane said they are “weak leaders from whom Moroccans should not be expecting anything.” In response to Benkirane’s comments, El Othmani said that the former PJD leader was speaking in his own name, rather than on behalf of the party. “Benkirane spoke for himself,” El Othmani said, noting that Benkirane’s statements should be taken as those of a simple citizen voicing his concern, rather than as coming from a political leader. Benkirane, El Othmani noted, “has no political or organizational power to apply his ideas.” According to Moroccan daily Al Akhbar, the party’s clarification was meant to show that despite having a relatively considerable number of loyals within the ranks of a party he led for years, Benkirane is increasingly losing political relevance. The former PM remains a PJD mogul, and it is unclear whether the majority of the party leadership is keen on ostracizing him, or making him redundant in the country’s political debate. What remains certain, however, according to Al Akhbar, is that many in the PJD want to protect the party from the Benkirane’s tendency towards impulsive statements. Benkirane has a history of explosive public statements. In January, he incurred the ire of Tunisians for making “insulting and undiplomatic” comments on the North African country’s political culture. Commenting on Tunisia’s “continuous general strikes,” Benkirane said that the North African country is an “undisciplined and socially unstable country,” despite having a relatively robust democracy. In response, many Tunisians said he should “shut up” and attend to his own concerns.

Rabat – As she faces a barrage of criticism for failing to uphold her party’s “Islamic values,” Amina Maelainine refuses to succumb to critics. Hitting back at her “detractors” in a lengthy profile article published earlier today Moroccan weekly Al Ayyam, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) MP said that the Hijab is not an essential part of Islam. Maelainine rose to political prominence as an articulated and outspoken proponent of female modesty in accordance with what she saw as Islamic principles. Now, though, the PJD MP says she had been mistaken because she used to “disproportionately” consider physical appearance as central in experiencing one’s faith. “The veil is not an Islamic pillar,” Maelainine said, in reference to the five precepts, or “Islamic pillars,” that constitute the cornerstone of the Muslim faith. For an MP whose political speeches used to make effusive references to the virtues of devout female believers as she represented a party whose base is adamant on upholding the precepts of one’s faith in public life and government practices, Maelainine’s comments can come across as surprising. Aware of the implications of her statements, however, Maelainine sought to clarify. She said that some Islamic precepts are compulsory, whereas others stem from personal choices and are subject to circumstances. She elaborated, “Being naked does not have the same social significance in tropical Africa, the Middle East, or Latin America. These are relative questions that should not be approached through the lenses of an absolute.” At the heart of Maelainine logic is the desire to refrain from judging others’ lifestyles. She said that clothing reflects a “social contract” binding an individual to centuries of social conventions, the result of historical and cultural considerations. “I know some leading PJD members who are very open on the question of the Hijab. Their stances are indeed very liberal. But they can’t openly express their ideas because of party and social constraints.” Maelainine evoked the context in which she took up the Hijab, referring to early high school years in which judgment is sometimes clouded by unquestioned allegiance to scriptures she did not fully grasp. She implied it is easy to espouse militant attitude toward faith when one knows very little. When she was in high school and decided to wear the hijab, she considered it as the “essence of religion.” In those early years, she explained, “We tended to accord disproportionate importance to the veil and clothes in general.” But many things have changed, Maelainine seemed to suggest. A philosophy graduate—and teacher— who had the chance to encounter classic texts on faith and community, the MP said she now knows that questions like physical appearance and clothing choices “are trivial.” The most pressing concern for an Islamist government or leader should be good policy making to solve societal issues, rather than judgmental attitudes on people’s life choices, according to Maelainine. She revealed that being bearded or refraining from greeting women were “essential considerations” for PJD male members in the party’s early years. Now, however, “one can hardly imagine a [PJD] minister giving importance to such trivialities, at the expense of solving his department’s problems.” More than ethical, religious considerations on what to wear and how not to behave in public, Maelainine also expressed her “liberal take” on the experience of faith. Faith, she said, should entirely be a personal matter. The country does not need custodians to dictate on people what they should believe. “I think that freedom of conscience should be guaranteed for everyone.” For all the conciliatory underpinning of Maelainine’s philosophy-inspired comments, her change from an ardent supporter of the hijab  to a heartfelt proponent of hijab-free expression of faith and public decency has personal motivations. She herself is currently fighting with mounting criticism from within the lower and upper echelons of her own party. In early January, pictures of an unveiled Maelainine in Paris made the rounds on Moroccan social media. Critics—Moroccan liberals in great number—slammed both Maelainine and her party for thriving on “the credulity of the Moroccan electorate.” The idea was that the PJD capitalizes on “Islamic ethics as a political market,” with MPs that publically exhibit Islam-saturated public personae that clash with their personal lives. Critics said that the PJD’s “hypocritical” MPs use religion to only appeal to the country’s largely conservative populations. Maelainine first denied the authenticity of the pictures. She claimed the images were “fake and fabricated” and were only meant to defame her, ruin her political career. She even threatened to sue the authors of the “smear campaign.” Following more leakages, however, the MP acknowledged that the pictures were real. But she remained as unrepentant. She declared that her convictions as a political representative and fighter for “democracy, justice, and human rights” far outweigh her attire choices or her public appearance in general. Maelainine has since been at the heart of a party dispute. While some PJD members have voiced their support for the besieged MP, others, including party leader and head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani, have said that she had no right to take off her hijab while in Paris. Referring to that episode in her interview with Al Ayyam, Maelainine said she has “no regrets” over her recent choices. However, she explained, she was “pained” that her PJD “brothers and sisters” who should have come to her rescue chose to lambast her instead. “I cannot accept that my personality and political fights be reduced to my clothing choices,” she said.

Rabat – During a meeting with Moroccan pharmacists on Thursday,  Head of Government El Othmani discussed the issue of toxic medical drugs imported from China, India, and Egypt and sold in Morocco’s black market. El Othmani stressed that the expired medicinal products pose a growing concern in the country for their threats on the health of sick people who seek them. He pledged to personally be in charge of the fight against such products. El Othmani said that he will send a letter to the minister of interior, Abdelouafi Laftit, and the minister of health, Anas Doukkali, and urge them to collaborate on the monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The head of government informed pharmacists who complained about the circulation of toxic paramedical products. He said he has already requested Laftit to accelerate the crackdown on smuggled and expired drugs and ban their access to the Moroccan market.  Morocco has recently lead a crackdown on toxic medical drugs. In January, the prefectural police in Oujda in northeast Morocco closed two workshops manufacturing and selling toxic paramedical products. The police confiscated 7.5 tons of raw material and already manufactured paramedical products in addition to lab equipment in one of the workshops owned by the same person.

Rabat – Moroccans and U.S. citizens in Washington D.C. will celebrate Morocco’s culture and history in an event dedicated to Morocco. The event will take place every March for the next 12 yeas. The symposium is the result of a decision from the mayor of Washington D.C., Muriel Bowser, who declared March 29 “Morocco Day” to celebrate the North African country’s culture and diversity. Dedicated to creating opportunities for small businesses, the Moroccan American Network shared a statement to express pride in the mayor’s decision to declare March 29 as Morocco Day. The statement said that the symposium is symbolic as it “represents an opportunity for US decision makers and American citizens to learn about Morocco as a country of diversity and a haven for security and safety.” The statement also recalled that Morocco was the first country in the world to recognize the independence of the U.S. in 1777. The symposium will display the unique heritage of Morocco and its contributions to the world, as well as its culture and history. CEO of AVA Actions, Mohammed Hajjam, told Morocco World News that Morocco Day is a “symbolic gesture from D.C. to honor Morocco and Moroccan-Americans. We have a road map for 12 regions and we have a great team to do this in next 12 years.” He added that the initiative is a “great idea to know us Moroccan-Americans and Morocco better.” According to the network, Morocco Day will also serve as an opportunity to discuss investment in all regions of the country. The first annual iteration of Morocco Day will emphasize the importance of small Moroccan enterprises and their American counterparts through a round table that will convene entrepreneurs from the two countries. The symposium will include field trips, including meetings with senior officials, Moroccan academics, and businessmen. The recognition of Morocco Day, according to the statement, is the result  of an initiative from several Morocco-American business owners, journalists, university professors and human rights advocates who are members of the Moroccan American network. In addition to the business element, the event will also discuss culture, diversity, and religion, allowing American citizens to learn about Morocco’s efforts to encourage peace and coexistence among different religions. The Moroccan American Network also expressed its intent to celebrate the twelve regions of Morocco through a medium-term program. The program aims to honor each region individually in the next 12 years. This year’s version will celebrate the city of Zagora in the Souss-Massa-Draa region in southeastern Morocco. The region is surrounded by palaces and fortresses, called ksours and kasbahs, which attract local and international tourists. The declaration of the mayor of Washington D.C., according to the statement, is “only the first step in a long and ambitious journey to strengthen Morocco’s position in the United States of America.” The network also noted that every June 9, the American city of Alexandria celebrates Morocco in an event sponsored by the Moroccan American Network. The list of guests invited to the Morocco Day on March 29 includes: Mohamed El Gherrass, state secretary for vocational training, Moroccan singer Nouaman Lahlou, Abderrahim Chahid, president of the Provincial Council of Zagora, Justin Wilson, mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, and David Hamod, CEO of the National US-Arab Chamber of Commerce.

Rabat – The 2019 Marrakech Judo Grand Prix kicked off yesterday with the participation of ten Israeli athletes. The opening day registered noriots against Israeli symbols as was the case during last year’s session in the UAE.  The event whose first day fell on Women’s Day will last until Sunday, March 10. The International Judo Federation (IJF) acknowledged Morocco’s “vast amount of experience in hosting elite level judo events,” giving the example of its hosting of a World Openweight Championships and a World Judo Masters in Rabat, in addition to a Grand Prix last year in Agadir. In Marrakech, the event has so far not faced any issues with the participation of Israeli athletes. However, Morocco has reportedly asked Israeli participants to not wave their flags to avoid any issues. The IJF imposes sanctions on hosting countries that do not abide by the sports regulations, including equal treatment. The body has a history of punishing discrimination against participants. Last year, the IJF stripped the United Arab Emirates and Tunisia of rights to host two international tournaments after they failed to guarantee equal treatment for Israeli athletes. Though the IJF did not explicitly mention Israel, it requested the two countries in July to “provide a letter of guarantee signed by the government that all IJF member nations would have the right to participate in their events on equal conditions.” As both countries support the Palestinian cause, they refused to display the Israeli symbols and did not comply with the condition.  At the time, the federation suspended the competitions, Abu Dhabi Grand Slam and the Tunis Grand Prix, because the countries had passed the deadline for sending the letter. Over the next days in Marrakech, the tournament will see in action Olympic champion Beslan Mudranov (Russia), Olympic bronze medallist Automne Pavia (France), double Olympic bronze medallist Leandro Guilheiro (Brazil), Olympic bronze medallist Antoine Valois-Fortier (Canada) and Olympic bronze medallist Laura Vargas Koch (Germany).

Amsterdam – Yesterday was International Women’s Day, a day to celebrate womanhood and women’s achievements throughout history. But although the day has been celebrated in different forms for well over a century, the worldwide suffering of women persists. How can we celebrate Women’s Day when many women across the world have limited access to healthcare and education? Many unmarried women who seek reproductive healthcare for family planning or treatment for possible sexually transmitted infections are being stigmatized or sent away. In Morocco, unmarried women trying to access sexual health services are often refused help. How can we celebrate Women’s Day when so many women worldwide are living in period poverty or being stigmatized for having a period? As well as period poverty, the stigmatization of women’s menstrual cycles means that girls living in the Sahel, Tibet, and parts of India, as well as many other parts of the world are being turned away from school, their homes or even being abandoned altogether simply for menstruating. In parts of the world, menstruating women are perceived as dirty. As long as women are being told by men that they are half of the “deen” (religion) because they cannot pray or fast for 12 weeks a year, they are being degraded based on biology. Despite the uterus bringing every human being into the world, in many cultures men believe that women should still be obedient to their fathers, brothers, or if they get married, husbands. Such entrenched beliefs lead many women to suffer in silence, believing that it is their duty to be “patient” or have “sabr” for their situation, as well as allowing such atrocities as the legalization of marital rape in Morocco to persist to this day. How can we celebrate Women’s Day as long as some women continue to be forced into sex work? Sex workers are criminalized in many countries and face harsh punishments. Only the Netherlands and in Senegal have decriminalized sex work, and there are multiple organizations in these countries to support women and provide alternative means to financial stability. But unfortunately, these are unique approaches. Meanwhile, illegal sex work in countries such as Morocco is becoming increasingly widespread, having wide repercussions for Moroccan women. There can be no happy International Women’s Day as long as countries like France continue to violate Muslim women’s rights and police their right to freedom of expression by restricting the wearing of hijabs and niqabs. Countries that advocate for freedom, equality, and democracy, but judge Muslim women for expressing their faith as they choose are just as oppressive as countries and communities that judge women who do not cover “enough.” No government, institution, community, or individual should ever tell a woman how to dress or how not to dress, especially if it is in order to prevent sexual provocation. In Saudi Arabia, women face some of the hardest challenges in the world in terms of rights. Under male guardianship laws, women are still not able to make major decisions without male permission. They cannot travel alone without permission and can be divorced through a mobile application. The news that Saudi women were finally granted the right to drive should not be newsworthy; it should be the norm. It should be a shame that any human being is limited in their freedom of movement based on gender. As long as women are subject to patriarchal systems and laws, no woman is truly free. Even in Amsterdam, the city I call home, I am either over-sexualized or deemed less intelligent and unambitious as a Moroccan Muslim woman. The intersections between discrimination based on gender, race, faith, and sexuality mean that even in parts of the world which are believed to have achieved relative “gender equality,” women are facing discrimination in shifting, compounded ways as compared to their counterparts a century ago. In the wake of International Women’s Day, I call on us all to raise the bar of our expectations for equality and refuse to settle for less than true justice.

Rabat – The Moroccan subsidiary of Centrale Danone posted a net loss of MAD 538 million in 2018. The company’s gross revenue amounted to MAD 4.76 billion, down 27 percent compared to 2017.  Last year’s boycott on the Moroccan subsidiary of the French dairy company had a drastic impact on all activities.

Danone’s gross operating income declined by 75 percent to MAD 179 million. “The cost-saving plan launched after the boycott did not cover all of our fixed costs,” the group said in a statement.

The MAD 538 million loss is in line with the profit warning that the company announced in November. As a result of the nine-figure loss, the company’s assets decreased by MAD 653 million compared to 2017.

The company’s board said it would meet on June 14 and propose that no dividends be paid to shareholders.
 The managers of the company said that due to the unprecedented crisis, Centrale Danone will keep doing “everything in its power to meet the needs of its consumers by remaining an accessible and even more innovative brand.”  “The consequences of this crisis will severely affect the company’s financial results for the first half of 2019,” they added. In April 2018, Moroccans launched a boycott targeting Danone, Oulmes Mineral Water and Afriquia Gas, saying the three companies had raised prices because of their large share of their respective markets. Oulmes Mineral Water, known for its subsidiary Sidi Ali, netted only MAD 9.74 million in the first half of 2018, down 87 percent from net earnings in the first half of 2017.  Ever since the Danone boycott, many Moroccans have called for similar actions. The wave of boycott calls targeted products like chicken, a public transportation company, and public figures such as pop star Saad Lamjarred.

Rabat – Moroccan banks are still suffering from high credit and asset risk, with even major banks having financial weaknesses, according to the latest Fitch report on Morocco’s credit rating based on data from the first half of 2018, released March 8. The Fitch credit rating for Morocco has not changed much since 2007, according to the latest Fitch report. Nonetheless, the report noted that high credit risk and relatively low reserves impact the success of Moroccan banks. Meanwhile, the probability of creditors being able to collect debts in Morocco is significantly lower than in developed countries. Moroccan banks are still suffering from low asset quality and insufficient capital, according to the new Fitch Ratings report. Over the past five years, Morocco’s seven largest banks have reported an average ratio of impaired loans to total, gross loans of just under 10 percent. The ratio was 9.8 percent at the end of the first half of 2018.  Compared to developed markets, this rate of impaired loans, or loans that creditors may not be able to collect, is high. Fitch further estimates that with better reporting, “true impairment ratios … are likely to be higher at 15%-18%.” As well as having high credit risk and low reserves, Moroccan banks lend a significant portion of their loans to just a few entities, giving them a heavy “single obligor concentration risk.” The concentration of loans with just a few entities makes banks’ credit rating even lower. At the end of the first half of 2018, “the top 20 loans represented on average 20 percent of the total loans” of the banks rated by Fitch. For banks that specialize in lending to big companies, the concentrations could be much higher. On a positive note, banks increased their reserves in comparison to their risky loans. The average reserve coverage for impaired loans in the seven largest banks was 83 percent at the end of the first half of 2018, compared with 73 percent at the end of the same period in 2017. Fitch measured the capital ratio and found that banks have low reserves.  Fitch says that the average tier 1 core capital ratio, the ratio of reserves and equity to risk-weighted assets, of the seven largest Moroccan banks was only 10 percent at the first half of 2018.  The largest seven banks represent about 85 percent of the banking sector’s assets.  Major banks lack financial strength The Fitch core capital ratios are in the low range for some major national banks, including Attijariwafa Bank and BMCE Bank. Moroccan banks are sound in terms of profitability, financing, and liquidity. However, as shown in their high concentration of loans, their assets are of low quality and their equity capital is insufficient, according to the report. The major banks posted an average annualized operating return of 2 percent on risk-weighted assets in the first half of 2018, driven by an average margin of 3.6 percent and a cost to income ratio of 53 percent. Stable deposits are the main source of funding for banks. Morocco’s sovereign rating has been stable at BBB- since Fitch first assigned it in 2007. Underpinning this rating are macroeconomic stability, comfortable external buffer margins, and a small share of foreign-currency debt in the public sector.  However, these factors are counteracted by weak development, high public debt, and higher current account deficits than those in the BBB category. In the report, Fitch projects Morocco’s annual GDP growth to average 3.2 percent in 2018-2020.

Rabat – The Gabonese presidency has denied that President Ali Bongo has recruited a “clone” or a look-alike to replace him in Gabon while he has been in Morocco for months. A new hoax has it that Ali Bongo sent his “clone” to Gabon while he remained either in Saudi Arabia or Morocco to receive medical treatment after he suffered a stroke in October 2018.  The Gabonese presidential spokesperson, Ike Ngouoni, dismissed the rumors but appreciated  “the level of creativity” in the story. Nguoni told reporters, according to Africanews: “The President of the Republic was here in flesh, a number of people saw him. He went around the city.” “Some of [the people] were able to approach him, observe him, see him. It is totally a hoax. I admire the level of creativity, especially on the internet and their persistence in these rumours,” he stated. Bongo, who is currently receiving treatment in Morocco, has returned to his country twice since the New Year for very brief visits after a failed coup. Rebels emerged in Libreville in January to denounce Bongo’s absence. Bongo suffered a stroke in October during a visit to Saudi Arabia and spent nearly a month at King Faisal Hospital in Riyadh. Rumors about his death had even emerged. In November, the president arrived in Rabat, Morocco, to pursue treatment at the invitation of King Mohammed VI, who also shares a good friendship with Bongo. Bongo is not the first African president to be in the center of a cloning hoax. In December 2018, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari denied claims that he died and was replaced by a clone after he spent more than three months recovering from an unspecified illness in London in 2017. The question popped up during his meeting with Nigerians in Poland, asking if he was the real Buhari and whether he was cloned. “The ignorant rumors are not surprising,” he responded.

Rabat – Algerian authorities suspended train services yesterday while huge numbers of protesters demonstrated in Algiers and other cities and towns across the country to pressure President Abdelaziz Bouteflika into stepping out of the 2019 election. Carrying Algerian flags, women and men from different backgrounds and ages chanted slogans “Peaceful, peaceful!” and held banners reading, “We’re making Algeria great again.” The day also marked the arrest of 195 protesters who were looting, according to the state television.  On Thursday, Bouteflika had warned of individuals who try to cause chaos but also praised the majority of demonstrators for their discipline. Most of the people involved in the protests are young Algerians. However, as of this week, a number of influential people, including elders of the Association of Veterans of the War of Independence against the French between 1954 and 1962, lawyers, labor unions, and journalists have added momentum. The wave of protests started on Friday, February 22, after the ailing Bouteflika, 82, announced that he would seek a fifth term as president in the election in April. The demonstration is the biggest in the North African country since the 2011 Arab Spring. On Tuesday, thousands of students from several campuses across Algiers marched, responding to Bouteflika’s offer to leave within one year if he wins re-election, saying that they “cannot wait a second” for him to leave.

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi refused to express the government’s opinion on the protests in Algeria. In a press conference that followed the weekly meeting of the government council on Thursday, El Khalfi received several questions about Morocco’s position on what is happening in Algeria.  At first, El Khalfi said he would answer them at the end of the conference. Then, he responded: “Regarding questions about Algeria’s protests, I will answer you with this sentence: I will not answer this question.” In contrast, France has commented on its former colony’s protest and said that it is up to Algerians to decide their future. “We must let the electoral process unfold,” said foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday. Le Drian commented to lawmakers, “France, obviously, because of our historical links, is very attentive to the unfolding events.” The shared and historical links with Algeria continues to give France clout through close diplomatic, economic, and security ties, as well as the large Algerian diaspora in France. For two weeks now, thousands of Algerians have been protesting the announcement that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is running for a fifth term in office, calling him not to stand in the election scheduled for April 18.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) celebrated Moroccan police officers and their “major role in serving the national security and safety of citizens.” Morocco’s DGSN, headed by Abdellatif Hammouchi, organized celebrations and handed out gifts to honor police women today for their dedication to fighting crime and protecting citizens. DGSN also posted a video online of students at the Royal Institute of Police and policewomen who spoke briefly, in Arabic, French, Tamazight (Berber), and English, about why they chose their field.  The 45-second video featured medical examiners, officers, and professors with DGSN. “With a passion for law enforcement I’m able to do what I love everyday,” said Majda Lakhder. “As a doctor with Ph.D. in biology, I chose to become a professor in the field of forensic science,” said Houki Kaoutar. “I chose this job because I love it and love horse riding!” said Samia El Khayati, a mounted police officer.

On March 8, the world celebrated the achievements of women’s gains through hard work. With the participation of women officers, DGSN brought 1,636,824 people to justice in three years—from May 15, 2015 to May 14, 2018, according to Hammouchi’s statement at DGSN’s 62nd anniversary last year. The three year period witnessed the dismantling of 1,388 criminal networks and the arrest of 2,486 suspects of robberies, prevention of 15,883 irregular immigration attempts, and the arrest of 783 human smugglers operating in 109 criminal networks active in undocumented immigration by boat, car or false identity documents.

Rabat – Divided by a sidewalk, two separate protests marched in unison to the parliament building on International Women’s Day (IWD). In honor of the globally recognized day, a sit-in for women’s rights was hosted by the National Coordinating Body for the Joint Commemoration of International Women’s Day. Across the street, the final installment of the six-day contractual teachers’ protest was taking place with the theme of women in mind. The Moroccan Association of Human Rights (MAHR) was one of the twelve organizations involved in coordinating the commemoration of IWD. Naija Labrim, a volunteer for the organization, helped plan the sit-in. “We want women all over Morocco to realize that what we have now is not enough,” Labrim told Morocco World News. “This sit-in, and all the ones before it, are meant to remind people with power and without power that more needs to be done.” For the last 20 years, Labrim has been attending similar events with the MAHR, which she joined in 1979. “This movement won’t stop until our demands are met. Things have improved a little over the years but we are far from achieving what we want,” Labrim said. “We will do this again next year, and the year after, and every year after that.” Labrim continues to hope the decades of protesting have led to change in Moroccan society. “It takes a lot of time to measure the success of these sit-ins and peaceful protests. I will always hope we made a difference,” Labrim added. “But at least I know each year we have reminded those in power they have more to do for women’s rights.” Instead of hosting a march, which would require authorization from the Ministry of Interior, the collection of organizations decided on the sit-in. With a banner in hand, Labrim, along with her associates, were able to bring together more than 50 protestors — at least a dozen more than the year before. But the chants of “What you give to the men, give to the women,” were not theirs, they were coming from teachers. At the end of their six-day sit-in that began on Monday, the contractual teachers’ protests came to a stop on the road across from Labrim and the other International Women’s Day demonstrators. Though the teachers were primarily protesting the government’s refusal to admit them as regular employees, the Friday afternoon march also focused on female educators. At the forefront of the march, along with many of her colleagues was Imane Ragi, a French teacher from the Sidi Slimane School in Laabyate. “We always want teachers to be respected, but today, we especially want female teachers to be honored in both the classrooms and the streets,” Ragi told Morocco World News. “I hope the government takes today into consideration and stops insulting and beating teachers around the country.” This was in direct reference to the violence that occurred during the February 18-20 protests, which left many injured and sparked the week-long rally. No injuries were reported during either of the IWD protests. Ragi and many of her colleagues, who were present during the February protests, were brought together by the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers and the National Federation of Teachers. Both unions have organized strategic marches in major cities across  Morocco, including Kenitra, Casablanca, Tétouan, Qujda, Errachidia and Marrakech. “Until we have our rights we will continue to protest,” Ragi said. “Our dream is to be integrated into the government’s public employment, so that we can go back to our students.” By having the march end in front of parliament, Ragi hopes their message will resonate with those in power. She is especially hopeful, that on International Women’s Day, the females working within parliament will be listening. Following the 2016 election, 81 women were elected to serve in the House of Representatives, making up 21 percent of the parliament. Chanting along, side-by-side with Ragi were many of her male colleagues. “Women teachers play the most important role in the education system and they are also the majority of the education system,” said Abdelhaq Zouitina, a national science teacher from Lycée Prince Moulay Rchid School in Tiddass. “We always want to show them our support, especially on International Women’s Day.” According to the official International Women’s Day website, the history behind the global movement began in a conference room in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was there, during the 1910 International Conference of Working Women, that the idea of having one day a year to celebrate women and reinforce their demands was proposed. This was ultimately accepted and in 1913, March 8 became the globally recognized date. More than 60 years later in 1975, the United Nations (UN) announced that International Women’s Day be an official day of observance for its member countries — Morocco joined the UN in 1956. With IWD events occurring all over the world, Ragi hopes the one in Morocco sets an example for the country’s future generation. “I hope my example is teaching my students to defend their rights to their last breath and to never stop hoping that they will achieve their dreams.”

Rabat – The research and training arm of the Islamic Finance Advisory and Assurance Services (IFAAS) consultancy firm and the Kramer Levin law firm have collaborated to present the inaugural Africa Sukuk Conference on Sharia-compliant bonds. The event is scheduled for March 19-20 at Sofitel Hotel in Casablanca.  The conference will gather potential sukuk issuers, investors, and regulators and aims to facilitate African and international players actively seeking opportunities. According to Boubkeur Ajdir, a partner at IFAAS, sukuks are funding tools that conform to Islamic finance principles, also called Sharia-compliant bonds. Any entity in search of funding, whether established companies or governments, can use sukuks to raise money in the financial market. Ajdir told Morocco World News that sukuks use the Islamic financing contracts such as sales contracts, partnerships, or leasing. In contrast, in traditional banking, funds are lent with interest. He added, “Sukuks are financial instruments that will enable companies to go through capital markets without going through the banking loan.” Ajdir related that “participatory” Islamic banking can play a role in sukuks by suggesting certificates of sukuks to their clients as investors.  In a press release, IFAAS Group said that “the event will offer policymakers, professionals and corporate decision-makers from different regions, the opportunity to share experiences from across the growing global market.” According to Farrukh Raza, CEO of IFAAS Group, “Interest in Sukuk is growing in Africa, amongst both national and private entities. Many countries have made tremendous progress with the integration of Islamic finance into their national regulatory frameworks.” IFAAS Group also mentioned a recent report by the Islamic finance standards-setting body, International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM). The report pointed out that sukuk issuances in Africa reached nearly $22 billion in 2018 and that South Africa and West African states have issued several sovereign sukuk.  The report said that in October 2018, Morocco joined them with its debut issuance of MAD 1 billion in sukuk. Strategic partners for Africa Sukuk Conference include the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector; the private sector arm of Islamic Development Bank Group; and Al Akhdar Bank, the Moroccan participatory bank.

By Mohamed Amine Benabou Rabat – Amid growing public outrage over the ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s run for a fifth term, Algerian dissidents have devised a new form of protest, launching on Facebook a “phone call campaign.”  Algerians bombarded Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland, where they believe Bouteflika is receiving medical care, with a surge of phone calls enquiring about Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s state of health. The campaign is the latest in a series of protests, which has also seen Algerians create memes ridiculing the ailing president’s re-election bid. The spokesperson of the hospital, Nicolas de Saussure, said only a few phone calls were “unfriendly.”

According to Swiss broadcaster RTS, the number of calls has been estimated at 3,000 per day on average. On Tuesday, March 5, the hospital received more than 1,500 calls, stated de Saussure.

A video that was secretly filmed confirmed the presence of Bouteflika at the hospital in Geneva. Bouteflika has only been in Switzerland since late February but has continually been seeking treatment in Switzerland since 1980. Algerians also swamped the hospital’s Facebook page with comments and private messages, forcing moderators to deactivate the page. The hospital switchboard could hardly handle the number of calls. They also had to increase a number of evening standby staff because it had an impact on the overall performance of the hospital.

Rabat – Pretoria has finally acknowledged the diplomatic credentials of Morocco’s new ambassador to South Africa, according to a Moroccan diplomatic source quoted earlier this week in a number of Moroccan publications. Are Rabat and Pretoria finally ready to bury the hatchet and nourish the peaceful diplomatic ties that the AU is increasingly requesting of continental giants? The answer is complicated, but at least the two countries appear to be considering rapprochement. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation received this week a letter from South Africa,” the Moroccan source was quoted as saying. The letter, the source explained, came with the good news—as far as African affairs are concerned—that South Africa would finally accept the hand that Morocco had extended in August 2018. Pretoria has “finally accepted former deputy foreign Minister Youssef Amrani as Morocco’s ambassador to Pretoria,” the source added. More than an appointment When King Mohammed VI appointed 14 new ambassadors in August 2018, the one appointment that generated comments in diplomatic circles was the appointment of Amrani to represent Morocco in South Africa. Of paramount importance in such debates was the profile of the newly-appointed Moroccan ambassador to Pretoria. While traditional ambassadorial appointments often have to do with changing from one ambassadorship to another or promoting promising young civil servants at the foreign affairs ministry, Amrani was already an established—and revered—senior in Moroccan diplomacy. As Moroccan ambassador to a number of South American countries between 1996-2003, Amrani played a considerable part in Morocco’s ongoing diplomatic breakthrough in Latin America, a region mostly known for its endorsement of “revolutionary” and Marxist-communist movements like the Polisario Front. After his Latin American years, Amrani joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rabat, where he occupied a number of “strategic posts,” including chief of the bilateral relations office, secretary general of the ministry, and delegate minister. Prior to his appointment as ambassador to Pretoria, he most recently served as the chief of mission at the Royal Cabinet. In that position, Amrani was part of the restricted circle of senior dignitaries advising the King on matters of utmost diplomatic significance. In appointing Amrani to the Pretoria office, the King was sending another part of the message he addressed to his AU counterparts on the day Morocco officially returned to the organization in January 2017. Now that the North African kingdom is “back home,” it plans to make its mark on continental politics, including being present in previously uncharted waters for the advancement of its “legitimate interests.” More than an appointee, Amrani will be a missionary in South Africa, the heart of his task being to progressively engineer a diplomatic common ground with South Africa, a strong Polisario supporter. For Amrani’s mission to be possible, or start, however, it needed Pretoria’s stamp. The alleged letter the Moroccan diplomatic source referred to was that stamp. Even though the stamp came very late—more than seven months after Amrani’s appointment—and very half-heartedly, it may be enough to suggest that some things are changing. But South Africa suggested it had reasons for delaying Amrani’s confirmation. The divergence between the two countries hit its lowest mark in 2004 when Morocco’s ambassador to Pretoria hurriedly left his post. Morocco was protesting against South Africa’s recognition of the Polisario-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. After overtly opposing each other’s interests for over a decade, Rabat and Pretoria finally gave signs of normalization in November 2017, when King Mohammed VI met with then-President Jacob Zuma at an AU summit in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire. That was less than a year after Morocco joined the AU, and the suggestion was clear: Establishing firm relations with other African nations has become the center of gravity of Morocco’s new “royal diplomacy.” As news articles suggesting a “new African momentum” in Rabat-Pretoria ties began spreading, explaining the benefits of normalized ties between the two countries, Pretoria announced that it was poised to consider opening a new page with Morocco. Mxolisi Sizo Nkosi, a senior official in the South African foreign ministry, said in the aftermath of the Abidjan meeting that “the ball is Morocco’s court if the Kingdom wants to return an ambassador to Pretoria.” According to the South African official, “the starting point for any normalization of relations between Rabat and Pretoria would have to be Morocco replying to the 14-year-old South African request.” Appointing Amrani was Morocco’s reply, putting the ball in South Africa’s court. And now that Pretoria has allegedly positively replied by accepting Amrani’s appointment, can the much-reported “new momentum” be said to have finally begun?
The answer will depend on how President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced President Zuma in early 2018, will reply to King Mohammed VI’s perceived insistence on intra-African cooperation. The search for common ground is recognized as the primary goal of any successful diplomatic endeavor. Continuously befriending already friendly countries is singing to the choir. It is easy and demands little or no effort. Good, outstanding diplomacy, on the other hand, requires efforts, dedication to brokering an agreement between parties seemingly destined to disagreement and hostility. Much has happened since President Ramaphosa came to power. Although President Ramaphosa has not engineered any substantive deviation from the official South African position on Western Sahara, he has given it a much fiercer pro-Polisario resonance. He has called on Morocco to “decolonize” Western Sahara and has vowed to throw South Africa’s international weight behind Polisario’s “Sahrawi cause.” As Pretoria and Rabat will begin to slowly “discuss diplomacy” in the coming weeks and months, the usual diplomatic question will be raised, “What is in it for us?” South Africa and Morocco know the answer to that question: There is a lot to benefit for both countries should they decide to cooperate. “The cultural heritage between Morocco and South Africa should enable the two parties to move forwards,” Germany’s Deutsche Welle wrote in late 2017. The newspaper highlighted that rapprochement between Rabat and Pretoria will benefit an Africa thirsty for relevance and significance in global affairs, in addition to benefiting the two countries. The same argument was made nearly a year later, this time by South African experts on African security. Reacting to South Africa’s election as a non-permanent member at the UN Security Council, they stressed that the country should be more neutral and flexible in African crises like Western Sahara. A vision of “continental leadership,” “strategic clarity,” and “intra-African coherence and consistency,” they argued, should be the guiding principles of South Africa’s diplomacy, instead of “the current trap of worsening distrust.” By agreeing to break nearly 15 years of diplomatic stalemate, South Africa and Morocco may have suggested that they are finally ready to discuss, and incrementally go beyond, their “strategic disagreements.” But while the prospect of discussion between two countries that have avoided each other and fought each other on the diplomatic and financial terrains should be applauded, no one should get ahead of themselves. Premature celebration often ends in disappointment. Amrani’s appointment is not in itself the end of an anachronistic age in Morocco-South Africa relations, but it may herald the beginning of a whole new era.

Rabat – The UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, will convene the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict for a second roundtable on March 21-22. The second roundtable will take place in Geneva at the Palace of Nations, a source told Moroccan news outlet Le360. High representatives from Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario are expected to take part in the meeting. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, along with a delegation of Sahrawis, represented Morocco during the first roundtable, which took place on December 5-6 in Geneva. The second roundtable is at the request of Kohler, who said that a solution to the Western Sahara conflict is possible. Rabat rejects any solution other than autonomy under its sovereignty, emphasizing the need to preserve territorial integrity and stability in the region. In January, Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale reiterated Morocco’s principles, saying that the autonomy plan is the only solution that Morocco can offer for the conflict. The United Nations has not yet revealed the date of the second roundtable. On March 6, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, said that it would take place in the second half of March. Before the first roundtable, a round of direct negotiations launched by the UN in March 2007 stalled due to disagreements between Morocco and Polisario. Following the roundtable, the UN Security Council will convene on April 9 and 10 to consult on Western Sahara and the UN peacekeeping mission in the region, MINURSO, whose six month mandate will end on April 30.

Rabat – A European official has stressed the importance of Morocco in Europe’s plan to reinforce the Euro-African framework of collaboration. On a “friendship trip” to Morocco, Belgium’s former Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said on Thursday that his country has always been keen on strengthening ties with Morocco, and remains an important partner for the North African country. According to Di Rupo, Morocco’s strategic location gives it prime importance in Europe’s rising interest in Africa. Rabat, the Belgian argued, should be the natural focal point in any current and prospective Euro-African agenda. Both for Belgium as an individual European state and for the European Union as whole Morocco constitutes a bridge to Africa, he pointed out. Di Rupo said Brussels is planning to invest more in African affairs, suggesting that Morocco would be the point of departure of that Euro-African impetus to cooperate on security, trade, and other sectors. The goal of such increased Euro-African cooperation would be to invest in security, stability, and human development. The former Belgian PM also hailed Morocco’s security efforts. He especially pointed out the kingdom’s “successful and effective” anti-terrorism system, saying that Rabat could inspire other African countries to duplicate its anti-terrorism architecture. Di Rupo’s comments come as Europe shows interest in Africa in the hope of finding a sustainable solution to the migration crisis. Faced with a wave of migrants from Africa, European officials have recently called for the need to devise new paradigms in the relationship with Africa. While attending the MEDays forum in Tangier in November 2018, Belgium’s budget and civil service minister Andre Flahaut told Morocco World News that “Europe’s last hope is to listen to the south.” He noted that Europe’s neglectful and patronizing attitude to Africa contributed to deepening the crises now facing both continents. Flahaut said, “When I say engage with Africa, I mean genuine and sincere cooperation. I don’t mean Europe’s traditional inclination towards neocolonialism and paternalism when dealing with countries in the South…. Being partners with someone means being respectful of each other’s potential and listening to each other to move forward together.” According to its proponents, the objective of the new Euro-Africa cooperation is to favor concerted efforts to face the future together.

Rabat – Throughout a 15-page report, the EU Commission informed the European Parliament and the European Council of EU partnerships with Morocco to control migration because of Morocco’s importance as a transit country for migrants. The report emphasized the collaboration between Morocco and the EU and their will to “form a closer, deeper and more ambitious partnership.” According to the report, mobility and migration are key elements of the partnership “through a mixture of financial support, closer expert contacts and operational cooperation, including with the support of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.” Yesterday, EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos commended the EU-Morocco partnership, emphasizing his determination to enhance the relationship. The EU official also said that the migration crisis are over, comparing last year’s statistics with the previous year. Avramopoulos said, “Misinformation, untruths, and fake news” make it “hard to know what is actually going on.” In the report, the European Commission recalled that Morocco benefits from financial support as the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa is working to “develop cooperation along the whole of the route to the Western Mediterranean.” The EU body is working on a cross-border collaboration program worth €8.6 million to reinforce migration governance between four African states: Morocco, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal. The program aims to intensify regional policy dialogue on migration. The report emphasized that new assistance from EU and Spain “should be directed at reducing irregular arrivals from the Moroccan coast and lead to further engagement with Morocco and other relevant countries to increase the effective readmission of irregular migrants.” In recent months, Morocco and Spain collaborated together on migration control at their border. The collaboration was promoted during a royal Spanish visit in Morocco in February, when King Felipe VI and his wife Queen Letizia visited Morocco. Spain also pressured the EU to support Morocco financially. The report also spoke about an investment in dialogue with partner countries, emphasizing that talks with partner countries “brought tangible steps forward.” According to the report, the commission will resume negotiations with Tunisia and Morocco. The commission is also working on a pilot project, including a program to manage “legal migration more effectively with key partner countries.” The project involves Belgium, Morocco, Nigeria, and Lithuania. It “addresses skill shortages in the IT sector with potential reintegration at the end of the project.” In February, an EU delegation visited Morocco to discuss cooperation on vocational training. According to the state secretariat of vocational training, Morocco received €60 million. The program aims to develop a broader and integrated vocational training system. It also focuses on the adaptation of the training to employers’ needs, the improvement of the quality of the vocational training system, and strengthening coordination between stakeholders.

Rabat – Morocco approved two draft laws related to two agreements signed on February 13 between Spain and Morocco signed during the Spanish King’s visit in the country. The weekly government council on Thursday in Rabat approved Draft Law 15.19 related to the agreement on cooperation against crime in all its forms, signed by Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit and his Spanish counterpart Fernando Grande-Marlaska Gomez. The agreement also establishes cooperation on eliminating terrorism and tracking down terrorist financing, fighting drug trafficking, human trafficking, arbitrary arrest and detention, property crimes, money laundering, illicit trade of firearms, explosives, and nuclear materials. The second, Draft Law 16.19 is related to the agreement on Spain’s irrevocable offer of Tangier’s Teatro Cervantes (Grand Theater Cervantes) to Morocco. The agreement was also signed by the two ministers, Laftit and Gomez. The other agreements that the government council has not yet approved are related to collaboration on energy, culture, trade, and aeronautics, among others. The official visit of King Felipe VI of Spain to Morocco on February 13 paved the way for stronger cooperations between the two neighboring countries. The visit reflected the “depth and quality of bilateral ties thanks to the shared will to foster the multidimensional strategic partnership uniting the two neighboring and friendly countries,” stated the Moroccan Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Nurses are planning to stage three nationwide strikes starting next week. They decided to go on a weekly strike for the next three weeks, March 13, 21, and 28. In a meeting organized by the Movement of Nurses and Health Technicians in Morocco (MITSAM) on Saturday, March 2, nurses outlined the details of their strike, which they say is in response to the Ministry of Health’s reluctance to take their demands seriously.  The nurses are calling for “equality in compensation for occupational hazards, revision of the unjust conditions for promotion, justice for victims, setting up a job and competency framework, and the integration of unemployed nurses into the public sector.”  Afaf Elam, a member of MITSAM’s national committee of media and communication, said in a statement, “If our demands are disregarded, we will stage a 24-hour nationwide strike on April 16-17 along with a march in the capital.”  She clarified that the strike will involve all hospital staff except for emergency departments and intensive care units.  Despite previous strikes carried out throughout 2018 up to today, Elam stated, nurses find themselves compelled to engage in more strikes, which are detrimental to patients, because the government “has been inattentive to our demands.” In December 2018, police arrested a nurse for alleged infant negligence and subsequent death. The nurse served one month in prison and was released on bail early this year. MITSAM ascribed the negligence to the absence of specialists, saying the hospital did not have a pediatrician or pharmacist, amid a severe shortage of human resources. In a 2010 report, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it found in 2006 that Morocco was “among the countries that remain extremely vulnerable to the exodus of health care professionals to other countries.” According to the WHO, in 2007, “the number of medical, nursing, and paramedical staff providing direct care to patients was well below the critical threshold of 2.3 health care providers for every 1,000 inhabitants,” which is “necessary to assure essential care,” especially in relation to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000.

Rabat – In a note dedicated to International Women’s Day, Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) discussed a number of issues facing Moroccan women in urban and rural areas, including child marriage. HCP estimated that 48,291 minors got married before the age of 18 in 2014, a slight decrease of 13 percent from 2004.  HCP acknowledged that girls remain the majority of the victims of child marriage, representing 94.8 percent (45,786 girls) of married minors. In 2004, HCP said that 55,379 girls were married before the legal age. The note added that almost one-third of married minors (31.1 percent) already have at least one child, and the vast majority of non-single girls are housewives (87.7 percent). A previous study from HCP explained that child marriages actually increased in Morocco between 2007 and 2015. Child marriages can be legalized if the family gets a waiver for the minor. The number of waiver requests for minors, which are usually granted, increased to 41,669 in 2015, compared to 38,331 in 2007. The study suggested that the increase in marriages of minors was caused by traditions and a crisis of deteriorated values. While Morocco has not published recent statistics about child marriages, some associations have estimated the large number of minors who enter wedlock in Morocco, especially in rural areas, each year. The “Droit &amp; Justice,” an organization specializing in promoting rule of law in Morocco, found that 30,000 child brides get married each year in Morocco. Education is no better From child marriage to illiteracy, Moroccan women continue to face major obstacles in education. Despite progress, women are still disadvantaged, especially in rural areas, according to HCP. The March 8 note emphasized that one in 10 girls aged 7-12 dropped out of school in rural areas and 15 percent of girls aged 15-24 are illiterate. The statistics from 2014 show that six out of 10 rural women remain illiterate compared to 35 percent of rural men and 30 percent of urban women. In 2018, Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH) again found that illiteracy is higher in rural areas, noting that 8 percent more boys went to high school than girls during the 2012-2017 period. The wide gap between the gender increases with age as the gap between boys and girls was 0.5 percent for ages 6-11, 4.5 percent for ages 12-14, and 8.1 percent for ages 15-17 in 2017. Women’s employment rate is low Despite the government’s promises to integrate Moroccan women into the labor market, statistics show few Moroccan women are employed. HCP presented data from the 2018 National Employment Survey that reveals women’s labor participation rate is only 22.2 percent. The rate for men is nearly three times higher. The note emphasized that the unemployment rate of women is continuously increasing and remains much higher than that of men. “In 2017, almost 40.5 percent of employed women are family helpers who receive no remuneration.” HCP added that only 8.9 percent of employers and 14.1 percent of the self-employed are women. The alarming findings reveal that more than a quarter of young people between the ages of 15 and 24, or 1.7 million young Moroccans, do not work, are not in school, and are not pursuing any training, of which 80 percent are women. In mid-2018, Morocco had an estimated 17.67 million women, just more than a half of its population (50.1 percent). Fertility rate drops in Morocco The note, however, shared concerns over the fertility rate, which dropped from 4.46 children per woman in 1987 to 2.2 children in 2014. HCP said that the urban fertility rate is as low as that of France, 2 children per woman, thus falling below the population replacement rate. In rural areas, the fertility rate dropped from 5.95 children per woman in 1987 to 2.5 in 2014. Young women suffer more violence The Moroccan government adopted a law last year to combat violence against women and to curb gender discrimination. Moroccan and international activists criticized the law, arguing that it has several loopholes. Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination criminalizes sexual harassment and assaults in public spaces as well as cybercrime. Although HCP did not provide updated statistics, the number women subject to violence is alarming. HCP revealed that 63 percent of women had experienced violence in 2009. “Young women aged 18 to 24 are the most affected by all types of violence: 70.3 percent at the national level (79.3 percent in urban areas and 60.4 percent in rural areas).” Defending the law, Minister of Solidarity and Family Bassima Hakkaoui said that the law against violence on women ensures the “protection of women at a very high level, it will frame people, raise awareness about the issue of violence, and the issue of discrimination of Moroccan women.”

Rabat – A Moroccan feminist association, the Union of Women’s Action (UAF), released a statement on Women’s Day drawing attention to Moroccan women’s struggle with sexism, gender-based violence, marginalization,  feminization of poverty, and lack of enforcement of their legal rights. UAF sounded the alarm on the “worrying” situation of women in Morocco which ranked among those with a large gender gap—137th of 149 world countries. Meanwhile, the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2019 report published on February 27 ranked Morocco third of Middle Eastern and North African countries in terms of gender equality in law and business. Despite women’s resolute movements and the fact that the Moroccan Constitution in Article 19 stipulates that men and women should “enjoy, in equality, the rights and freedoms of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental character,” there has been no “significant development in the promotion and protection of women’s rights,” said UAF. On behalf of women, UAF expressed disappointment with the country’s new Law 103-13, enacted in September 2018, on the elimination of sexual harassment and gender-based violence, criticizing the way it works practically. “The promulgation of Law 103-13 fighting violence against women has been a great disappointment due to its inability to protect against [violence], prevent it, and end impunity.” Because some offenders receive leniency, said UAF, the law will not allow the elimination of the violence “which affects two-thirds of Moroccan women.” In addition, UAF referred to Law 79-14 on equality and the combating of all forms of discrimination and the new Law 19-12 protecting domestic workers. The association asserted that the first does not respect international standards on gender equality, and the second does not fight the employment of child maids but instead “preserves their exploitation.” The housemaid law, also enacted in September, requires employers to have written contracts ensuring the workers’ rights by limiting their working hours to 40 hours per week for minors aged 16-18 and 48 hours for adults. UAF launched an ongoing national campaign in 2018, calling for a radical change in the Moroccan Family Code by ensuring equality between in marriage and in inheritance and ending polygamy and child marriage. So far, none of their calls have been answered. Equality of inheritance is an issue of hot debate in Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. While some are calling for equal inheritance between men and women, other more conservative Moroccans condemn the request, saying it defies Islam. According to the holy Qur’an’s Surat Nisa (4:11), women inherit half the share of men, “Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females.” As for child marriages, the number of girls who enter wedlock as minors surpasses that of boys. Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) showed in its January report based on the latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice that the overwhelming majority of child marriage waiver requests are made for teen girls instead of for teen boys.  Despite the country’s attempt to curb underage marriage, especially for girls, by raising the legal marriage age from 16 to 18 in Article 20 of the 2004 Mudawana (Family Code), Child marriages can be legalized if the family gets a waiver for the minor. The “Droit &amp; Justice,” an organization specializing in promoting rule of law in Morocco found that 30,000 child brides get married each year in Morocco. In addition, most school dropouts in Morocco are girls, especially in rural areas, noted UAF. The association argued that the number of women dying in childbirth, particularly rural women due to lack of proper healthcare, is still high despite a slight improvement. Lastly, UAF demands the protection of women’s rights and a reviewing of the Family Code and Penal Code. It also calls for the state to raise awareness against sexism in schools, the media, and through campaigns.

Rabat – This International Women’s Day, pause to take a look at five of Morocco’s many influential women who shaped history and showed great innovation in their fields.  Fatima al-Fihri, founder of the oldest continuously-operating university  It is worth going far back in history to look at the incredible life of Fatima al-Fihri. Al-Fihri was born in Karaouine, Tunisia, in A.D. 800, but her and family immigrated to Fez when she was just a child. Her father found success as a merchant in the city and al-Fihri married. The al-Fihra family had made a happy life for themselves in Morocco. However, her husband, father, and brother all died in a short period of time, leaving just al-Fihri and her sister behind.  The family left the two girls with a sizeable inheritance though, and al-Fihri, a devout Muslim, decided to give back to the community. Al-Fihri noticed that the mosques of Fez were not large enough to accommodate the city’s growing population, so she took it upon herself to build a grand mosque with a madrasa (school) attached. When construction began during Ramadan in A.D. 859, she vowed to fast until her dream was realized.  The madrasa was completed in A.D. 861 and named the University of Al Quaraouiyine after al-Fihri’s home city. She could not have imagined how long her legacy would last. To this day, students aged 13-30 attend the school to gain both high school-level diplomas and university degrees. Al-Fihri’s madrasa is the oldest university still operating. Most people would guess the answer to be Oxford or Cambridge in the UK, however, the University of Al Quaraouiyine was founded 200 years before either of the British universities. It unjustly comes as a surprise to many that the founder of the first university was not only Arab but a woman. Fatema Mernissi, influential Muslim feminist  Fatema Mernissi was a sociologist and author that left a deep mark in the world of Islamic feminism. She was born in Fez in 1940 and grew up in a harem with her mother and grandmother. She went on to write a memoir, published in 1994, about her childhood titled “Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood.” Mernissi’s father was relatively progressive by the standards of the time, allowing her to pursue an extensive education. She studied sociology at Mohammed V University in Rabat. She then briefly worked as a journalist in Paris before getting her Ph.D. from Brandeis University in Massachusetts in 1973. Later returning to Rabat, Mernissi became a sociology professor and researcher.  Mernissi focused on the status of women in Islam as well as gender inequality in Morocco. She wrote several highly acclaimed books on the subject, such as “Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamics in Modern Muslim Society” (1975), and her most famous work of all: “The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam” (1991). She passed away in Rabat in 2015. Mernissi’s influence as a Muslim feminist spread not only in Morocco but internationally, as she gave a voice to the women who may not otherwise have had one. Touria Chaoui, trail-blazing pilot  Touria Chaoui was born in Fez in 1936 and was the first female Moroccan pilot and the second female Arab pilot after Egyptian Lotfia Elnadi. She was born to a progressive and supportive father, who encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a pilot in the face of rigid gender stereotypes.  In 1950, when Chaoui was only 14, her father enrolled in her an aviation academy in Tit Mellil near Casablanca. The aviation academy was the only one in Morocco and mainly served French forces with very few Moroccans enrolled, let alone women. The school tried to contest her controversial enrollment, and she faced detractors at every turn.  Despite the obstacles, Chaoui was determined to pursue her dream and obtained her aviation license a year later at 15. Her achievement did not go unnoticed. Sultan Mohammed V gave her an award at the royal palace, and she made headlines across the world. However, as her success grew, so did her enemies. Moroccan historian Abdul Haq Almareni wrote that there were several failed assassinations attempts against Chaoui by French colonizers. According to Almareni, one colonizer put a bomb near the door of her villa, but his attempt failed. He also wrote that two French policemen shot at her in 1955 but failed to hit their target. However, in 1956, unknown perpetrators successfully assassinated Chaoui as she was preparing to fly her private plane to Saudi Arabia. Her cruel murder at the young age of 19 broke hearts across the nation. Although her life was short, her story lives on and inspires women and girls over 60 years later. Aicha Chenna, dedicated advocate  Aicha Chenna dedicated her life to aiding Morocco’s disadvantaged women. Born in 1941, Chenna spent her childhood Marrakech and grew up to found the Female Solidarity Association (ASF). When she was just 3 her father died, and her mother remarried. Her step-father pressured her to discontinue her education and at the age of 12, wear a headscarf and fill the traditional gender role of the time. Her mother daringly ignored his demands and sent Chenna to Casablanca to finish her high school studies. Three years later, her mother divorced her conservative husband and joined Chenna in Casablanca, selling her jewelry to support herself and her daughter. At just 16, Chenna left school and took a job at a prestigious hospital as a social-medical assistant, wanting to provide for herself and her mother. One of her colleagues, noticing how bright and competent she was, heavily encouraged her to take nursing exams, even offering to pay the school fees if she passed. After receiving her nursing diploma, Chenna began working for the Ministry of Public Health giving hygiene workshops. While giving the workshops at orphanages, she became touched by the plight of abandoned children and decided to become a social worker with a focus on family planning—which was controversial at the time, unwed mothers, and other disadvantaged women.  Hearing the tragic stories of the women whose lives had been riddled by violence and inequality every day took a toll on Chenna, so she decided to dedicate her life and everything she had to their cause. In 1985, she founded the Female Solidarity Association (ASF.) The association aimed to help disadvantaged, abused women and unwed mothers by training them in accounting, sewing, and whatever other skills they would need to become employable and independent. Despite the good she was doing for the world, Chenna had no shortage of conservative critics, who claimed her work “legitimized immoral behavior.” One government official even said Chenna should be stoned, and she received an assassination threat in 2000. Chenna’s work also garnered praise. That same year, King Mohammed VI gave her both an award and financial support. In 2009, she received the Opus award, becoming the first Muslim to ever receive the faith-based humanitarian award. Chenna pledged that the $1 million prize money would be used to ensure the foundation would live on after her death. She is currently 78 years old, living in Casablanca, and still advocating for the rights’ of those most disadvantaged.  Chenna’s lifelong dedication for the cause she believed in makes her one of the most admirable Moroccan women. Leila Slimani  Leila Slimani is a writer and journalist born in 1983 in Rabat. She grew up in a French-speaking household and attended French-speaking schools, so when she was 17, she left Rabat for Paris, where she studied political science and media studies at the Sciences Po and ESCP Europe.  After graduating, Slimani began working as a journalist for Jeune Afrique and married a French banker. The job required her to travel a lot, and in 2011, after having given birth to a son and getting arrested in Tunisia for reporting on the Arab Spring, she quit her journalism job and decided to write a novel. Slimani struggled initially and had her first novel rejected by publishers, but through persistence and writing courses, she released her first published novel, “In the Garden of the Ogre,” in 2014 with Gallimard, France’s most prestigious publisher. The novel received La Mamounia’s Literary Award. Slimani was the first woman to ever win the award, and from there, her international acclaim only grew. Just two years later, Slimani published the psychological thriller “The Perfect Nanny,” which won the extremely prestigious Goncourt Prize, solidifying her place as an internationally renowned author. The book was also the most read book in France that year. In 2017, Slimani published the incredibly controversial book “Sex and Lies: Sexual Life in Morocco.” She wrote the book based off of interviews with women she conducted while on a book tour in Morocco, when they shared their most intimate daily struggles with her. Despite the controversial nature of her books, Slimani’s influence is clear. In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron named the Moroccan-born author France’s top emissary for Francophone affairs. A year later, she was ranked second on Vanity Fair’s 2018 top 50 list of influential people in France, while the French president himself only ranked fifth. Slimani is a shining example of what can happen when you pursue your passion and are not afraid of breaking the norms.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Mounir Mahjoubi, the 35-year old Moroccan-French secretary of state for the Ministry of Digital Affairs, is running for office in the upcoming elections in Paris with Macron’s party. Mahjoubi, a web entrepreneur, told the French news outlet Parisien-Aujourd’hui that he “will be running for the 2020 municipal elections, along with other five politicians of La Republique En Marche.” Over the last few weeks, Mahjoubi has made numerous appearances in national and social media platforms across France, debating members of the yellow vests. Mahjoubi said he “has always had in mind the battle of France.”  In an interview with the French news agency Le Parisien, Mounir clearly stated his ambitions: “Today, I have a project and a strong willingness for Paris. Few dare say it. One must not have false modesty.” Talking about his vision, Mahjoubi said, “What’s particularly good about Paris is that it gives opportunities to everyone. It gave it to my father, a house painter, and my mother, a housewife, when they first arrived in Paris in the 1970s.” The politician expressed his concerns about Paris and the large number of people who leave Paris after having their first child. “Paris is the most beautiful city there is,” he said. “But there seems to be something wrong.” Regarding his first project, Mahjoubi said his priority is to provide housing for homeless people. As France has been grappling with yellow vest protests since November 2018, Mahjoubi took the initiative to open dialogue with protesters when other politicians stayed away from the streets.

Moroccan author Moha Ennaji has published a new book, “Child Brides in the Maghreb,” which compiles 10 chapters written by various experts on the subject.  Ennaji told Morocco World News the book seeks to assess the causes and consequences of child marriage in the Maghreb region, as well as how to combat the problem. The writers advocate that meeting sustainable development initiatives, particularly in terms of education, health, the fight against poverty, and gender equality, will help quell the social phenomenon.   Child marriage, widely recognized as a human rights violation, continues to be a problem in the Middle East and North Africa. A UNICEF report estimated in 2018 that the region is home to 40 million child brides and that one in five women in the region are married before age 18. Moha Ennaji, a professor of cultural and gender studies in Fez, edited the collective work, which was published by the South-North Center for Intercultural Dialogue in Fez. He starts off the book with a chapter arguing that the only way to combat the problem is to encourage female participation in all aspects of society.   The book takes an overall look at why child marriage is still occurring in the Maghreb region and the consequences it has on women and overall family wellbeing.   Several chapters discuss the weaknesses of the Moroccan Family code, known as the Moudawana. The book argues that Moudawana is still poorly understood, especially in rural areas, and still faces resistance. It also assesses the role judges and the legal system play in the fight against child marriage. Article 20 of the Family Code, in particular, was called into question. Article 20 allows parents to submit a waiver request to judges to allow the marriage or their underage child. One of the authors, Souad Slaoui, emphasized the need to modify Article 20 in order to reduce the rate of child marriage. She said the Family Code must be seriously implemented to ensure change.  The 10th and final chapter, written by Mina Sougrati, again argues that Article 20 of the Moudawana should have been repealed a long time ago. She stresses the urgency of its repeal.  A recent study found that the rates of child marriage in Morocco are increasing, despite attempts to turn the tide. According to the Moroccan High Commission of Planning, the number of waiver requests for minors increased to 41,669 in 2015, compared to 38,331 in 2007. Ninety-nine percent of the requests were for female minors. Among the requests made, notaries accepted 85 percent and rejected 15 percent.

Rabat – Camilla, the UK’s Duchess of Cornwall, attended an early St. Patrick’s Day dinner Wednesday evening at the Irish embassy in London. Camilla shined in her green caftan, a gift from King Mohammed VI she received during a royal visit to Morocco in 2011. She paired the caftan with nude high heels and accessorized with simple drop earrings.  The green dress is sequenced with elaborate trimming down the middle in the Moroccan style known as sfifa. It is the second time that Camilla is wearing the exquisite caftan; she first donned the same caftan in an event that her husband, Charles, prince of Wales, hosted at Buckingham Palace in February. After being invited by King Mohammed VI, Prince Charles and Camilla visited Morocco in 2011, an event that reaffirmed the historic relationship between the two countries. Camilla attended a vibrant caftan fashion show at Rabat’s Villa of Arts, during which she expressed enthusiasm for the traditional Moroccan garment.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) announced on Wednesday the extension of its women in business program in Morocco. The initiative aims to strengthen the Moroccan economy by supporting female entrepreneurs in Tangier, Tetouan-Al Hoceima, and the Oriental in northern Morocco.  Female entrepreneurs from the region often focus on the medical, retail, and service sectors. When it was implemented last year, the bank’s first women’s initiative in Morocco aimed to help more than 200 Moroccan women in its initial phase with financial and technical support. According to the EBRD director for Morocco, Marie-Alexandra Veilleux-Laborie, “This program will empower female entrepreneurs by helping women get access to finance and know-how.” Veilleux-Laborie stated that one challenge female entrepreneurs face is being unable to use the full range of bank services. To compensate, the European bank mentors women by offering technical support, business advice, and an opportunity to learn from each other. The project is funded by the EU Initiative for Financial Inclusion. In 2016, the EBRD’s managing director for the southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, Janet Heckman, signed a loan of €35 million with the Moroccan Bank for Foreign Trade (BMCE) and the Moroccan Bank for Trade and Industry (BMCI).  During the seven years that EBRD has invested in Morocco, it has financed 50 projects worth €1.7 billion.

Rabat – Morocco reserved a stand of over 340 square meters for its 27 exhibitors at the Berlin International Tourism Exchange (ITB) event held from March 6 to 10. This year, the Moroccan stand has a larger surface area in response to the growing interest of Moroccan professionals in the ITB. The Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) added 100 square meters to its stand, allowing more visibility for the various tourist regions in Morocco. Many tour operators, travel agents, booking sites, and hotels are taking part in the event. In 2018, 180,000 visitors and 10,000 exhibitors from 180 countries visited ITB Berlin. As of December 2018, 761,873 German tourists had visited Morocco compared to 2017, a 10 percent increase. The two countries have 45 air connections. Agadir is the main port of entry for German tourists, followed by Marrakech and Nador.

Rabat – A member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, Elena Valenciano, has said that the EU-Morocco fisheries and agriculture agreements are tools that will promote the “very important strategic relations between the two parties.” Valenciano made her remarks after meeting Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Thursday in Rabat. According to the EU committee member, Morocco is a key country for the EU’s “multidimensional relations with the rest of the world.” Valenciano said that her talks with Bourita were an “opportunity to celebrate agreements on the sectors of agriculture and fisheries that will strengthen the strategic relations between Morocco and the EU.” She also believes that the alliance between the two parties will be “very beneficial for Moroccans as well as for Europeans.” The European Parliament adopted the fisheries agreement and the agriculture deal in two separate plenary sessions on January 16 and February 12. The adoption of both agreements angered the Polisario Front, which again has complained that the EU-Morocco agreements violate the European Court of Justice’s jurisprudence. In February 2018, the ECJ ruled that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara to its adjacent waters.” However, the ECJ does not have jurisdiction over international agreements. In addition, the Moroccan government warned that it would not adopt any agreements with the EU against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Last month, the ECJ rejected Polisario’s request seeking to cancel the mandate granted to the EU Council to negotiate the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which includes the waters off Western Sahara. Quoting a pro-Polisario professor from Libre University of Bruxelles, Eric David, the news agency of the separatist group said March 6 that the agreements are a “real expression of contempt of the EU for international law whereas, as stated by the ECJ, the EU must exercise its powers in compliance with international law.” The EU’s bodies, along with Morocco, argue that the fisheries and agriculture agreements benefit Sahrawis in the southern provinces. After approving the fisheries agreement in March, the EU Council of Ministers said that the European Commission has assessed the deal’s potential impact on sustainable development, especially with regards to the people and the use of the natural resources of the southern provinces. The agreement, according to the council, is the “best guarantee for the sustainable use of the natural resources of waters adjacent to the southern provinces of Morocco.

By Stephanie Willman Bordat and Saida Kouzzi,  Rabat – Happy Pancake Day! It is time to check out a couple of online videos for some recipes. Oh wait, no, that was this past Tuesday, March 5. Today is International Women’s Day. It never fails. Every year around mid to late February, the calls and the e-mails start. “What are you doing for Women’s Day?” Sigh, bang head on table, repeat. As an NGO working for over 19 years to promote women’s rights in Morocco, Women’s Day is about roll-up-the-sleeves, slow but steady efforts 365 days a year, not a one-off occasion for a concocted activity. The first Women’s Day was organized—not celebrated—in 1909, and emerged from the labor rights movement, with women mobilizing for a host of political and economic rights related to voting and the right to be elected to public office, as well as worker’s rights and employment discrimination issues. Women across the world, from England to Egypt have been arrested at March 8 rallies, when the day was about protests, not promotions—of either the personal or the commercial kind.  On December 16, 1977, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution inviting member states to proclaim a “United Nations Day for Women’s Rights and International Peace” (emphasis added). To illustrate the rights-based context, on the same day the General Assembly also passed a resolution calling for a Draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Given the tendency of certain current political representatives in Morocco to denounce the CEDAW as neocolonialism from the “West,” it is worth recalling that the original request for a United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women was co-sponsored by 22 mostly African, Latin American, and Asian countries—one of which was Morocco. The original objectives of International Women’s Day were to highlight discrimination, inequality, and gender-based violence and organize concrete actions to address these violations of basic human rights. It is supposed to be a “lutte,” not a “fete.” At one memorable event long ago, a women’s group organized a bake sale in which women customers paid 65 percent of the prices men paid, to highlight experientially the wage gap between men’s and women’s earnings. In the decades since, Women’s Day has been transformed into a commercial opportunity to be exploited for sales. The day now focuses on women as gender-coded consumers and service providers, not on their fundamental rights as human beings. To these companies with their special deals, fanfare, and decorated window displays, we say, if you are not respecting labor laws, paying a fair wage, or guaranteeing minimal hygiene and safety standards for your female workers, then you have no business “celebrating” Women’s Day. (We have a sneaking suspicion that your staff may actually be worked unpaid overtime today to enhance sales). To add insult to injury, we have seen discussions circulating recently on social media where men complain that Women’s Day sales are a form of discrimination against them and a violation of their Article 19 constitutional rights. Discrimination is not just any difference made between people based on categories such as sex. It is a “distinction, exclusion or restriction” which has “the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.”  Studies have shown that women pay more for similar products than men—it is called the “pink tax.” In addition, since women earn less than men, they pay a higher percentage of their income than men for the same product. So in reality, it is the everyday prices that are discriminatory, not the one day sales. These products are often highly overpriced the other 364 days a year, with their profits more often than not going into the pockets of male CEOs, since in Morocco, women represent seven percent of administrators of the largest public enterprises and only 11 percent of listed companies. The CEOs’ nod to Women’s Day is to make less of a profit than usual off of women who earn less all year round. But please tell us again how you really wanted to buy that specific beauty cream today specifically and how the fact that you do not get the same discount as women for a 24 hour period is a violation of your fundamental human rights. Unfortunately, it is not just private profit-making entities lowering the bar on International Women’s Day.  Over the years, we have seen March 8 transformed by those who purport to support women’s rights—associations, the press, academics, activists, funders, and government representatives both domestic and foreign—into occasions for self-promotion. They plan last minute activities with no strategic objective hastily put together and built more around selfie opportunities than around rights-based advocacy.  In Morocco, seven out of 10 women will experience some form of gender-based violence in her lifetime. On average, women in Morocco spend five hours per day on domestic work and caretaking for other household members, compared to 43 minutes for men. Women make up only 17 percent of the 395-member House of Representatives and 12 percent of the 120-member House of Councilors. Moroccan women earn 29 percent less than men, and unemployment rates for women are double those for men. Consumer products, social media posts, and shameless self-promotion are not going to help address these issues constructively or advance women’s rights. Women in Morocco and around the world face serious problems that need solving. For this, as the saying goes, we need a movement, not a moment. In the meantime, rendez-vous on May 4 for Star Wars Day.

Rabat – Over 800,000 people acquired citizenship in an EU member state in 2017, and Moroccan citizens formed the “largest group” of those. According to a press release on European citizenship from the EU’s Eurostat, 67,900 Moroccans received citizenship in an EU state in 2017. Europe’s newest citizens largely acquired citizenship in the same countries as others from their birth country, possibly because of established immigrant populations there.  Most Moroccans, 83 percent, who became EU citizens, will now be calling a southwest European country their home. About one-third of them acquired Italian citizenship, one-quarter gained Spanish citizenship, and just under one-quarter are now French citizens. After Morocco, Albanians, Indians, and Turkish nationals made up the largest groups of nationals gaining citizenship in the EU. The overwhelming majority of the 58,900 Albanians who now have citizenship of an EU state are in Greece or Italy. More than half of the 31,600 Indians who now have EU citizenship got British passports. Similarly, half of the 20,000 Turkish nationals who gained EU citizenship have German passports. “Together, Moroccans, Albanians, Indians, Turks, Romanians, Pakistanis, Poles, and Brazilians accounted for about one third (34%) of the total number of persons who acquired the citizenship of a Member State of the EU in 2017.” According to Eurostat, 825,400 people obtained citizenship of an EU-28 member state in 2017. The numbers are actually a decrease of 17 percent compared with 2016. “The main contribution to the decrease at EU level came from Spain (84,400 less persons were granted Spanish citizenship than in 2016).” Italy also gave out 55,000 fewer  citizenships in 2017 than in 2016. However, Italy, along with the UK, Germany, France, and Sweden granted the most new citizenships in 2017. “Of those acquiring citizenship of an EU-28 Member State, 82 % had previously been citizens of non-EU countries,” the statistics explained. Moroccans leave because of unemployment Lack of job opportunities causes hundreds of young Moroccans to look for opportunities abroad. While some look for jobs abroad with their advanced degrees, others look for illegal ways to leave, risking their lives at sea. In January, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi acknowledged that more than 600 engineers leave Morocco every year. In addition to engineers, a survey by Moroccan marketing agency Sungeria found that four out of 10 Moroccans would leave Morocco if they were offered the opportunity. The study, which surveyed 1,000 people, also found that women were more inclined toward emigration than men.

Rabat – Berlin’s Leading Travel Trade Show (ITB) opened its doors yesterday and was marked by a large Moroccan delegation of tourism operators. The delegation has traveled all the way to Berlin from different Moroccan cities, including Fez, Agadir, and Marrakech, with the mission of promoting Morocco’s tourism. Morocco’s tourism promoters comprise travel agencies, hotel chains, airlines, and Regional Tourism Councils. The first day of the show saw an unprecedented number of 140,000 attendees from all over the globe. Attending the tourism symposium, tourism manager Younes Mendris told Morocco World News that “the Moroccan gallery has a lack of organization, along with the absence of the components that give an overall view on Moroccan culture and heritage such as a Gnawa band, or Andalusian music band.”  He emphasized that the Moroccan pavilion used to be much better in previous years. “In the first two days, a large number of Europeans visited the Moroccan gallery, especially Germans,” said Mendris. He added, “German tourism in Morocco is expected to grow.” ITB Berlin is the foremost business platform for global tourism offers, with an exhibition space of 150,000 square meters. Tourism operators criticize Royal Air Maroc  Although the ITB is of great importance to Morocco, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has shown a poor level of professionalism. Mendris also shared concerns over Morocco’s flag carrier with Morocco World News. A number of Moroccan tourism operators have condemned RAM’s “unprofessionalism” failing to transport travelers on time. On March 5, RAM canceled a direct flight from Casablanca to Berlin at the last moment without prior notice or clarification, leaving travelers furious. “A day before the opening of the show, RAM canceled the flight, without giving enough clarifications,” Mendris told MWN.  He added, “All it said is that it is working to secure another flight on March 9, three days after the opening of the ITB.” Mendris considers RAM’s attitude unacceptable and a blow to the tourism sector in Morocco, rather than a promotion. Mendris said that some were stuck in the airport while others found themselves obliged to look for other flights from different airlines. Although the flight was canceled, the tourism manager was surprised by the number of RAM representatives present in Berlin, which he considered “contradictory.” However, RAM told Morocco Word News that Casablanca-Berlin flight was not canceled on March 5. Travelers also complained about the high prices of tickets and the quality of services provided by RAM.

Rabat- FIFA has announced that it is considering Oman and Kuwait to host some of the games of the 2022 World Cup to be officially played in Qatar. The news comes as the footballing world’s highest authority plans to deliver in June on whether to extend the number of World Cup participation from 32 to 48 teams starting in 2022. FIFA had already reached a decision to extend the team count in 2026, but it is understood that FIFA president Gino Infantino is pushing for the extension to start as early as 2022.  Infantino is believed to favor extension earlier than planned because of the financial returns that such a move will yield for FIFA.  In public statements, however, the FIFA president is more eager to point out his desire to make the World Cup more inclusive. Extension, Infantino has maintained, will mean more teams from Africa and Asia, the two continents with the least representation in the event. The New York Times reported yesterday that a feasibility study on the possibility of extension in 2022 is underway. FIFA is currently conducting a feasibility study to decide whether Qatar can host an extended version of the tournament on its own. The Gulf crisis factor FIFA is expected to deliver its final verdict in June. Meanwhile, there is fear, even clear evidence, that it would be difficult for Qatar to host the event alone should participation be increased.  While the tiny Gulf country’s financial and infrastructure clout is beyond doubt, there are doubts that it can have enough hotels and stadiums to host the 48 delegations as well as the spectacularly high number of fans that usually travel to watch some of the event’s most exciting matches. A far greater fear, however, is the regional politics going on in the Gulf. Since June 2017, the region has been embroiled in a tense geopolitical fight between Qatar and the Saudi-led block—Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt.  The four countries declared a land, sea, and air blockade on Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorist groups. Qatar has rejected the accusations. While Kuwait and Oman have so far posed as neutral in the ongoing crisis, co-hosting the World Cup with Qatar may infuse already circulating suggestions that the two have been privately cozying up to Qatar.  Kuwait and Oman, Foreign Policy wrote in June 2018, “are stuck in [an] Arab no man’s land.” The two countries’ dilemma, Foreign Policy suggested, is that they are economically less fortunate than their Gulf neighbors, and appearing to pick sides will ignite the ire of the offended side. Qatar wants to be alone A final obstacle to Infantino’s plea for a co-hosted 2022 World Cup is Qatar’s perceived obstinacy with single-handedly organizing the World Cup. Doha fought to secure the hosting and does not seem eager to share the returns of a fight it fought alone. Although the Gulf state has not officially said so, Qatar relates to hosting the World Cup has as a big opportunity to make a resounding political statement.  Since the start of the spat, Doha has made numerous steps in a wide range of domains to show to its regional rivals that it can stand and thrive on the world stage despite their blockade. The country’s keenness to thrive in defiance of Riyadh and company has wakened suggestions that it may not welcome the prospect of co-hosting. Whether or not Qatar will yield to an extension move from FIFA is however not decided yet. In response to reports that it may have a potential co-host, Doha has remained reserved.  In an official statement this week, Qatar said it will make a decision once the FIFA-led feasibility study reaches its conclusion.

Rabat – While some congratulated and felt inspired by Yasmine Ouirhrane becoming this year’s Young European of the Year as a Muslim woman, others were too focused on her headscarf to notice her success, including Marine Le Pen. Yasmine Ouirhrane, 23, won Schwarzkopf Foundation’s 2019 European of the Year prize dedicated to young Europeans “who have worked in an honorary capacity towards the understanding between people or integration of Europe.” The fact that Ouirhrane is a veiled Muslim woman born to a Moroccan immigrant father and Italian mother did not please anti-Islamists or those against the “Islamisation of Europe.” The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen criticized the decision to award Ouirhrane, referring to the next elections to the European Parliament in France which will be held on 26 May 2019. She tweeted: “The European Union assumes its choices. On May 26, you’re the ones who will have to choose! For us, the promotion of radical Islam is a NO!” L’Union européenne assume ses choix. Le 26 mai, c’est vous qui devrez choisir ! Pour nous, la promotion de l’islam radical c’est NON !! MLP#OnArrive pic.twitter.com/y8NzzSFyp0 — Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) March 6, 2019  French politician and former journalist Robert Menard, the founder of Reporters without Borders (RSF) was not happy with the foundation’s decision to award  Ouirhrane. He tweeted on March 4: “Here is the young European model to the EU Parliament. Will the next one be behind a burqa?” Voilà la jeune européenne modèle pour le parlement de l’UE. La prochaine sera-t-elle derrière une burqa intégrale ? pic.twitter.com/PIX288zaC0 — Robert Ménard (@RobertMenardFR) March 4, 2019  Many Twitter users replied to Menard’s statement, some of them saying that he failed to see the real picture. Nicolas Cadene, the General Rapporteur of the National Observatory of Secularism in France, also tweeted in responde to Menard saying: “you only see the headscarf. Yasmine is first and foremost a student who lives between France and Italy, speaks 5 languages, and works for social integration, empowerment of immigrants’ children, and fights against extremism.” Vous ne voyez que le foulard. @yasmineojay, c’est d’abord 1 étudiante de @ScPoBx vivant en France et en Italie, parlant 5 langues, dont l’action pour l’inclusion sociale, l’autonomisation des enfants d’immigrés, et pour la lutte contre l’extrémisme est reconnue de tous#StopHaine https://t.co/uFQmuBrjyv — Nicolas Cadène (@ncadene) March 6, 2019  Ouirhrane speaks Italian, French, Arabic, English, and Spanish and has broad experience with the United Nations and other organizations empowering underprivileged youth and women and promoting education. She studied international relations at Sciences Po Bordeaux in Pessac, France and is an is an expert in peace and security at the AU-EU Youth Cooperation Hub, a multi-stakeholder initiative. She also works as an advocacy member at United Network of Young Peacebuilders, who led a delegation of 20 underprivileged students to attend the European Youth Event 2018. Ouirhrane also helped organize the European Youth Forum’s 2018 YOFest in Strasbourg.

Rabat – Nineteen organizations, unions, and associations, including UNICEF, Doctors of the World, Gisti, and Cimade, have launched a legal challenge to a French law that hardens foreign children’s conditions in France. On February 28, the organizations said they would oppose the French law, which aims to compile age assessments of unaccompanied minors into a single database. The new law enables departments responsible for child protection to send minors to prefectures for fingerprinting and determining identity.  In a press release published on UNICEF’s website, the NGOs stated why they are against the registration of minors.  “By collecting their personal data, fingerprints and pictures, and using them for migratory control purposes, the government will be able to expel these minors without considering their fundamental rights,” said the organizations. They pointed out that France intends to move young migrants as soon as possible, rather than welcoming them temporarily to stabilize and assess their conditions. The organizations also stated that the minors will not have any protective guarantee: They will have no psychosocial support, agents who take care of them are not trained, and the minors will be placed in the same areas as adults. The law reverses the “benefit of the doubt” principle regarding minors’ ages, and minors must communicate much personal information to authorities. If they refuse, their decision could be seen as a confession. The organizations said that “these regulations seriously undermines children’s rights. We consider that it is imperative that the French Council of state should ensure the respect of children’s rights as it is guaranteed by our Constitution.”  According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated as the CRC), France is committed to considering children’s interests in all its laws. However, the organizations argued that “children’s interests were not taken into account in this decree: their control and their remoteness seem to matter more for the government.” France passed the law in late January, and it is scheduled to go into effect in April.

Rabat – Wearing their black robes, hundreds of lawyers marched in the streets of Algiers on Thursday to back the waves of protests against Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s seeking a fifth term as president. Security forces monitored the lawyers’ peaceful demonstration while they shouted slogans like “Algeria is not a monarchy” and “The people want to overthrow the regime.” The Algerian National Association of Lawyers has called on authorities to postpone the election, scheduled for April 18, and set up an emergency government. Algeria is witnessing its biggest demonstrations since the 2011 Arab Spring, which have been continuing since February 22. The demonstration demanding Bouteflika step down after 20 years in power also has the support of several military veterans in the country. On Wednesday, Algerian independence war veterans also joined the protests. Some public figures also reportedly resigned from their positions in the government. Meanwhile, two branches of the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) hit the streets yesterday, representing thousands of workers. On Tuesday, thousands of students from several campuses across Algiers marched, responding to Bouteflika’s offer to leave within one year if he wins re-election, saying that they “cannot wait a second” for him to leave.

Rabat – Did Amina Maelainine have the right to drop her veil while in Paris? What are the implications of her act for her political party? And should the MP be ousted for a choice of attire that most people in the party’s Islamist platform find inconsistent with what they should stand for? These are some of the questions fusing a tense debate between different factions within the senior ranks of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD). In January, pictures went viral of Amina Maelainine, a female PJD MP, posing unveiled in front of well-known Parisian sites like the Moulin Rouge cabaret. Maelainine vehemently denied the authenticity of the pictures, claiming that they were part of a “slanderous” campaign” from her political adversaries. Faced with evidence, however, Maelainine later admitted that the pictures were real. But she urged people to separate her politics from her private life choices. The admission has since sparked controversies, both within the party and in the country’s conservative circles at large. The central fear is that cases such as Maelainine’s rob the Islamist party of its ethical and religious claims, the core of its politics and electorate. Within the PJD, former prime minister and PJD mogul Abdelilah Benkirane, who rose to Maelainine’s defense at the outset of the controversy, remains to this day the MP’s most ardent supporter. Having failed to convince the party leadership to accommodate Maelainine’s right to separate her political and personal convictions, Benkirane is now resorting to Islamic rhetoric to defend his protegee, Moroccan outlet Al Akhbar reported yesterday. In an alleged letter to Morocco’s current head of government and PJD secretary general, Saad Eddine El Othmani, Benkirane pointed out that ousting Maelainine would not benefit the party’s image. According to the newspaper, Benkirane argued that, should the PJD oust Maelainine, she will be left “helpless and defenseless at the mercy of her detractors and enemies,” who according to Benkirane happen to also be PJD’s ideological and political adversaries. Benkirane purportedly argued that, as an Islamist party, the PJD should seize the Maelainine affair as an opportunity to illustrate its belief in compassion and forbearing as Islam preaches. “You should always come to the rescue of your brethren, whether they be the oppressed or the oppressor,” the former PM said in the alleged letter. He cited an Islamic hadith that encourages believers to practice sympathy and forgiveness, even toward those who may not deserve it. El Othmani and human rights minister Mustapha Ramid have been among the harshest critics of Maelainine’s Paris pictures. “The party’s commitment to its Islamic repository is an exercise and not an illusion, we must ensure that we are always attached to it,” El Othmani said in late January as the Maelainine controversy gained momentum. Addressing accusations of “hypocrisy” that many critics were quick to level at the party, El Othmani expressed displeasure with Maelianine. He said, “We must set an example, especially those who are at the forefront of public opinion.” Even harsher than El Othmani, Ramid has insistently called for the party to dismiss the “guilty” MP. He suggested on multiple occasions that the PJD has its Islamist reputation and conscience to uphold in cases involving MPs with “two faces… whose clothes clash now with the principles on which they campaigned and were elected.” The party has not yet reached a decision. But it remains to be seen whether Benkirane’s hadith-flavored plea will prevail over the PJD’s perceived determination to once and for all put to rest recurring criticism of hypocrisy and double standards.

Rabat – Despite a security crackdown on their February 20 protest, contractual teachers are determined to continue their protests against lack of “social dialogue” negotiations with government. Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi commented on the situation yesterday at a press conference about Regional Academies of Education and Training Senior Teachers (AREF). Amzazi said the government recruited teachers by contract with an aim at “improving the regional academies as public institutions with administrative and financial autonomy and controlling their human resources.” Protests swept the country as teachers are holding six days of sit-ins in all regional education academies in Tetouan, Kenitra, Fez, Agadir, and Casablanca. The regional academies also allegedly cut the teachers’ salaries for absenteeism and protesting last year. Some protesters in Rabat were invited to sleep in the headquarters of the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) while protesting, a source told Morocco World News yesterday. Amzazi said that the government adopted a special status as of September 1, 2018 to secure the administrative professional career of AREF senior teachers.  “The status provides the rights and obligations relating to basic and continuous training, social protection and motivation throughout the career.” Amzazi also added that the recruitment of  teachers nu cp,tracts os a, irreversivel strategic choice.” “The ministry is willing to improve the new status of AREF employees, whenever necessary, in order to improve the quality of education and guarantees teachers the necessary stability and motivation.” The ministry added that all recruited teachers were informed of all the clauses contained in the contract they signed and committed themselves voluntarily. The contract, according to Amzazi, makes it clear that the teachers are not allowed to join public service. Earlier this month, the National Federation of Teachers (UMNT) called on the ministry to provide fair and urgent solutions for contractual teachers to end the tension. The federation also accused the government of “discriminating between teachers for a fixed term.” Contractual teachers also complained that without being integrated into the public sector, they do not get access to health coverage and the pension fund.

Rabat – As talks of diplomatic normalizatıon stall between Morocco and Israel, some Israeli citizens have decided to move ahead of the languishing political dialogue between the two countries. They are resorting to buying counterfeit Moroccan IDs. Members of the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested ten people on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of having links to a criminal network.

The group was arrested on the basis of information provided by the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST).

The group has allegedly been active in falsifying official documents in order to grant Moroccan citizenship.

According to a statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), among the suspects arrested in this case were a Jewish Moroccan, three police officers, a public officer, an administrative attache, and a commercial agent from a travel agency.

Others are suspected of complicity in facilitating the criminal acts.

The statement added that the modus operandi of the network, which is managed by the Jewish Moroccan, consists in falsifying contracts to help Israeli citizens of non-Moroccan origin obtain false evidence to register in Morocco’s civil register.

The leader of the group then applies for authorization to register civil status and obtain false birth certificates for people of Jewish faith.

The main suspect in the criminal network sought to procure Moroccan passports for illegitimate purposes for his clients, according to police. In exchange, he receives between $5,000 and $7,000.

His supposed accomplices include police officers, enforcement officers, and public officials. The news comes amid reports of prospective diplomatic normalization between Morocco and Israel. Some Moroccan civil society groups have slammed the reports, pointing to the North African country’s unflinching support for the Palestinian cause. But the lack of diplomatic ties between the Morocco and Israel does not whitewash the considerably positive feeling that Morocco elicits to thousands of Moroccan Jews, despite the complex history. Around 10,000 Moroccan Jews are believed to be currently living in Morocco. And while that number is far below the 265,000 that the country hosted at some point around World War II, the emotional attachment to Morocco cannot be said to have waned. In November 2018, a number of prominent Jewish Moroccan artists convened in Marrakech to celebrate their Moroccanness and pay tribute to “beautiful memories” of a “shared heritage.” “I am first and foremost a Moroccan,” said one of the artists.

 Rabat – Following contractual teachers’ protests in Rabat February 18-20, which left many injured, teachers are staging another week-long protest this week. Security forces had used water cannons, truncheons, and batons to push protesters back. Starting March 6, a number of Moroccan cities are seeing large numbers of contractual teachers taking to the street in protest of what they called “discrimination and injustice.” The teachers are speaking out about the government’s “disregard” for their demands. One protesting teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Morocco World News, “We signed the contract, one clause of which states that upon passing the qualification exam after two years of teaching experience, the contract shall renew itself automatically each year.” However, the teacher said the government did not administer a qualification exam for teachers hired in 2016. Instead, they were asked to sign an addendum to the contract. The teacher explained that the addendum “was not part of the first agreement. This document shall not grant incumbents full integration into the academy. Rather, it curtails their rights and does not put them on equal footing with permanent teachers.” Brought together by the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) and the National Federation of Teachers (UMNT), contractual teachers are engaging in a 6-day sit-in in several cities across Morocco, including Kenitra, Casablanca, Tetouan, Oujda, Errachidia, and Marrakech.

The two unions published a leaflet outlining the goals of the sit-in and listing why they are protesting. Teachers say the contract contradicts the aims of the International Labour Organization, as stipulated in the declaration of its 26th session on May 10, 1944, in Philadelphia.

The groups listed two demands: “(a) full employment and the raising of standards of living; (b) the employment of workers in the occupations in which they can have the satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill and attainments and make their greatest contribution to the common well-being.”
 At the political level, teachers said they are protesting because plans for the actual contract were not outlined in the election campaigns of either coalition parties or those in opposition and, therefore, were imposed “undemocratically.” Legislative bodies, teachers representatives, and the union did not take part in the decision making. Contractual teachers particularly object to the contract’s contentious clauses 4 and 13, which seemingly hands sweeping powers to “employers.” Now the academies pay contractual teachers. The contract can be terminated by academy higher-ups, like inspectors and directors, “to whose whims teachers on fixed-term contract are subject.” “They can terminate the contract without prior notice if they saw them unfit for the position,” a contractual teacher who wanted to be referred to by the initials A.A., explained. Teachers, however, can break the contract only after a one-year period. Clause 4 states that teachers are not entitled to be integrated into the public service sector. Teachers felt they “had no option but to sign the contract, given the high rate of unemployment and promises that they would be granted full integration upon signing the addendum,” which “blatantly contradicts clause 4.” However, to the teachers’ dismay, the contract is just another “instrument that will further put teachers under the thumb of academies,” A.A. argued. Teachers want the government to guarantee their right to protest, a constitutional right, and disapprove of not being paid because of their protests. Some teachers allege that they were not paid their month’s wages in February because they staged protests. Contractual teachers regard the contract provisions as “discriminatory” because they do not put them on par with permanent teachers. For example, contractual teachers do not get healthcare and pension benefits or the option to change jobs within academy ranks. The CNPCC expressed its support for protesting teachers in a statement of solidarity yesterday. They offered that protesting teachers could sleep overnight in their headquarters. “We are trying to pressurize the government to redress this problem: To abandon the contract and grant us, without prejudice, our rights. We want to enjoy a sense of financial, psychological, and social stability,” A.A. emphasized.

Rabat – Lionel Messi, who was expected by many of his fans, is unlikely to play in the Argentina-Morocco friendly on March 26 in Tangier.

In spite of a likely invitation from the Argentinian coach, Lionel Scaloni, the Barca star might not play the friendly match after all, according to Spanish newspaper Marca.

Marca said the player would like to preserve his strength for the Catalan derby against Espanyol four days later. Lionel Messi wants to be in his best physical condition for that game. He also wants to be in his best shape for the rest of the Champions League, especially after Barcelona eliminated the French club of Lyon.

The news confirms the information reported a few days earlier by ESPN.

Coach Herve Renard of the Moroccan team and Scaloni are expected to announce today a list of players who will be invited to the upcoming FIFA matches.

Argentina will face Venezuela in Spain on March 22 before heading to Morocco. Just yesterday, new conditions emerged regarding Morocco’s friendly football match with Argentina. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) agreed the Atlas Lions must not be ruthless in taking the ball from Lionel Messi.  FRMF was also said to have to pay MAD 10 million to the Argentine governing body for Messi to play in Morocco. FRMF also required that Messi play no fewer than 60 minutes.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The Diplomatic Foundation in Rabat hosted an event on March 6 to honor the women ambassadors to Morocco, 12 of whom attended the event.  By noon, the first of the 150 attendees began arriving slowly at Rabat’s Sofitel Hotel. Each of the twelve women ambassadors arrived dressed in casual clothes to emerge later in traditional Moroccan caftans, an homage to Moroccan women’s fashion just two days before International Women’s Day. More than 30 ambassadors responded to the foundation’s invitation to take part in the event. In a hall with brightly-lit chandeliers creating a lighthearted and welcoming atmosphere, attendees interacted with each other in whatever common language they shared, from Japanese and English to French and Bulgarian. The two-hour event began with a 30-minute ceremony in which the Diplomatic Foundation’s executive chairman, Abdelati Habek, presented Moroccan caftans to ambassadors, who traded in their usual clothes to be attired in caftans in tribute to all Moroccan women. Bulgarian Ambassador Briana Simeonova told Morocco World News: “This is the third time that I participate in such an event, and I am proudly wearing this caftan because it was made by the hand of Moroccan craftswomen, and it’s an art.” Moroccan Secretary of State for Sustainable Development Nezha El Ouafi agreed. Asked about the importance of Moroccan caftans, she answered, “The Moroccan caftan highlights the rich Moroccan history because it represent a culture beyond the borders.” And, she suggested, caftans’ importance go beyond their beautiful design. El Ouafi stated, “Craftsmanship is a wide and creative sector that contributes to an economic growth and provides a big portion of the Moroccan people with the opportunity to maintain the Moroccan heritage.” But the event was also about more than just caftans. During the ceremony, Moroccan Secretary of State to the Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts, Social Economy, Handicrafts, and Social Economy Jamila El Moussali told MWN, “This occasion gives Morocco the opportunity to develop our strategies.” El Moussali cited a World Bank report, saying, “Morocco ranks the first in terms of women’s rights in the MENA region. For us, these achievements give a sense of pride. And we are looking forward to more initiatives that will provide help to the Moroccan woman.” In the second part of the ceremony, Habek formally opened the event by taking a picture with some of distinguished women present, capturing their solidarity despite their different nationalities.  Before giving the floor to the women ambassadors, Habek announced, “We are here to pay tribute to all women, regardless of their status and conditions: Housewives, single mothers, workers, military, police, fighters, pilots of airliners, ministers, heads of government, or heads of state.” Most of the women ambassadors took the floor to paint a picture of the progress women have achieved in their respective countries, while paying tribute to women’s rights efforts in Morocco. The women ambassadors congratulated Morocco for its women’s rights achievements and praised King Mohammed VI for being an advocate of women’s rights. Jamila El Moussali took the stage first, noting the importance of Moroccan caftans, which have been “transformed into an ambassador of the Moroccan culture.” El Moussali continued, “Honoring Moroccan caftans is honoring female artisans.” Women’s day, she said, “honors the contributions that women make in every sector.” Presenting the situation in Europe, Ambassador Simeonova dwelt on the situation of women Bulgaria. According to the ambassador, almost 50 percent of Bulgarian judges are women, the country’s vice president is a woman, and “their presence changed governance, social management and led to reasonable compromises.” Argentine Ambassador Gloria Young spoke of the importance of feminism. “The empowerment that women have achieved throughout the years,” she argued, is the result of “the feminist movements that pushed the government to push the agenda.” Young spoke of women’s participation in Latin America, saying, “Women’s participation in political affairs is still low, women make up only 70 percent of the university population in Panama.” But, she stated, Women’s Day is an opportunity for women and generations to come together to achieve equality. Along with the secretaries of state, multiple high-ranking Moroccans attended the event: the wife of the head of government, Madame El Othmani; the general secretary of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), Nabila Mounib; and the minister of solidarity, women, family, and social development, Bassima Hakkaoui.

Rabat – Europe’s migration crisis is over, the EU’s Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said Wednesday. He predicted that “misinformation, untruths and fake news” could dominate the campaign for the upcoming European elections in May.

“The times of crisis, when hundreds of thousands of people were coming by sea to Italy and Greece are behind us,” Dimitris Avramopoulos told reporters. Migration to the EU has returned to more moderate levels not seen since 2013, he added.

However, he acknowledged that migration is still at the top of the political agenda and will be a high profile issue in many election campaigns across Europe in the run-up to the European elections.

Speaking about migration to the EU, Avramopoulos said, “Misinformation, untruths, and fake news” make it “hard to know what is actually going on.”

The number of asylum applications in the EU dropped to 634,700 in 2018, down by 10 percent compared to 2017, according to European Asylum Support Office data published in February.  Asylum applications peaked at the height of the crisis with 1.4 million in 2015 and 1.3 million in 2016.

Yet, despite falling levels of migration, people still perceive high levels. Forty percent of Europeans consider immigration to be a main problem facing the EU, according to Eurobarometer.

While a planned reform of the EU’s asylum policy has been at a standstill for a year, the EU has sought new partnerships with North African countries on the model of the migrant control agreement it made with Turkey in 2015. Avramopoulos praised Morocco in particular.

“It is clear that we need to strengthen our relationship with Morocco,” said Avramopoulos. He called on the EU to develop a closer and more ambitious partnership with Morocco. The EU and Morocco last autumn agreed on a €140 million program to strengthen border security in Morocco. The next elections to the European Parliament are scheduled to take place between May 23 and 26.

Since 1979, the majority of seats in the European Parliament have gone to either the Christian-Democrats/Conservatives or the Socialists/Social Democrats.

The center-right group of the European People’s Party is likely to remain the dominant political force in the European Parliament, according to Politico. However, populist parties made strong representations during the last elections and the next European Parliament might well reflect this trend.

Rabat – Spanish consulates issued a total of 220,929 visas in Morocco in 2018, significantly higher than the usual numbers recorded annually. According to Spanish news outlet EFE, the number is higher than it has been in more than a decade. Typically, Spain issues between 140,000 and 180,000 in Morocco. The increase means Morocco received more Spanish visas in 2018 than any other country except Russia and China. According to the Spanish news outlet, which received data from the Diplomatic Information Office, Spanish consulates in Morocco issued an average of 1,000 visas a day, excluding weekends and holidays. In addition to the Spanish embassy in Rabat, Morocco has six Spanish consulates across the country: Tangier, Tetouan, Casablanca, Nador, Agadir, and Laraache. More than 200,000 Moroccans hold Spanish citizenship, while over 1 million Moroccans live in Spain, EFE reported in February. In 2018, 770,523 Morocans lived as residents in Spain, while another  undocumented quarter million are staying in Spain. The news outlet added that at least 180,000 Moroccan children attend Spanish schools. Spaniards also represent a significant portion of foreign tourists in Morocco. Tourists from Spain were the second most common nationality at 20 percent, and France was the most common with 31 percent. Spain and Morocco maintain strong diplomatic ties, which were recently on display in a Spanish royal visit. In February, King Felipe VI and his wife Queen Letizia of Spain arrived in Morocco at the request of King Mohammed VI. The visit sought to reinforce diplomatic bonds, reflecting the quality of bilateral ties thanks to the shared will to foster the partnership between the two countries, according to the Moroccan Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery.

Rabat – With eyes set on “changing the face of migration,” Ouirhrane has won Schwarzkopf-Stiftung’s Young European of the Year prize. The Schwarzkopf Foundation award the prize to young Europeans aged between 18 and 26 “who have worked in an honorary capacity towards the understanding between people or integration of Europe.” The award’s €5,000 prize is “intended to finance a six-month internship with a Member of the European Parliament or at another European institution.”   Still, Ouirhrane’s winning did not escape criticism from anti-Islamist Europeans and people who paid more attention to her headscarf than her accomplishments. Robert Menard, the founder of Reporters without Borders (RSF), tweeted on March 4 following her awarding: “Here is the young European model to the EU Parliament. Will the next one be behind a burqa?” Voilà la jeune européenne modèle pour le parlement de l’UE. La prochaine sera-t-elle derrière une burqa intégrale ? pic.twitter.com/PIX288zaC0 — Robert Ménard (@RobertMenardFR) March 4, 2019  Ouirhrane is a strong-willed young woman who advocates for youth, peace, and security, as well as for equitable access to education and political opportunities for people from different backgrounds. Born to an Italian mother and a Moroccan immigrant father, Ouirhrane understands what it is like to not feel “included’ in her own society. “I have struggled all my life to feel included and accepted in my society,” Ouirhrane said when she received the award. Ouirhrane’s life experience did not weaken her but rather made her stronger and more committed to “building blocks for European unity, as I advocate for gender equality, social justice and countering violent extremism.” To Ouirhrane, “the award symbolises a milestone and a step forward towards inclusion for all young European citizens.” She added that the award symbolizes a “collective win: for young women, for immigrants daughters, for Europe, for Unity in Diversity, for change, tolerance, respect of the other, for peace. Ouirhrane’s message to all young Europeans who wish to feel “included” in their society and need hope is: “We are European too, today more than ever.” Ouirhrane has rich experience with the United Nations and other organizations empowering underprivileged youth and women and promoting education.

By Brendan Ng Boston – For two weeks now, thousands of Algerians have taken to the streets in cities across the country and beyond to protest the announcement that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika intends to seek a fifth term in office. In the past few days, the voices of activists and student protestors have been picked up by global media as many around the world struggle to comprehend the unbelievable series of events that have led up to this latest wave of very public outcry. A grasp of this history reveals the incredible crossroads Algeria finds itself at today, as these street protests have come to represent nothing less than a battle for the country’s political soul. While many remain hopeful of a brighter future to come, there is significant reason for caution. Before understanding today’s protests, however, it is first necessary to understand the events that have taken place over the course of Bouteflika’s time in power. Abdelaziz Bouteflika became president in 1999, presiding over the final years of Algeria’s bloody civil war. When the war finally ended in 2002, he continued ruling with significant support from traditional elites and a war-weary public. At the time, many expected that a stable Algeria would prosper with its substantial holdings of oil and natural gas. While the post-war period has been prosperous for a select few—notably, elites in Bouteflika’s regime known as “le pouvoir”—many Algerians are struggling. Recent data shows unemployment rates to be astoundingly high for young people: 26.4 percent for people under the age of 30 (around two-thirds of the country’s total population). Politically, things have been deteriorating since 2013, when Bouteflika suffered a stroke and lost the physical and mental capacity to fulfill his presidential duties. That is why in the past few weeks, many Algerians were shocked and horrified by an announcement that Bouteflika would seek a fifth term in office.  A core motivation behind the protests is the concept of “hogra”—a mark of contempt, insult to honor and general belittlement. Ordinary people feel as if this latest announcement from Bouteflika’s inner circle is an insult, and compounded with the decades of rule-bending and inequitable leadership Algeria has suffered through over the past decade, it has crossed a line. One of the basic rules for candidates seeking presidential election is to personally turn in their forms to the administration. In his rapidly deteriorating physical state, however, Bouteflika is not even able to leave his Swiss hospital bed, much less return to Algiers with official documents.  Thus, Bouteflika’s decision to run for president is an extremely transparent move by the ruling elite (including the president’s brother Said) to cling to their positions of power even as Bouteflika is clearly not well enough to serve as an effective head of state. This indignity proved too much for many Algerians.  The protests are an important shift because they are breaking an implicit contract between the regime and the Algerian people. The source of the regime’s power has been its ability to offer stability to a country that desperately needed it after a horrific civil war. This stability came at a high price, however, as the government and those in power made no substantial efforts towards systematic change in a country that has become increasingly economically imperiled. Algerians today face an impossible decision. Considering their position in a regional context with memories of the Arab Spring looming large, it is impossible to overstate the value of stability—Algerian people are no doubt looking at Syria as an example of what can happen when an authoritarian regime chooses to stand its ground against a popular protest movement. Simultaneously, however, it is clear that Algerians have reached a breaking point. The protestors in Algiers and across the country are certainly familiar with the military’s less-than-peaceful track record of dealing with protests, but are still taking to the streets on an enormous scale. The level of corruption being challenged is systemic, but those in power seem hell-bent on continuing along with business as usual. Earlier this week, notable Bouteflika loyalist and Army Chief of Staff Ahmed Gaid Salah gave a speech directed towards protestors, threatening, “There are parties who wish to bring Algeria back to the years of violence … A people that defeated terrorism knows how to preserve the stability and security of its nation.” As government officials and top military leaders appear prepared to dig in their heels against any efforts towards systemic reform and protestors show no signs of slowing down, Algeria has come to a day of reckoning. For how much longer will the country cling to a tenuous stability if that stability comes at the cost of the nation’s dignity?

Rabat – Police in Sale, near Rabat, arrested a vendor of peanuts on Monday after finding in his possession dozens of top-secret government documents. The documents, signed and stamped by several Moroccan ministers, contained information about Morocco’s cooperation with many foreign countries. Police do not know how the vendor obtained the documents. One of the documents the vendor had was from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, signed and stamped by energy minister Aziz Rebbah, putting the ministry in an embarrassing position. On Monday, the energy ministry released a statement admitting that some of its documents were exposed. The ministry stressed that it deals with administrative files in accordance with legal and administrative rules while preserving the confidentiality of content. The ministry also launched an investigation into the leak.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP group and Spain’s ACS Group have signed two contracts to build two factories in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca, which will cost €255 million, approximately MAD 2.8 billion, announced ACS on Tuesday. The contracts to build the factories “have been awarded by the OCP (Office Chériffien de Phosphates), following a tender process where several international engineering companies have taken part,” said ACS, an international civil and engineering construction company. Construction on the projects has already begun and will take another two to three years for each before they are ready to operate.  The projects will be two of the largest sulfuric acid plants in the world. ACS will build the facilities and implement the processing of two 5,000 tons of sulfuric acid per day, in addition to implementing basic engineering, detailed engineering, and equipment and material supply works. The sulfuric acid will be mainly used in the manufacture of granulated phosphate fertilizers. The energy the two plants generate will be used in Jorf Lasfar, “almost eliminating the necessity of resorting to external electrical power.” The plants will also optimize the production of phosphate fertilizers to support the agricultural industry in African mainland countries. Founded in 1997, the Madrid-based ACS Group is a leading construction company worldwide with projects in many countries, operating in key services and sectors, including telecommunications.  Meanwhile, Morocco’s OCP Group, which holds 75 percent of the world’s phosphate reserves, is one of the leading exporters and producers of raw phosphate, phosphate-based fertilizers, and phosphoric acid in the world.

Rabat – Danish police have charged 14 people for sharing a video that purportedly shows the killing of one of the murdered Scandinavian tourists near Imlil, a popular tourism destination in the Atlas Mountains near Mount Toubkal in Morocco. Six teenagers, at least one as young as 13, and eight adults received charges for sharing the graphic footage on Facebook Messenger or other social media. Danish television channel TV2 reported that the suspects range between the ages of 13 to 69. According to Danish law, sharing such videos is illegal and is “offensive to both victims and relatives.” The television channel also called on people to not to watch or share the video. “It is important to talk to our children and young people about what offensive films and images are and that they must be deleted and never shared,” said the head of the police’s National Prevention Center, Tenna Wilbert. In January, Danish public prosecutor Kirsten Dyrman complained that many people in Denmark were sharing the video. Dyrman also warned that sharing the video may be a punishable offence. The Norwegian government also urged people not to download and share the graphic footage. Moroccan authorities found the bodies of the Scandinavian tourists, Maren Ueland from Norway and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark, on December 17 near Imlil. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that people should “support” the victims relatives by abstaining from spreading the video. She added that people have even posted the video on her own Facebook page. Norway’s Kripos police said in a statement that they conducted their own investigation into the murders. “Kripos has a desiree to give … as many answers as possible about what happened and has collaborated and exchanged information with the Danish police. Work is still ongoing,” the statement added. Norway’s police also worked to prevent further spreading of the video. “We have contacted service providers to get the film removed. In some cases, we have also been in direct contact with individuals or administrators.” The police said that the movie “cannot be completely removed from the internet, but we have wanted to limit the scope as much as possible.” Police also warned that watching the footage could affect people who see it, especially children and young people. Kripos noted that Norway has not charged any individual for sharing the video because Norwegian law differs from Danish law. “However, the sharing of the video according to the circumstances can also implicate Norwegian penal provisions, which will have to be considered specifically in each case. In December, Norwegian police said they had no reason not to believe that the video, which depicted a decapitation, was not of the murders. Morocco’s security services arrested 23 suspects in connection to the murder. All of the suspects have appeared before the investigating judge, but the trials are still ongoing.

By Sydney McCourt Rabat – Forty-seven-year-old Rachid Nekkaz attempted to register in Algiers on Sunday for the 2019 presidential election with the Constitutional Council. But, a few hours later, it was not Nekkaz but another man of the same name who announced his candidacy to the press. This other Rachid Nekkaz, a mechanic by trade, is none other than the cousin and namesake of the original Nekkaz. In a Facebook post, (the better known) Nekkaz detailed his surreal plan. He made it clear that his cousin’s candidacy is a “Plan B,” implemented after the Constitutional Council refused to validate his candidacy on the basis of 2016 constitutional reforms which blocked any candidates who had ever held a nationality other than Algerian.   Nekkaz proceeded to outline the timeline of his ideal political scenario. First, the Constitutional Council must validate his cousin’s candidacy on March 13. At that time, Nekkaz would officially become his cousin’s campaign manager. Second, if his cousin is elected, the cousin would immediately seek a parliamentary vote to create the position of vice president which Nekkaz would occupy. Finally, his cousin would step down as president-elect, allowing Nekkaz to take over what he believes is his rightful position. Nekkaz explained that “the meaning of my cousin’s candidacy is symbolic, just as Bouteflika’s candidacy is symbolic.” The campaign is an attempt to maintain pressure on Abdelaziz Bouteflika as he runs for a widely-contested fifth term. Nekkaz is one of the most outspoken opponents of Bouteflika. He has marched in numerous protests, and in February was beaten and violently thrown out of a protest by police forces. Notoriety as an activist Nekkaz gained recognition largely from his activity across the Mediterranean, in France. He dedicated himself to the defense of women in France who wore the burqa. He founded an organization called “Do Not Touch My Constitution” (Touche Pas a Ma Constitution) which pledged to pay the fine of any women arrested for wearing the burqa in public. Nekkaz is also known for political stunts. On one occasion, he dumped 10,000 €1 coins in front of the Socialist Party Headquarters to protest the €1 membership fee required of activists. On another, he bought the endorsement of the mayor of Noron-la-Poterie in an auction and proceeded to tear it up on live television to protest the practice of buying endorsements which he viewed as giving “a bad image to democracy.” Such stunts and activism have made Nekkaz particularly popular among young people in Algeria. When he was travelling throughout Algeria to collect the necessary 60,000 signatures for his candidacy in the months leading up to 2019, he attracted crowds of supporters. Nekkaz engages with his supporters regularly on Facebook where he has more than 1.5 million followers. Nekkaz’s political past The 2019 election is by no means Nekkaz’s first foray into the political scene. It is the third time and second country in which Nekkaz has failed in a bid for presidency. In 2007 Nekkaz attempted to run for president in France but was only able to acquire 13 of the necessary 500 endorsements. Following this failed attempt, Nekkaz created his own political party to run in the 2007 legislative elections. Running in the 7th district of Seine-Saint-Denis, he won only 156 votes—0.5 percent of the ballot. Undeterred, Nekkaz ran again in the 2008 municipal elections but lost despite promising €300 to every voter if he were elected. In 2014, Nekkaz turned his gaze from France to Algeria. He gave up his French nationality and announced a bid for president of Algeria. In a blog post on the site for his organization “Don’t Touch My Constitution,” he explained his decision to renounce his French citizenship and claim only his Algerian identity: “‘Between my mother and my motherland’ I chose my mother because at the end of 41 years, France has succeeded in making me … a Stranger.”   In lead-up to the 2014 election, Nekkaz faced defeat once again when the Constitutional Council rejected his candidacy. He claims to have collected 62,000 signatures but they were stolen from within the Council. This 2019 bid for president with his cousin as proxy, unusual as it may appear, falls in a line with the actions of a man seemingly willing to do anything to achieve his goal of holding public office. All of this comes amidst the country-wide protests which have broken out in opposition to sitting president Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term.

Rabat – A center for medical imaging and oncology will open in Oujda, northeast Morocco, announced Oncology &amp; Diagnosis of Morocco (ODM), Morocco’s leading healthcare platform offering oncology and diagnostics services, on Wednesday. The clinic, called Oriental Al Kindy, will offer quality healthcare and some of the most advanced technologies to treat cancer. Established by local and foreign experts, the clinic has been under construction for 2 years and cost MAD 100 million. The 4,100-meter-square facility has five floors and can host 6,000 patients a year. It consists of six medical units, consultation rooms, a chemotherapy room, radiotherapy and radiophysics unit, a High Dose Rate Brachytherapy unit, and a digital mammography unit, according to ODM. The clinic is also equipped with two ultrasound scanners.  Late in January, Morocco opened a low-cost anti-cancer industrial complex in Bouskoura, near Casablanca, the first of its kind in Africa. The medical complex, established by the Moroccan pharmaceutical company,Sothema manufactures serum and makes cancer-fighting biotechnological medicine available at low prices. The medical complex seeks to provide high-quality early cancer treatment to Moroccan citizens at affordable prices, reduce cancer mortality, and improve the country’s healthcare sector. The cancer mortality rate has increased in Morocco in the past few years, especially that of cervical cancer. A new interactive map by the MENA Coalition for HPV Elimination and the Tunisian Center for Public Health, shared with MWN, shows that cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among Moroccan women. In 2018, about 2,465 women died of cervical cancer of the 13.2 million women in Morocco. The number of deaths caused by cervical cancer per year nearly doubled in the country between 2012 and 2018, increasing from 1,076 to 2,465, according to the coalition.

Rabat – Three veteran Moroccan political figures have asked for King Mohammed VI to pardon Taoufik Bouachrine, a Moroccan journalist convicted of rape and sexual assault in the workplace. Mohamed Bensaid Ait Idder, known as the “elder” of the Moroccan Left, and Moulay Ismail Alaoui and Moulay M’hamed Khalifa, both members of the political bureau of the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, have appealed to royal sympathy for Bouachrine. In a letter to King Mohammed VI, the three politicians pleaded for a royal pardon for Bouachrine. Bouachrine, who was arrested in February 2018, received a 12-year prison sentence in November after a Casablanca court convicted him of violence, rape, human trafficking, and influence peddling. Bouachrine is the director of one of Morocco’s leading newspapers, Akhbar Al Yaoum, and its online outlet Alyaoum24. He was arrested after several female journalists who worked at his paper filed complaints of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. The journalist’s trial was mired in controversies. His supporters pointed to the “instrumentalization of justice,” claiming that the allegations were politically motivated. They argued Bouachrine was a victim his “critical and high-standard” journalism. Others, including a number of his victims, welcomed the court’s verdict. Victims said the journalist’s trial was fair. Most recently, the UN joined the list of critics of Moroccan authorities on the Bouachrine affair. The rights group said that the journalist’s trial probably had political motivations. The organization said the trial was not fair and was beset with irregularities. Morocco quickly responded to the UN’s claims. The government said it was “surprised” by the organization’s report, which it described as “biased” and “unfounded.”

Rabat – Early Wednesday at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), over 2,000 airport employees gathered to strike, halting all airport operations. At midnight, staff from all parts of the airport, including security officers, cabin crew, customer service, and grounds operation staff stopped working.  The employees are striking against a new plan in which Kenya Airways, a private airline, would take over the management of airports from the Kenya Airports Authority, a government body. Among their grievances, airport staff complain of poor working conditions, unfair hiring practices, and unacceptable salaries. The employees’ salaries have not been revised for four years.  “JKIA is a public entity owned by the government. We raised the dispute around that because you cannot surrender a national asset, which is managed by Kenya Airports Authority to an airline which is in private hands without any due process,” said one of the organizers of the strike, Moss Ndiea. The strike affected four of Kenya’s main airports, including those in Mombasa, Eldoret, and Kisumu. As a result of the strike, thousands of passengers were left stranded outside of airports. Over 60 flights failed to leave the Nairobi airport, east Africa’s largest. Flights from the Kenyan capital had to be rescheduled for later times.  Condemning the strike, the Kenyan government called it illegal and brought in members of the Kenyan air force to settle the situation. According to local media, riot police were also deployed and responded to the protesters with tear gas and batons. Ten people have been arrested so far, including Kenya Aviation Workers Union Secretary-General Moss Ndiema. “The government and those with vested interest are using the police as an instrument to silence workers. They have resorted to hard tactics to arrest and mishandle innocent workers. We have the right to assembly,” said Ndiea. Kenyans took to Twitter to comment on the situation and provide updates. Privatising a strategic facility like a port or airport is unacceptable….. Preparing to hand it over to a foreign power should be regarded as an act of treason. And for a foreign power to occupy any such facility should be deemed as an act of aggression. #JKIA — Kakamega_pundit🇰🇪 (@Kakamega_pundit) March 6, 2019  Live from #JKIA. It is all but Chaos, local and foreign passengers have been caught in the midst of it. pic.twitter.com/im434qJmp6 — THE JOURNALIST 🇰🇪 (@KiplimoKigen) March 6, 2019  Situation at #JKIA GSU anti-riot disrupts ongoing strike by Kenya Aviation Authority Workers Union Kenya Airways pic.twitter.com/9sjWNeMdQ4 — Eric Kobia (@RoyalRiqs) March 6, 2019  Early in the morning, Kenyan Airways advised passengers on flights which departed later than 11 a.m. not to come to the airport. Further to the strike by KAWU members, we expect disruptions on flights. Customers on flights after 11 A.M are advised not to come to the airport until further communication is shared. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. pic.twitter.com/XqjxrTf2QK — Kenya Airways (@KenyaAirways) March 6, 2019  However, later in the day, with the situation improving, flights to Amsterdam and Mumbai were able to take off. Domestic flights are also expected to resume shortly.  Last year, Morocco experienced a similar strike, which significantly impacted travel plans. Between June 20 and August 14, pilots of Royal Air Maroc protested their wages and working conditions. During the strike, over 200 flights were canceled.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for Orphans (AMO) has introduced a national plan to have “a Morocco without abandoned children” by 2030, urging the government to support single mothers to discourage them from abandoning their children. During its second National Forum on Orphans from February 9-10 in Casablanca—themed “The abandonment of children in Morocco, a tragic reality”—AMO stressed that abandoned children in Morocco are living a bitter reality and “real tragedy,” even in centers and orphanages.  AMO’s plan seeks alternative solutions to the children’s plight, proposing to the Moroccan government and all legal entities concerned with family and children’s rights in the country to provide support for single mothers who abandon their children because of social and economic difficulties. The association calls for the government to provide unwed mothers with legal protection, impose DNA tests to identify the children’s fathers so they can also take responsibility, and remove penalties against unwed mothers. Giving birth out of wedlock is illegal in Morocco. Article 446 of the Moroccan Penal Code stipulates that a person, if convicted of having sex outside of marriage, can be sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. The association is also calling on the Ministry of Justice to review its strict adoption policies, facilitate the adoption of abandoned children, and to monitor and implement programs to prepare families wishing to adopt a child before allowing the final process of adoption. AMO said that such measures should be taken into account to ensure that children are not abandoned again. AMO pointed out that abandoned or orphaned children in Morocco live through harsh conditions in addition to lack of parental love and affection which leaves a negative impact on their psychological health. The organization added that many find themselves unable to succeed in school or in their careers. “Our goal is to break the taboos about the problem of orphaned children in Morocco, and facilitate their integration in family life, schooling, training, and professional life,” said AMO President Yassine Rafya Benchekroun. According to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning, there are an estimated 30,000 orphans in Morocco.  Abandoned children are often cared for in institutions and child welfare centers across the country.  While some are lucky enough to be adopted, others continue to wait for their biological parents to come back for them for years until they grow up and leave the centers to face new hardships in society.

Rabat – The Global Firepower Index (GFP) has ranked Morocco’s military power 60th globally according to their GFP value of 0.8244. A value of 0.0000 is a perfect value. According to their aircraft strength, Morocco is ranked 35th out of the 137 nations represented. GFP uses data analysis to rank the top 137 modern military powers. The ranking compares the potential war-making capability of nations based on over 50 factors, such as a nation’s resources, manpower, finances, geography, and air, land, and naval strength. The United States ranked first, followed by Russia (second), China (third), India (fourth), France (fifth), and Japan (sixth). Among Morocco’s neighbors, Egypt was ranked 12th, Spain 21st, and Algeria 27th. The analysis reported Morocco possesses 1,109 combat tanks, 2,270 armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and 800 artilleries of three different types: 530 self-propelled artilleries, 198 towed artilleries, and 72 rocket projectors. Spain has only 327 combat tanks, 2,040 AFVs, and 240 artilleries. In turn, Algeria possesses 2,475 combat tanks, 6,900 AFVs, and 1,350 artilleries. In Africa, Morocco is ranked seventh for its war making capabilities, while Egypt is ranked first and Algeria second. Algeria’s higher ranking than Morocco is in part due to its higher defense budget, lower external debt, higher foreign reserve, and proven oil reserves. While Morocco’s defense budget is $3.4 billion, Algeria’s budget is $10.6 billion. Additionally, Morocco’s external debt is $51.5 billion, while Algeria’s debt is only $6.3 billion. However, Morocco does possess greater navel assets than Algeria as well as a greater number of  military personnel. Morocco has 346,000 military personnel, while Algeria has 280,000. In 2017, Morocco was ranked 57th and in 2018, Morocco was ranked 55th. However, this year, Morocco’s military strength ranking dropped to 60th, demonstrating a fall in military strength compared to other nations. In January, Morocco’s House of Councillors in Parliament passed Law 44.18 on mandatory military service. Moroccan men and women between the ages of 19 and 25 will now be subject to a 12-month military service, beginning in September.

Rabat – A report from the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) shows that hashish is the most common drug police seize in Africa.  The 2018 report, published yesterday, shows that Morocco is where the largest quantities of cannabis were seized in 2017: 117 tons of cannabis resin and 283 tons of  cannabis. Algeria  seized the third highest quantity of cannabis in Africa, at 52 tons. According to the report, “Africa remains an important transit region for drug trafficking as well as a growing destination for drug trafficking.” In January, the Moroccan National Narcotics Commission (CNS) said that there are between 47,000 and 50,000 hectares of cannabis grown in Morocco, especially in the Rif region. INCB’s report stipulates that most African production of cannabis happens in Morocco. “[Cannabis] resin trafficking follows a route that goes through North Africa and Spain to reach the rest of Europe.” Cannabis is also the most used drug in Europe, accounting for 38 percent of the EU’s illicit drug retail market, according to the report. “Cannabis resin is mainly trafficked from Morocco, but it is increasingly produced in Europe it self,” the report found. Cocaine and cannabis are among the most popular drugs trafficked in the continent. The INCB recalled Moroccan security service operations against international drug trafficking. One of the operations mentioned in the report was the seizure of 541 kilograms of cocaine in February 2018 in Casablanca. The report mentioned a similar operation in Algeria in May 2018. The INCB noted that heroin trafficking is not widespread in Africa to the extent of other drugs. Sharing statistics from 2017, the report said that only a few African countries reported seizures of heroin. Moroccan security services seized 11.47 kilograms of heroin, while Nigeria seized 112.6 kilograms. Psychotropic tablets are also among the drugs circulating in Morocco, including opioid painkiller Tramadol. The report indicates that Spain is the main entry point for Moroccan cannabis. Morocco’s law enforcement continue to crack down on drug trafficking networks.  Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in 2018 that Morocco prosecuted 107,000 people in 2017 in drug cases. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) reported that Moroccan security services seized 693 kilograms of cannabis, 52 tons of cannabis resin and 1.3 million of psychotropic and ecstasy pills in 2018.

By Katya Schwenk Rabat – Jazzablanca Festival is seeking applications from Moroccan artists to perform, organizers said Wednesday. The annual festival showcases jazz and jazz fusion, attracting musicians from around the globe to Morocco. Last year, crowds totaling 75,000 gathered for a week of festivities in Casablanca, attending concerts in the city’s streets, theaters, and at more intimate venues. Jazzablanca will take place this year July 2-7. The festival spotlights both traditional jazz performance and artists who are modernizing the genre, per their website. They hope to draw attention to innovation in jazz—and to the local jazz scene in Morocco.  This is the fourth year the festival has reserved spots for Moroccan performers. The selected musicians will perform on an official stage at the festival—either the Casa-Anfa racecourse or the BMCI Stage at the United Nations Square. Last year, Moroccan singer Sonia Noor performed as did the Moroccan trio Barons of Baltimore, who blend poetry with electronic music and jazz. Organizers have not yet released the program for 2019’s festival, but high-profile stars topped last year’s lineup, including British singer Tom Odell and the eclectic musical collective Postmodern Jukebox.  The 2018 program featured 50 concerts, with sounds ranging from Saharan blues to contemporary Spanish jazz.  Performers have until April 15 to submit their applications. All Moroccan nationals and Moroccan residents are eligible.

Rabat – The Moroccan Innov Invest Fund (FII) financed 68 startups in Morocco between October 2017 and March 2019, according to a press release issued by the Central Guarantee Fund (CCG) which manages the fund.

The FII approved ten new incubator companies last Friday. These include Menara Cluster, Enactus, Endeavor, Bidaya, Happy Ventures, H Seven, CFCIM Kluster, Moroccan CISE, CE3M, and CEED Morocco.

The majority of these technology companies, 62, received pre-seed and seed investment, from Innov Idea and Innov Start, respectively, worth MAD 12.3 million. FII gave the remaining MAD 34 million of the total funding it was granted as venture capital to another six startups.

The projects Innov Invest funded are focused on the information technology, agriculture, and manufacturing industries.

Launched in October 2017 with a budget of MAD 500 million, FII is still far from its initial goal. The fund must finance at least 300 innovative projects by 2022.

In Morocco, technology companies are making progress in raising funds. In 2018, 366 startups in Morocco and the rest of the MENA region had raised $893 million in financing, according to the startup directory Magnitt.

The Moroccan government set up the FII financing system for start-ups and innovative companies in October 2017.

Under the system, the CCG is tasked with developing partnerships with “business angels.”

Rabat – The European commissioner for migration, home affairs, and citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, has tweeted his gratitude for Morocco’s efforts on migration. “I would like to commend Morocco for its actions,” the official said. Avramopoulos thanked Morocco and emphasized the EU’s will to reinforce its partnerships with Morocco. Avramopoulos also reassured Morocco of the EU’s support. In recent months, Morocco and Spain complained of pressure because of the flow of undocumented migrants from Morocco to Spain at the border. I would like to commend Morocco for its actions and assure it of our support. We look forward to developing a closer, deeper and more ambitious partnership with Morocco. #MigrationEU 🇪🇺 🇲🇦 pic.twitter.com/F5Yce5RykH — DimitrisAvramopoulos (@Avramopoulos) March 6, 2019  Both countries asked the EU to provide Morocco additional financial support to control the border. In December, the EU Commission published a statement announcing that it would give Morocco €148 million to use for migration control. “The EU is intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route,” read the statement. In December, Avramopoulos emphasized the increasing pressure facing Morocco as more migrants are using to the western Mediterranean route to reach Europe. The official also talked about the EU-Morocco cooperation to improve living conditions for migrants to reduce the number of irregular migration attempts. In his tweet, the EU official expressed satisfaction with the EU-Morocco partnership. “We look forward to developing a closer, deeper and more ambitious partnership with Morocco,” he said.

Rabat – The US and the EU have called on Algerian authorities to respect citizens’ rights to peacefully protest against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika‘s re-election. On Tuesday, in Washington, D.C., the US State Department’s deputy spokesperson, Robert Palladino, told journalists, “The United States supports the Algerian people and their right to peacefully assemble.”  “We’re monitoring these protests that are happening in Algeria and we’re going to continue to do that,” added Palladino. In Brussels, the spokeswoman for the European Commission, Maja Kocijancic, has called on Algerian authorities to respect “freedom of expression and assembly.” “When we talk about demonstrations, the rights to freedom of expression and assembly are enshrined in the Algerian Constitution,” said Kocijancic. “We are expecting for these rights to be exercised peacefully and guaranteed in accordance with the rule of law,” she emphasized. Kocijancic stressed Brussels’ commitment “to continue to deepen our relations with the aim of creating a common and shared space of stability, democracy, and prosperity.” Bouteflika’s announcement on February 10 that he would seek re-election for a fifth term has angered Algerians who have taken to the streets to protest Bouteflika’s bid. Algeria will go to the polls April 18. Bouteflika has promised he would not serve a full five-year term but would organize a national conference for early elections if he wins.  Algerian army committed to security  The Algerian army’s top officer, General Gaid Salah, stated on Tuesday that the army will remain “the guarantor” of stability and security against those “who want to take [Algeria] back” to the years of civil war. Algeria experienced a brutal civil war in the 1990s between the government and armed Islamic groups. The war eased following the 1999 election of Bouteflika, who introduced an amnesty law. Approximately 200,000 people died in the civil war, including journalists, citizens, and soldiers. By 2002, Algeria had tracked down all the armed Islamists, although some had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda and fled the country. In a visit to the military academy in Chercheil, 80 kilometers from Algiers, Salah noted that Algeria has made important steps to eradicate terrorist cells and “abolished their goals.” He said some parties were displeased to see Algeria “stable and certain.” Salah, who is close to Bouteflika, has promised the Algerian people that they will always enjoy security and stability, calling them to “know how to erect a rampart against anything that could expose Algeria to unpredictable threats.”

Rabat – An attacker bombed an Amsterdam cafe belonging to a Moroccan resident in the Netherlands on Sunday.

According to the Dutch AT5 television channel, the incident is a part of a “settling of accounts” between drug traffickers of Moroccan origin. The same cafe, named Smoke Palace, was the target of an explosion on the night of January 12. 

The owner, Mohamed El Y., does not have a criminal record, but his younger brother, Mustapha, is said to have been on the hit list of one or more gangs involved in the drug trade, according to the television channel.  Mustapha was reportedly warned several times that his life was under threat from competitors. The attacker used a heavy explosive in the bomb. According to the Dutch newspaper Het Parool, a car drove away after the bomb went off, but the driver was not identified. The police hope that CCTV footage will help identify the perpetrator. In addition to the cafe, which took thousands of euros worth of damage, the bomb damaged two neighboring buildings considerably. Mayor Femke Halsema will decide this week whether to reopen the cafe or to close it permanently. Mohamed and Mustapha were born in Morocco, but have lived and worked in Amsterdam for a long time. In Morocco, drug-related crimes have been on the increase in the last decade. Drug crimes went up from 37,985 cases in 2012 to 85,000 cases in 2017.  In 2018, with enhanced criminal investigations techniques, police seized over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills, up 43 percent over 2017.

Rabat – Polisario’s claims suffered another blow in recent weeks as Moroccan representatives at the African Union Parliament urged fellow delegates to respect their recent commitments. At a debate on African migration yesterday in Johannesburg, Morocco’s delegates at the pan-African Parliament “thwarted attempts from some circles to use the event to put forth pro-Polisario claims,” MAP reported today. Preventing Polisario supporters from shifting focus from the stated agenda of the parliamentary meeting, Moroccan delegates pointed to the North African country’s contributions to a number of continental agendas. Since its readmission to the African Union in January 2017, they argued according to MAP, Morocco has pioneered on numerous continental fronts, including security, migration, and agriculture. Rabat has consistently showed its genuine willingness to act for the good of Africa, they suggested. More importantly, though, Morocco’s MPs brought up the country’s investment efforts in Western Sahara, arguing that the southern provinces have experienced remarkable transformations in recent years. In the past 5-6 years, the bulk of Morocco’s investment in development projects has gone to Dakhla and Laayoune in Western Sahara. In addition, Morocco’s representatives urged their fellow African delegates to show commitment to recent AU statements by refraining from discussing the Western Sahara territorial dispute. The urge was meant to remind the meeting that the African Union has already decided to leave the resolution of the Sahara conflict to the exclusive authority of the UN Security Council. According to MAP, however, the most compelling episode in Morocco’s rebuttal of Polisario’s separatist claims was delivered when Yehfadeh Ben Mbarek, a local Sahrawi representative who was part of the Moroccan delegation, said that he and many Sahrawis are “proud of [their] Moroccanness.” “I was born and educated in Dakhla, one of the cities of the Moroccan Sahara, and where I democratically engage in politics,” Mbarek said, alluding to the fact that Western Sahara takes part in Moroccan general elections. In the latest Moroccan elections, the southern provinces had the highest participation rate. He added, in an even more heartfelt plea, that he is “one example of Moroccan Sahrawis, proud of my Moroccanness and fully enjoying my economic, political, and economic rights.” The audience greeted Mbarek’s final remarks with a thunderous ovation, according to MAP. The news comes as Morocco continues to solidify its growing influence on African affairs. At the 28th AU summit last month in Addis Ababa, African leaders applauded Morocco’s efforts on migration. Meanwhile, Rabat’s assertive presence in the banking and investment sectors has helped cement relations with a number of countries, especially in Francophone sub-Saharan Africa. There are also growing signs of overtures with important non-Francophone continental players like Nigeria and Ethiopia. Of Morocco’s sustained efforts to establish itself as a continental hub in a wide range of sectors, the Financial Times recently wrote, “While Morocco’s new African strategy has been most evident in commercial deals, it also points towards the emergence of a genuinely post-colonial African order.”

Rabat – Several Sahrawi MPs are conducting a sit-in today in front of Polisario’s secretariat to protest widespread corruption in Tindouf camps. The MPs informed Polisario’s “Interior Ministry” and secretariat of their protest in Rabouni, according to the separatist news outlet Futurosahara. MPs also called on Sahrawis to attend the sit-in en masse to learn about what is happening in the Polisario Parliament behind the scenes. In a public statement, the MPs said they are protesting the wasting of public money, abuse of authority for personal purposes, absence of accountability, and the prevalence of all kinds of corruption. The protest follows a Polisario corruption scandal.  in February, La Provincia reported that the Polisario Front misappropriated €2.5 million worth of humanitarian aid given to Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps from the international community. Algeria, an ally of the Polisario Front ally, is also under pressure from protests over the re-election campaign of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In his 2018 report on Western Sahara, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the situation in the Tindouf camps. Guterres wrote about “the lack of progress in the political process,” as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid.” In the sixth section of the report, the UN chief warned that “malnutrition and anemia prevalence remained public health concerns.”

Rabat – Reports that several women in Morocco have been attacked with acid are false, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) stated in a press release.

In a broadly shared audio on the WhatsApp messaging app, a woman claimed that “six cases of acid throwing against women were reported in one day. They were victims of offenders posing as beggars on the roads.”

The DGSN opened an investigation into the allegations to counteract any negative impact on the population’s sense of security, particularly among women.

The DGSN found no complaints of acid attacks as described in the audio recording.

Police consulted the radio station that was said to be the source of the audio, but the station denied that it had ever published any audio material or information of the kind. The investigation is ongoing. According to Acid Survivors Trust International, 1,500 recorded attacks occur every year, and over half of acid attacks go unreported each year. Women account for 80 percent of the victims of acid attacks. Acid attacks are more common in South Asia.

Rabat – On Tuesday, bishops in Morocco met for a press conference in Casablanca  to discuss the schedule of Pope Francis’s visit. The pope will arrive in Morocco on March 30 for a two-day visit. Archbishop Cristobal Lopez Romero of Rabat said the pope is visiting Morocco for two reasons: To accept King Mohammed VI’s invitation request for a state visit and to respond to the invitation of Catholics in Morocco. Along with Romero, Archbishop Santiago Agrelo Martinez of Tangier and Father Daniel Nourrissat spoke at the press conference. The first stop for Pope Francis will be a meeting with King Mohammed VI on Saturday, March 30 at 2:30 at the Royal Palace of Rabat for an official reception ceremony. Pope Francis and the King will also visit Hassan Tower in Rabat. Both the King and the “servant of hope” will deliver a speech. The pope will also visit the mausoleum of King Mohammed V. Later, the pope will visit the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, where he will meet Islamic counsellors and imams. Morocco’s Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufiq will give a speech, which will be followed by statements from European and African students at the center. Students will then sing Muslim, Christian, and Jewish songs. The Pope will then head to the headquarters of Caritas, an international confederation of Catholic charitable organizations. At 8 p.m. the Royal Palace will host a dinner with the Vatican delegation. Sunday, March 31 will start with a visit from Pope Francis to the Rural Social Service of Temara run by the Daughters of Charity. Pope Francis will also visit Saint Peter’s Cathedral in Rabat to meet with priests and other Christian leaders. The pope will also hold a solemn papal mass in the Prince Moulay Abdallah Sports Complex. The pope will then head to the airport to leave Morocco for the Vatican. Lat month, Vatican News estimated the number of Catholics in Morocco at 50,000, who are mostly European expatriates. In 1985, late monarch Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II, the first pope to visit Morocco,  as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians.

Rabat – The Tunisian terrorist who attacked Berlin’s Breitscheidplatz Christmas market on December 19, 2016, was known to Moroccan intelligence services because he reportedly had ties with radical Moroccan Islamists in Germany, according to the German news agency DPA. DPA said it obtained information from documents of the security services.  The German Federal Bureau of Investigation (BKA) provided the documents to the German authorities in November 2016.  The attacker, Anis Amri, drove a hijacked truck into the crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring more than 70. The news agency learned from a briefing note that Moroccan intelligence services requested further information regarding a Moroccan, a French-Moroccan, and Amir. According to German police, Anis Amri, who was a failed asylum seeker, was not a lone wolf and may have had links to a terrorist network. Italian police shot Amri dead after a gunfight in which Amri shot a policeman in the shoulder while trying to escape. Moroccan intelligence services had informed Germany of the possibility of an attack.

Rabat – Disagreements between Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) have grown to such an extent that the royal court is allegedly taking measures to curb the crown prince’s increasing authority. The Guardian reported yesterday that rumors of growing tensions between the King and the crown prince have been the most debated subject in Saudi royal circles in recent days. According to the article, the King is significantly upset by a number of moves from MBS, both at the domestic and diplomatic levels. “There are growing signs of a potentially destabilizing rift between the king of Saudi Arabia and his heir,” the newspaper reported. Tensions between the two reportedly date back to the global backlash that followed news of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was killed in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi was trenchantly critical of the crown prince’s high-handed rule, and US intelligence agencies have concluded that MBS was involved in the journalist’s murder. According to the British news outlet, however, the Khashoggi affair was one among many reasons for the “growing rift” between father and son. Citing a “detailed account from a source,” the Guardian indicated that the divergence between the two reached its most critical point during King Salman’s visit to Egypt late in February. While in Egypt, the King “was warned by his advisors he was at risk of a potential move against him.” So “alarmed” was King Salman’s entourage by MBS’s perceived defiance that a 30-member security team from the interior ministry flew to Egypt to replace the existing security crew believed to be loyal to MBS. “The king’s advisers also dismissed Egyptian security personnel who were guarding him while he was in Egypt,” the article noted. A subsequent incident that may add legitimacy to the reported friction occurred when, upon the King’s return from Egypt, MBS was not among the officials to welcome his father at the airport. “There are subtle but important signs of something amiss in the royal palace,” the Brookings Intelligence Project’s director Bruce Riedel told the British newspaper. Riedel elaborated, “A healthy crown prince is expected to welcome the king home from a foreign trip, it’s a sign of respect and the continuity of government.” But more critical still are suggestions that King Salman was not informed of some recent important decisions made in his absence. The King and his entourage reportedly learned of recent royal appointments, including those of the first Saudi female ambassador to the US and of MBS’s brother Khalid bin Salman to the Ministry of Defense, from TV. Asked about such deviance from traditional protocol of royal appointments, however, a spokesperson from the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., sugarcoated the significance of the moves. He said it was “customary” for the King to delegate his powers to his deputy. The spokesperson also dismissed as “baseless” suggestions that MBS was challenging the King’s authority. MBS has faced sustained global outcry since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Four months after the incident, Muslims around the world protested en masse against MBS’s presence at the Mecca Grand Mosque, Islam’s holiest site. Scores of Muslims vented their anger on social media platforms, mostly saying that it was inconceivable that a “murderer” could set foot on the holy site. King Salman has also reportedly not been happy with MBS’s handling of the Khashoggi affair. He has been allegedly trying to mitigate the damage that MBS’ miscalculated moves have cost the kingdom’s reputation on the world stage. The father-son rift also involves MBS’s stance on foreign policy issues such as Jerusalem and President Trump’s “deal of the century” for Palestine. The crown prince is believed to favor Trump’s plan for Palestinians, whereas King Salman is known to maintain the traditional Arab stance on the Palestinian case: He supports the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Rabat – New conditions have emerged regarding Morocco’s friendly football match with Argentina on March 26 in Tangier. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) will send a private jet to transport the Argentine football team from Spain, reported Moroccan newspaper Al Akhbar. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) also insisted that the Atlas Lions must not be ruthless in taking the ball from Lionel Messi. FRMF will allegedly pay MAD 10 million to the Argentine governing body for Messi to play in Morocco. The FRMF has stipulated that Messi must play for fewer than 60 minutes.  AFA instructed that it will be coach Herve Renard’s responsibility to ensure the smooth running of the friendly match. The AFA has banned both Atlas Lions and fans from taking pictures with the Barcelona star and exchanging jerseys with him. Messi will also not give any statements to the press. Messi and his national teammates will stay in an undisclosed hotel in Tangier. Officials are keeping the location secret to avoid the team being bothered by media or fans. It is also expected that a security team will protect the Argentinian players. The match will serve as preparation for the Atlas Lions for the coming Africa Cup of Nations championship in Egypt, planned for June 15 to July 13.

Rabat – The spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, announced on Tuesday that the second roundtable discussion on Western Sahara will take place in the second half of March in Switzerland. The spokesperson, however, did not give any further details about the meeting, which will see the participation of representatives from Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania. “In preparation for the second round table, in February and early March, he has been holding bilateral consultations,” said Dujarric of the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler. Kohler consulted with a Polisario delegation in Berlin this week, including the chairman of the self-styled Sahrawi National Council. According to the “official” news agency of the front, the meeting focused on “launching the direct negotiation process between the parties to the conflict.” Polisario wants self-determination. Morocco, however, has made it clear several times that the only solution to end the conflict is through Morocco’s autonomy plan. In January, Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale said that Morocco is ready to negotiate with the parties but only within the framework of its proposal. “Outside autonomy, nothing, we are not ready to negotiate anything.” Kohler is expected to also meet delegations from Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria prior to the second roundtable. Following the second roundtable, the UN Security Council will hold a series of consultations on MINURSO and the regional conflict April 9-10. The consultations will be followed by a report from the Secretary-General on the conflict as well as the adoption of a new resolution. Kohler announced his plans to convene the parties to the conflict for a second roundtable at the end of the first, which took place December 5-6, 2018, in Geneva. All of the parties involved in the regional conflict attended the meeting, showing commitment to the UN-led political process to end the 44-year old dispute. Kohler reiterated his plan to convene the parties during a consultation meeting on MINURSO with the Security Council on January 29.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – In January, an Israeli minister said Israel will demand compensation from Arab countries for the possessions the Jewish community living in Arab countries left behind after immigrating to Israel in the late 1940s. Commenting on Minister for Social Equality Gila Gamliel’s remarks saying Arab countries should compensate Israel, the president of the Canadian Sephardi Federation, Avraham Elarar, asserted that Moroccan Jews who emigrated were not fleeing the kingdom.  The recompense Israel will demand is estimated at $250 billion from Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, and Iran. The Israeli Ministry of Social Equality intends to file lawsuits against Tunisia for $35 billion and Libya for $15 billion for the lost and abandoned belongings of Jews in Arab countries. “The time has come to correct the historic injustice of the pogroms in seven Arab countries and Iran, and to restore, to hundreds of thousands of Jews who lost their property, what is rightfully theirs,” Gamliel said.  Elarar defended Morocco, referring to a statement from the political secretary of the World Jewish Congress, Alexander L. Easterman, at the Fourth General Assembly of the World Jewish Congress in 1959, who said, “Morocco discouraged its Jewish community from leaving the country.” Elarar disagreed that Jews fleeing Morocco were refugees: “To claim, however, that the Moroccan Jews who [immigrated to Israel] were refugees denigrates them by distorting the historical facts and denies that they were ardent Zionists.” He wrote that Israel has “unjustly accused” Morocco, equating it to other countries, like Egypt, which not only confiscated the property of their Jewish community but also repealed their nationality.  Israel’s demand for compensation is not unprecedented. Israeli columnist Gideon Levy wrote in September 2018 in the Israeli news outlet Haaretz that “while Israel avoids paying any compensation for its systematic destruction and killing in the Palestinian territories since 1948, there are those who still have the unbelievable audacity to demand compensation from the Palestinians.”  In January, more than 80 Moroccan intellectuals, researchers, artists, and actors launched an online petition in disapproval of and outrage over Israel’s “Zionist manoeuvers” and its “distortion of Moroccan history.” They added that this “demand lacks credibility when we recall the history of different stages of Jews immigration.”

Rabat – Thousands of Algerian university students from several campuses across Algiers and other cities took to the streets again yesterday, calling for a general strike if their ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika does not step down. The waves of protests, which started on February 22, are persisting as Algeria’s young people started this week by gathering in central Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and other Algerican cities and towns, shouting anti-Bouteflika slogans and holding flags and banners reading, “Algeria is not a monarchy.”   On Tuesday, the twelfth day in the series of demonstrations, the biggest since the Arab Spring in 2011, young Algerians are responding to Bouteflika’s promises, saying, “No means no.”. Bouteflika released a statement on Sunday, March 3, addressing the protests and offering to step down after a year if he wins re-election for a fifth term in the April 18 election.  Bouteflika’s statement, read out by his new campaign manager Abdelghani Zaalene, entailed: “I have heard the pleas of protesters and especially the thousands of young people who asked about our nation’s future … I am committed to the organization of an early presidential election.” The Algerian people expressed throughout this week’s protests that they could no longer wait for Bouteflika to leave. Abderahman, a 21-year-old student, told international media covering the protests that Bouteflika, who is seeking to prolong his 20 years in power, wants “an extra year.” “We don’t want him to stay even an extra second. He should leave now,” Abderahman said. Bouteflika, who has been in Switzerland since February for routine medical checks, was unable to submit his papers for candidacy in person when they were due March 3. Zaalene submitted the official candidacy papers for Bouteflika. The presidential elections will take place April 18.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – According to the Spanish Publico newspaper, Morocco and Spain have begun to plan the repatriation of Moroccan minor children. Spain presented the initiative, called “Unaccompanied Foreign Minors. Regarding Autonomous Cities,” as a legislative proposal. A Spanish interior ministry spokesman said in October that the government of Ceuta intends to solve the problem of unaccompanied foreign minor migrants, in particular Moroccan minors, both in Ceuta and throughout Spain. Last September, Spain’s secretary of state for migration, Consuelo Rumi, held a bilateral meeting with Morocco in Essaouira to discuss the issue. Spanish President Pedro Sanchez announced last November that the EU trust fund for Africa will give Morocco approximately $157 million in exchange for strict control over migration. The Spanish interior ministry said 17 percent of new arrivals  who reached Spain by sea irregularly from January to June of 2018 were Moroccans. Moroccan immigrants represent the biggest percentage of irregular migrants with 5,391 migrants. Of unaccompanied minors reaching Spain, 70 percent were Moroccan. The way unaccompanied minors are cared for in Spain has been criticized. In Melilla, the minors are reportedly sleeping in the streets or in caves waiting for a boat that could take them to Europe. As for Ceuta, local government spokesman Jacob Hachuel argued that minors are “better off in their family setting.” In a publication titled “New face of Migration, Unaccompanied Minors,” a study called for action against the mistreatment minors endure in their quest to reach Europe. UNICEF encouraged Morocco to “find solutions that promote the return of migrant children to their families or to communities willing to take care of them.”

Rabat – The adoption of the fisheries deal from the EU Council of Ministers has angered the Green political group in the European Parliament which is seeking to treat Western Sahara separately from Morocco in the EU’s neighborhood policy (ENP). Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that political group presented the anti-Moroccan amendment on Monday. Parliamentary sources said that the European Parliament’s foreign affairs committee rejected by a large majority the amendment to the text of the Neighborhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument. The committee decides on substantive issues regarding the EU’s international relations. The parliamentary source said that the amendment, which is hostile to Morocco ,reflects the “umpteenth attempt by the enemies of Morocco’s territorial integrity that was nipped in the bud,” given to Morocco’s mobilization to defend its territory. The amendment was also rejected thanks to the “high sense of responsibility of European MPs who remain strongly committed to partnership” with Morocco. Launched in 2004, the ENP helped to promote the EU-Morocco  partnership, according to the European Commission. “Morocco gradually became a privileged partner of the EU in the field of political and economic cooperation as well as trade and technical development cooperation.” In addition to ENP, the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) is one of the pillars that strengthens the partnership between both sides as it has supported cooperation with Morocco for 2014-2020. Morocco and the EU are determined to boost their partnership in several fields, including agriculture, fisheries, and vocational training. In July 2018, the European Parliament rejected an amendment seeking to end the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement.

Rabat- Danish researchers have again confirmed that there is no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism, among a rising anti-vaccination movement and global measles outbreaks. In 1998, English gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published a study linking vaccines and autism. He studied just 12 children before reaching his conclusion. The paper has since been found to be fraudulent and he was disbarred from practicing medicine, but the damage of the paper was done. In recent years, the anti-vaccination movement has become more and more mainstream globally, with many citing the supposed risk of autism as a reason for not vaccinating their children. The Danish study, published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal, tracked all children born in Denmark to Danish mothers from 1999-2010, a group of well over 650,000 children. The study concluded that the MMR vaccine does not increase the risk of autism, even in the most high-risk children. Experts hope that the study will help quash the anti-vaccination movement, which has damaged global health. The World Health Organization listed “vaccine hesitancy” in its top 10 threats to global health for 2019, noting that some countries which had almost eradicated measles have seen a resurgence. The UN reported that measles cases worldwide had soared nearly 50 percent in 2018, killing around 136,000 people.  Fortunately, the anti-vaccine movement did not take off in Morocco. The Moroccan Minister of Health Anas Doukkali announced in February 2018 that Morocco had achieved 95 percent vaccine coverage, while the global average was 87 percent.  In 1987, the government implemented the national immunization program, which is to thank for huge progress in the health sector and led to the eradication of major communicable diseases, including polio, malaria, trachoma, and schistosomiasis in Morocco.

By Ayoub Derraza Rabat – Casablanca’s Raja Athletic Club of Football (RCA) has threatened to withdraw from competitions in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to protest what it calls arbitration mistakes in a match it played against Renaissance Sportive de Berkane (RSB), a club from northeast Morocco. RCA described referee Antoine Effa Essouma’s judgments as a “massacre” and called for an investigation. RCA tied with RSB (0-0) in the group stage of the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup, on Sunday. In a statement published on its website, RCA stressed that it “has the right to consider the possibility of withdrawing from African competitions in the light of the results of the investigation.” Raja’s executive board held an emergency meeting and sent a letter of protest to CAF President Ahmad Ahmad. RCA added that it would also send a complaint to the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa. The club’s executive board also commended the professionalism of its players and technical staff, saying they acted responsibly and with discipline, despite unfairness.  Raja complained that the referee refused a goal at the 92nd minute of the game did not give Raja penalty kicks on multiple occasions, and did not give RSB warning cards. After Sunday’s match, RSB became the leader of Group A in the CAF Cup with 8 points. In the last four games in the Group A, Raja, the CAF title defender, has failed to win and remains in last place with 3 points from three draws and a defeat. Raja still has one away match against Hassania Agadir which will decide whether RCA qualifies to the next round.

Rabat – The US Department of Homeland Security has issued statistics on nationals who received lawful permanent resident status in the US in the first three quarters of 2018. The department granted 2,223 Moroccans lawful permanent resident status during the first nine months of 2018. The data includes Moroccans newly arrived to the US and 720 Moroccans already in the US whose status was adjusted. According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, adjustment of status occurs after candidates apply for lawful permanent resident status or a green card. Moroccans were among the Arab nationals to obtain the most permanent residences. A total of 1,466 Algerians also obtained permanent residence. More Syrian nationals received permanent residence than any other Arab nationality at 10,931. Egypt was the second most represented at 6,999 nationals.  The department also granted permanent residence to 3,916 Jordanians, 1,895 Lebanese, 1,454 Saudis, 762 Kuwaitis, 393 Libyans, 379 Tunisians, 161 Mauritanians, and 109 Bahrainians In terms of newly arrived people, the statistics show that 1,503 newly arrived Moroccans also obtained permanent residence. In the same period, the data shows that 1,818 Moroccans became US citizens by naturalization during the same period.  The US also admitted 14,540 non-migration Moroccan visitors during the first two quarters of 2018. In October, the US Department of State announced the opening of the registration period for the diversity visa lottery for the year 2020. Thousands of Moroccans register for the diversity visa annually to secure one of the 50,000 immigrant visas granted each year to foreign citizens. Despite the high number of Moroccans that apply yearly for the visa, only 900- 1,000 of those selected receive permanent residence visas.

Rabat – The evacuation of 3,000 people from the last ISIS stronghold in Baghouz, a village in eastern Syria, has sparked a humanitarian crisis as Kurdish camps struggle to make room for the displaced. The outpouring of people on Monday follows a standoff between US-backed forces and the remaining ISIS fighters over the weekend, with a torrent of airstrikes and artillery attacks.  Kurdish forces slowed down their attack on Baghouz Sunday night, concerned for the civilians that remain in the area that were being used as “human shields” according to a tweet from Mustapha Bali, the head of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) press office. An SDF official told AFP that “hundreds of ISIS fighters” were among the thousands that “surrendered.” The latest evacuees also include relatives of jihadists, as well as ISIS-held civilians, he added. The evacuation of people from Baghouz is expected to continue. The surge of evacuees poses a challenge to the Kurdish camps, which are already under strain. According to the UN humanitarian coordination office (OHCA), over 15,000 people have arrived at the Al-Hol camp from Baghouz between February 22 and March 1. This pushes the population of the camp to 56,000. The OHCA added that the current influx is “exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.” After months of sustained poor conditions in Baghouz, constant bombardment, and lack of food, families that arrive from Baghouz are often in bad physical or psychological condition.  According to the OCHA, around 90 people, mostly children under the age of five, have died en route to the shelter or shortly after arriving. The fall of Baghouz, the last ISIS stronghold, will be a historical moment in the devastating 8-year Syrian conflict that has killed 360,000 people and made millions of others refugees.  Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) has estimated that 1,668 Moroccans joined ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. The BCIJ has dismantled 59 terror cells, 51 of which had ties to ISIS, since its creation in 2015, according to the head of the office, Abdelhak El Khiame. In December 2018, the BCIJ arrested at least 22 men in connection to the brutal murders of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains. The men who committed the attack filmed themselves saying, “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” referring to another ISIS-held small town in eastern Syria, as they slit the throats of the two women.

By Sydney McCourt Rabat – Egyptian authorities released award-winning Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, better known as Shawkan, from prison on Monday, March 4, after more than five years behind bars. Security forces arrested Shawkan in August 2013 while he was taking photos of demonstrations in Cairo’s Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square.    Shawkan announced his release by posting a picture on Twitter accompanied by the caption “hello asphalt,” a phrase commonly used by freed Egyptian political prisoners. In the tweet, he also used the hashtag #Shawkan_Is_Free.  The hashtag #FreeShawkan united the international campaign for Shawkan’s release and helped garner support for his cause from a number of major human rights organizations. Amnesty International condemned his imprisonment, saying he was arrested simply for doing his job. In honor of World Press Freedom Day in 2015, Shawkan wrote an open letter for Deutsche Welle News in which he described the conditions of his imprisonment and called for international support. The letter ends with Shawkan’s desperate plea: “I am a journalist not a criminal…Help Me!!” Despite the transformation of the hashtag from #FreeShawkan to #Shawkan_Is_Free, his freedom is not unconditional. Shawkan’s release is constricted by the terms of probation, which require him to spend 12 out of every 24 hours at the police station for the next five years. The head of Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) Middle East desk, Sophie Anmuth, has said that the campaign to free Shawkan cannot be considered finished until Shawkan has “recovered his complete freedom, not just 12 hours a day.” Shawkan’s Arrest  Egyptian police arrested Shawkan on August 14, 2013, while he was covering clashes between Egyptian security forces and supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo. The clashes resulted in the deaths of more than 800 people at the hands of the security forces as well as the arrest of thousands, including Shawkan.     The police held Shawkan at Cairo Stadium with journalists Mike Giglio and Louis Jammes, although they released his foreign counterparts after just a few hours. At the time of his arrest, Shawkan was doing freelance work for UK-based journalist site and photo agency Demotix as well as the digital media company Corbis. In 2013 Demotix sent a letter confirming his employment to the Egyptian authorities in an attempt to gain Shawkan’s release, to no avail. Security forces took Shawkan into custody in August 2013, but he did not appear in front of a judge until May 2015 when he faced charges of illegal assembly, weapons possession, murder, and being a member of a terrorist organization. He stood trial in 2018 alongside 739 other defendants, 75 of which received the death penalty. The court sentenced Shawkan to five years, including time served. He spent an additional six months in prison for failing to pay fines for unspecified damages which occurred during the protests.  During his imprisonment, Shawkan received multiple honors for his dedication to journalism from the Committee to Protect Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award (2016) to the UNESCO Press Freedom Award (2018).     International Press Freedom Since being released, Shawkan has told Reuters that he has every intention of continuing his work as a photographer, saying: “All journalists are at risk of being arrested or killed while doing their work. I am not the first and I will not be the last.” The sentiment rings particularly true because there are still more than 30 journalists in jail in Egypt.   RSF ranks Egypt 161st out of 180 countries in terms of freedom of the press, and considers it “one of the largest prisons in the world for journalists.”  While in a better position than Egypt with a ranking of 135st, Morocco, too, faces criticism on press freedom. RSF notes the increase in judicial harassment of journalists in Morocco. In particular, they criticize the obstruction of the press in the events surrounding the Hirak Rif protests. Most famously, the Moroccan press spoke out against the arrest and imprisonment of Hamid El Mehdaoui in connection to the Hirak protests.

By Katya Schwenk Rabat – The group told Reuters on Monday it has plans for two new chemical plants in Nigeria and Ethiopia at a combined investment of $5.2 billion. OCP, Morocco’s leading exporter in phosphate and fertilizers, also plans to build fertilizer-blending facilities in Rwanda, Cote d’Ivoire, and Ghana. Each facility will cost between $8 and $12 million. The announcement comes as part of OCP Group’s push to expand its reach in sub-Saharan Africa. At the end of last year, the company released plans to triple its fertilizer production outside of Morocco, and in January, announced it would build two new fertilizer plants in Nigeria. OCP already maintains 75 percent of the world’s phosphate reserves and holds nearly 50 percent of the world market share of the chemical. OCP’s Africa Fertilizer Complex in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca, produces almost a million tons of fertilizer annually for Africa. But Karim Lotfi Senhaji, chief executive of OCP Africa, told Reuters that OCP hopes to bring production closer to consumers with these new facilities. “We don’t aim to produce everything in Morocco,” he said. The group’s planned facility in Nigeria will produce ammonia, with an expected capacity of 1 million tons. The facility in Ethiopia will have a capacity of 2.5 million tons of fertilizer. The group expects the plants will be operational by 2023 or 2024. OCP also announced yesterday it would sponsor an academic partnership between Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Rabat and two agricultural research institutions in the United Kingdom, Rothamsted Research and Cranfield University. The partnership will aid OCP’s research on fertilizers in Africa. The program will establish a Centre for Doctoral Training in Morocco and support early career researchers in agriculture. Hicham El Habti, secretary general of Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, expressed his support for OCP’s research program on customizable fertilizers. “This vital partnership will support the acceleration of this strategy to help African farmers become not only more productive, but also more prosperous,” El Habti said at the signature ceremony Monday. Phosphates continue to be Morocco’s strongest export, seeing an average annual growth rate of 7.8 percent since 2014. Natural and chemical fertilizers make up the greatest share of this growth, rising from MAD 17.3 billion in 2014 to MAD 29.8 billion last year.

Rabat – Amina Bouayach, the new president of Morocco’s National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), and Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, met on Monday in Geneva to discuss human rights in Morocco. While at the 32nd Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)—running from March 4 to 6— the two officials held talks about Morocco’s efforts and strategies to protect human rights, including those of women, in the country. Bouayach said that she provided the “necessary explanations” about Morocco’s Law 103.13 on the Elimination of Violence Against Women as well as answers to the UN’s inquiries about allegations of “torture” of prisoners in the country. Recently, Amnesty International has condemned “unfair trials and torture” in reports, claiming that Moroccan courts continue to convict activists and journalists and rely heavily on forced confessions. Morocco has strongly rejected the claims and the NGO’s reports, saying that they are “biased” and “void of any credibility” because Amnesty did not provide any evidence for its conclusions. In addition to Monday’s exchange, Morocco’s CNDH council, led by Bouayach, is participating in a GANHRI workshop on Tuesday about peace and conflict in the Middle East, organized by the Arab Network for National Human Rights Institutions. Bouayach will also chair a meeting on migration at the Palace of Nations in Geneva today. King Mohammed VI appointed Bouayach as president of CNDH in December during a royal reception at the Royal Palace in Rabat. According to the latest World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index, Morocco ranks 74th globally and fifth among MENA countries in terms of preservation of order, fundamental law, and absence of corruption for 2019, down from 67th place in the report for 2018. The report measured rule of law based on several criteria such as constraints on government power, absence of corruption, and criminal justice. As for women’s rights in particular, the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2019 report published on February 27 ranked Morocco third of Middle Eastern and North African countries in terms of gender equality in law and business. The report took into account indicators including women’s freedom of movement, laws affecting women’s decisions to enter the labor market, laws affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage gap, and protection from sexual harassment.

Rabat – After Al Aoula channel aired a skit featuring the “Kahlouch” character in early February on Stand Up, a comedy show, the Moroccan High Council of Audiovisual Communication (CSCA) sent a warning to the channel.

The deliberative body of the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication (HACA), chaired by Latifa Akharbach, said, “The SNRT, which operates [Al Aoula], has violated the provisions in force, in particular those relating to human dignity.”

CSCA “considers that the repeated use of the descriptor ‘kahlouch,’ although adopted as a stage name by the candidate himself, constitutes a nickname with a pejorative connotation, referring to his skin color.” The “caricatured accent” of “the character embodied by an immigrant from sub-Saharan Africa” and “the reactions of the jury members and the cheers of the audience on the set, chanting the so-called nickname, go beyond comedy and amount to mockery and contempt,” CSCA added. The content did not comply with the law, reads CSCA’s statement, published on the official gazette.

Before it received the warning, SNRT replied to a letter from HACA about the skit, saying, “The sketch had been the subject of a special evaluation and that it had finally been considered that its content was humorous and self-mocking.”  According to SNRT, the skit did not violate the rules on the freedom of expression. In December, the UN special rapporteur on racism commended Morocco’s policy on migration but urged for action against racism.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The Association for the Taxation of Transactions to Assist Citizens of Morocco (ATTAC-Maroc) is calling for a national strike on March 8, International Women’s Day, to protest sexism and gender-based violence and discrimination against women. ATTAC has invited all associations that fight for women to participate in the strike. The association noted that women participate in all aspects of life. By calling on women to protest, ATTAC says the strike will go further than seeking increases to the minimum wage, but will protest unpaid domestic work, the privatization of education and health, and the decrease of employment opportunities. “If women stop, the world stops” is the message ATTAC wants to send. ATTAC urges women to leave their usual activities, whether  at work or home, and fill the streets for a day of solidarity among women. The Moroccan association is also demanding the government recognize Women’s Day as a public holiday in honor of the sacrifices of women workers. “We, the women of Morocco, like the women of the world, protest on March 8, 2019, to repel all State violations of the social and economic rights of the Moroccan people and to condemn all forms of violence against women” announced ATTAC on Facebook. According to a report issued in 2016 by the National Observatory, 73 percent of Moroccan women experienced physical or mental violence in the public sphere. The number was an increase of 6 percent from a year before.  ATTAC stated that despite the accomplishments of previous laws, they do not affect the essence of the male dominated society that legitimizes the inferiority of women. The refusal to recognize the work of domestic women as a wage is a feature of this exploitation, as all tasks of domestic work continue to consume the vast amount of women’s lives and exhaustion. The Moroccan High Commission for Planning found that 61.8 percent of Moroccan women stay at home. In a statement of solidarity, Belgian women promised to take part in the strike, stating, “This year, we too, women in Belgium, take action.”

Rabat – The French Nexteam Group will start making aluminum and hard metals aeronautical parts at its plant in the city of Mohammedia, near Casablanca. According to a statement from the group issued on March 1, the plant will cover almost 2,500 square meters. The company is also planning to employ about 80 people by 2022. “The new location reflects our desire to always be closer to our customers, some already present in Morocco and to position ourselves as one of the major players in this fast growing sector in the region,” said Nexteam Group President Ludovic Asquini. According to the statement, the production launch is scheduled for May or June 2019. Nexteam’s customers include several companies operating in Morocco, including Safran. Boeing has a joint venture with France’s Safran in Casablanca to build aerospace parts, such as wire bundles and harnesses, for aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. Bombardier, the world’s third largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, also has a presence in Morocco. The aeronautical industry has become a major sector in Morocco. In 2018, Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said that the aeronautical sector “is fast moving forward” in Morocco. The minister added that Morocco exported $1.2 billion worth of aeronautical materials, and aerospace jobs increased by 50 percent in 2017.. Morocco now has 130 aerospace companies. Morocco’s strategic location helps to attract foreign investors because it represents a gateway to both Africa and Europe. In 2016, foreign direct investment website fDi Intelligence ranked Casablanca among the 15 aerospace cities of the future, and 6th in the top 10 aerospace cities “in terms of cost-effectiveness.” Nexteam’s headquarters are based in Marmande, France. According to the statement, it is a major player in the “world of aeronautics and rank 1 supplier of major customers.” The company’s main mission is focused on “the design, manufacture and support of aircraft and helicopter structures and flight equipment.”

Rabat – Former Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn has won a bail appeal and could be released “under caution.” Tokyo District Court ruled to release Ghosn on bail of $9 million on Tuesday, after rejecting Ghosn’s two previous attempts to obtain bail. But hours after the court approved Ghosn’s bail, Japanese prosecutors appealed the ruling and may file additional charges. Ghosn’s head lawyer Junichiro Hironaka had proposed the court release Ghosn on the condition he remains in Japan and is prevented from trying to destroy evidence. Hironaka, nicknamed “the acquitter,” is known for winning high profile cases in Japan, where prosecutors gain convictions in 99 percent of their cases. According to Hironaka, Ghosn’s bail conditions include monitoring by surveillance cameras and restrictions on his use of computers to limit the amount of information he can access or exchange with other people. If found guilty, Ghosn may be sentenced to 15 years in prison. Japan arrested Ghosn, at the time the chairman of both Nissan and Renault, for underreporting his income and transferring personal investment losses to Nissan. He has repeatedly denied all the allegations, arguing that he is the victim of a plot. Ghosn claims that Nissan executives, who were against his plan to have Renault own a majority of Nissan, were plotting against him.  According to reports, Renault owns more than 40 percent of Nissan, while Nissan holds only a 15 percent stake in the French carmaker.  Japan also arrested former Nissan executive director Greg Kelly on charges that Kelly helped Ghosn under-report his income. Kelly denied the allegations and was set free on bail on December 25.

Rabat – Morocco has issued an indirect warning against Iran’s foreign policy at the 36th Arab Interior Ministers Council in Tunis.

Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, the head of the Moroccan delegation, said on Sunday that Iranian “manoeuvers are fuelling ethnic rivalries and internal conflicts to destabilize Arab countries, in a bid to promote its ideology.”  The Moroccan minister added that “these threats are not just limited to a single Arab country, but extend to the entire Arab nation … to sow discord.”

Laftit also said that Morocco has been a target of “these abject manoeuvers threatening national security and terrorizing Moroccan citizens by supporting the separatists and the opponents of Morocco’s territorial integrity.”

Laftit did not explicitly mention Iran in his speech. Laftit’s comments add to a series moves aiming at easing tensions between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, a fierce opponent of Iran, following a recent diplomatic spat between the two monarchies. Last month, Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of King Salman of Saudi Arabia, arrived in Laayoune in Western Sahara for a private visit.  The same month, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that Morocco maintains strong diplomatic ties with all Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In February 2014, Morocco and Iran planned to re-establish diplomatic ties. Four years later, a fresh dispute surfaced between the two countries. In May 2018, Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Iran one week before the United States announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Morocco said it was cutting ties over Iran’s supplying weapons to Polisario through Hezbollah. Facebook in February said it identified and took down hundreds of fake accounts linked to Iran which were disseminating pro-Iran narratives to influence political discourse in many countries, including Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale has informed the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and the Security Council of the adoption of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement by the EU Council of Ministers. Hilale conveyed that the adoption marks the “final stage of validation and ratification, on the European side, following the European Parliament’s adoption on February 12 in a plenary session in Strasbourg with the overwhelming majority of 415 votes in favor, 189 against and 49 absententions.” In two letters to Guterres and the fifteen members of the Security Council, Hilale said that the agreement does not “concern the political process on the Sahara issue conducted under the exclusive auspices of the United Nations.” Hilale brought to the UN’s attention that the agreement will “cover the Moroccan Sahara region and explicitly stipulate that the fishing zone extends from parallel 35 to the north, parallel 20 to the south, or Cape Spartel in Cap Blanc, south of the city of Dakhla.” The fisheries agreement was adopted after a series of negotiations between the Moroccan government and the EU bodies. Morocco now has to complete the “international ratification process” to finalize the adoption of the agreement. According to the EU council, Morocco will spend part of the money it receives for the deal to promote the sustainable development of the fisheries economy in Morocco and its southern provinces. The European Council reported that the deal takes into account the “judgement of the European Court of Justice of February 2018.” The court had ruled that the EU should not be allowed to make deals with Morocco including Western Sahara. The EU council said, “It should be possible for Union fleets to continue the fishing activities they had pursued since the entry into force of the Agreement, and the scope of application of the Agreement should be defined so as to include the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara.” The council decided that the continuation of the fisheries partnership is “essential in order for that territory to continue to benefit from the sectoral support provided under the Agreement, in compliance with Union and international law, including human rights, and for the benefit of the people concerned.”

Rabat – Spanish Minister of the Interior Fernando Grande-Marlaska has announced that Spain will remove the third layer of the border wall around the Spanish enclave of Melilla, to make the wall taller and non-injurious. Marlaska said that, in line with his investigative visit to Melilla, on Saturday, March 2, Spain will keep only two layers of the border wall but will increase the fence’s height from 6 meters to 8 or 10 meters. The government will remove the barbed wires from the fences and equip the border with CCTV cameras to facilitate its fight against irregular migration. The Spanish government intends for the border modifications to be secure but not to injure migrants. The same applies for the Ceuta border. The minister announced on February 23 that “the height of the fence will be increased by 30 percent, reaching ten meters, where most of the entries occurred.” Construction work at the borders of the Spanish enclaves have yet to start.  According to Marlaska, construction may start in about a month at the Ceuta border. According to figures presented by the conservative Spanish Popular Party (PP) during a meeting at the Spanish Parliament on February 26, the migration influx into the enclaves is 25 times higher in Ceuta and 50 times higher in Melilla compared to the national average.  PP maintained that the figures weigh on Spain’s ability to care for the migrants, especially in terms of healthcare. Read Also: Meanwhile, the Spanish National Institute of Health Management (INGESA) said that 30 percent of births in Ceuta and 60 percent of those in Melilla are children born to Moroccan mothers.  Young Moroccan migrants arriving at the enclaves represent the highest number of those arriving from other MENA countries. In 2018, almost all of the 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region who entered the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in northern Morocco were Moroccan, according to official data from Spanish authorities. Spain is also considering toughening requirements of Spanish citizenship for Moroccans living in Ceuta and Melilla.  The Spanish Parliament approved a draft law last week which dictates that foreigners in the two Spanish enclaves will only obtain citizenship after living there for 10 consecutive years as residents instead of one year. The bill maintains that children could only be considered Spanish if one of their parents had been born in Spain, reported Spanish news site El Faro de Ceuta.

Rabat – Travel website e-Dreams has again disparaged Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport, listing it at the top of its “ 5 worst airports in the world.” The travel website gave the airport a score of 3.19 stars out of 5. Second worst on the list was Rome’s Ciampino International Airport, followed by Berlin Tegel Airport, Berlin Schoenefeld Airport, and London Luton Airport. E-Dreams remarked on the two Berlin airports low score that “this may well be because they haven’t been upgraded in some time: both airports are due to be replaced by the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport which has been repeatedly postponed.”  The travel website also listed Casablanca as the worst airport in the world in 2018.  In response, Morocco’s National Office of Airports (ONDA) said that the online agency “operates through a system of online booking of flight tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars. Its conclusions are therefore based on the personal opinions and comments written by its users.” The website used over 50,000 reviews from 2018 to make this year’s conclusions. According to e-Dreams, the list has “changed a lot since 2017: only three of last year’s top 10 made the cut.” In March 2018, the Airport Service Quality awards ranked Casablanca as the best airport in Africa with over 2 million passengers per year. E-Dreams’s survey gave Singapore Changi Airport the highest ranking with a score of 4.47. Zurich Airport came second with 4.18, followed by Istanbul Ataturk Airport with 4.16, Copenhagen Airport, Munich Airport, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt Airport, Madrid Barajas, Rome Fiumicino Airport, and London Heathrow Airport.

Rabat – On International HPV Awareness Day, the MENA Coalition for HPV Elimination and the Tunisian Center for Public Health launched new data on the growing rate of HPV and cervical cancer-related deaths in the MENA region. An interactive map shared with MWN shows that Morocco has some of the highest rates of deaths by cervical cancer.  About 3.3 percent of women in the general Moroccan population are estimated to have “HPV type 16 or 18 at a given time, which causes approximately 79.4% of invasive cervical cancers in the country.” Cervical cancer is also one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among Moroccan women aged 15 and older. Each year, approximately 3,388 women find out they have cervical cancer. In 2018, about 2,465 women died of cervical cancer of the 13.2 million women in Morocco. The number of deaths caused by cervical cancer per year nearly doubled in the country between 2012 and 2018, increasing from 1,076 to 2,465. “If decisive action is not taken at the national level, annual deaths due to the disease will double again by 2040, reaching 4,570 deaths per year In Morocco.” In terms of HIV, the human immunodeficiency viruses, Morocco had between 1,000 and 1,500 new HIV infections and between 500 and 1,000 deaths associated with AIDS in 2016, according to the same data. In 2017, there were between 2 and 4 new cases of HIV per 100,000 people. Meanwhile in the general MENA region, over 7,600 women died from cervical cancer in 2018. Many others died due to other HPV-related cancers, including vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, mouth, and throat cancers, according to the latest data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The data also mentions the status of HPV vaccine which is the main protective measure against cervical cancer. People getting vaccinated should get the HPV vaccination before becoming sexually active. In the whole MENA region, Libya and the UAE are the only countries that have the HPV vaccine in their national immunization programs. Morocco introduced the HPV vaccination to eliminate cervical cancer in line with its 2025 health plan in 2015, and is still increasing efforts to expand health coverage and accessibility to vaccination.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Moroccan YouTuber Najib El Mokhtari held an interview with NASA astronaut Daniel Tani about his trips into outer space, space discoveries, and trending technologies in the aerospace industry. During the interview, Tani described how the earth looks like through the space shuttle window: “Our earth is beautiful. There are so many colors, textures, and shapes … At night, you can see cities, rivers.”

He continued, “The Nile [river] just lights up as it winds its way down. Looking out the window is just fantastic. I could never get enough.” Tani also described how almost all geopolitical borders are indistinguishable from outer space, making the world look like a global village.  Tani commented that one can “very, very rarely see political borders,” explaining that they are only visible when they follow the natural boundary of rivers. “When you look down, you think of humanity. You don’t think of nationality.” El Mokhtari remarked on scientific advances and that humans have managed to send robots to Mars, which he said “has been seen as a deity for millennia.” Tani noted that he thinks people will go even further: “It’s amazing to think, we built something and now it’s driving around Mars taking pictures and samples.” El Mokhtari wondered where Tani sees these space explorations going in the decades to come.

Tani responded that we “will continue to explore our space.” He believes the most exciting thing that’s happened in the past four or five years is that satellites “used to be the size of a school bus, now we are figuring out [that] it’s smarter to make a 10-centimeter satellite.” A number of these relatively tiny satellites will be launched and programmed to carry out various individual tasks, like taking pictures or measuring the depth of the ocean, instead of a large and costly single satellite performing a series of different functions at once. Will Morocco go to the moon? Tani expressed his delight at the interview with El Mokhtari and his time in Morocco, tweeting, “I was privileged to visit Morocco and I had a great interview with Najib – a famous personality in Morocco. We covered a lot of topics and had a wonderful time.” The interview was not limited to space trips and explorations; El Mokhtari and Tani also touched on the education system. Tani’s piece of advice was that he wishes Moroccan schools would integrate non-educators specializing in fields like accounting, law, etc., to come and explain, for example, “the basics of numbers” to bring a “different experience, a wealth of experience” to students. El Mokhtari said in a Facebook post that, during their pre-interview discussion, Tani told him “Moroccan talented youths are some of the best he has ever seen.” He also said he “is looking forward to the first Moroccan that’s going to build a satellite and get to space.” Science in Morocco A 2016 Web “Personality of the Year,” Najib El Mokhtari is an IT consultant in Morocco. Through his YouTube videos and blogs, El Mokhtari is dedicated to walking his viewers through complex science topics in simple Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in an easily digestible manner, making his videos accessible to a fan-base of more than 97,000 subscribers.  El Mokhtari’s YouTube channel and Othmane Safsafi’s “Science Math” YouTube and Facebook accounts are two of the most popular social media accounts, out of very few, devoted to the popularization of science in Morocco. Not only does he tackle scientific phenomena, El Mokhtari also conducts scientific experiments even with everyday equipment. In 2016, El Mokhtari met the renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in a conference in the Canary Islands and made a video in which Tyson addressed Moroccans.  After a career as a consultant supporting clients in over a dozen countries, El Mokhtari decided to come back to Morocco and started his popular YouTube science channel. The interview is part of the US embassy’s year-round events in celebration of the first moon landing’s 50th anniversary when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. The US launched its Apollo 11 mission to the moon on July 20, 1969. El Mokhtari’s interview was set up in coordination with the US embassy in Rabat, which organized a series of “Moonshot Morocco” events, beginning two weeks ago which will run until July. The purpose of the event, the US embassy wrote on Facebook, was “to focus on future leaders in science, technology, innovation, and risk-taking … helping Morocco’s talented youth achieve their full potential, and take on challenges as weighty and magnificent as sending a human to the moon.” In the same vein, the US Mission in Morocco held conferences in Kenitra, Casablanca, and Rabat.

Rabat – Moroccan Jewish activist Sion Assidon has opposed French President Emmanuel Macron  and a bill proposed by French lawmakers to criminalize anti-Zionism like anti-Semitism, which is already illegal in France. The Moroccan Jewish activist described anti-Zionism as a “political position.” Assidon told AFP that if “declaring oneself to be ‘anti-Zionist’ is seen as a racist act, that is serious.” The activist argued, “We must not limit ourselves to condemning one form of racial hatred alone, forgetting Muslims and gypsies.” “Why pass on Islamophobia?” Assidon asked.

Assidon also shared a letter with 400 signatures, addressed to Macron on his support of the criminalization of anti-Zionism. The letter argues that the French Constitution in Article 4 “guarantees pluralistic expressions of opinion.” The letter said that “anti-Zionism is an opinion, a current of thought born among European Jews at a time when Jewish nationalism was taking off.” “We want to let you know that we are anti-Zionists, or that some of our best friends declare themselves as such.” The signatories said they respect all human rights activists who “bravely fight and denounce the intolerable atrocities that the most zealous Zionists inflict on Palestinians.” The letter warned Macron that if he passes the law, the signatories would “break” the “unfair law with our words, our writings, our articles, works and our acts of solidarity.” In January, a Moroccan-French author of Jewish descent, Jacob Cohen, strongly criticized Zionism and the Holocaust. Cohen referred to the Holocaust as a “new religion” invented by Zionists.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The governor of the Draa-Tafilalet region in eastern Morocco, Yahdih Bouchaab, chaired a meeting on Saturday to discuss actions to combat the leishmaniasis disease.  Bouchaab stressed that the government should increase its efforts to decrease the number of people infected with the disease. Between 2004 and 2013, Morocco recorded 41,656 cases of leishmaniasis. In eastern Morocco, Errachidia, which saw a large population increase over the same period, registered 8,728 cases. Bouchaab called for close coordination between all territorial groups in the region, local authorities, and civil society to survey areas heavily affected by the disease to organize an awareness-raising campaign. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that tends to affect poor people. It is generally associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, and weak immune system. Most of the disease’ causal factors include perceived lack of financial resources. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 700,000 to 1 million new cases occur annually, of which 20,000 to 30,000 do not survive the disease. Bouchaab’s meeting included a presentation on the general framework for joint work on tracking the program to combat leishmaniasis in Errachidia. The presentation referred to the action plan that focused in particular on the number of exposed and treated cases.  Bouchaab stressed the need to raise awareness about the seriousness of the disease. The meeting included heads of the territorial groups in Errachidia, members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and representatives of the security services.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – Eleven days of mass protests in Algeria, the biggest protests in Algiers since the 2011 Arab Spring, have elicited an official letter by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika addressing the protests of the Algerian people.  Bouteflika, who has been in Switzerland since February 22 for routine medical checks, was unable to submit his papers for candidacy in person when they were due Sunday. Abdelghani Zaalane, Bouteflika’s campaign chief, ignored the absence of the Algerian president and submitted the official candidacy papers for Bouteflika. Zaalane also read out Bouteflika’s statement: “I have heard the pleas of protesters and especially the thousands of young people who asked about our nation’s future … I am committed to the organization of an early presidential election.”  If Bouteflika wins re-election on April 18, he promised a “national conference” would set a date for another election soon. “I pledge not to be a candidate for this election,” Bouteflika wrote. Abdelwahab Derbal, the head of the election commission, noted the absence of Bouteflika. He told reporters, “The rule is explicit. For a presidential election, all candidates must present themselves at the Constitutional Council to submit their candidacy papers.” It remains unclear if the constitutional council will approve Bouteflika’s candidacy. The mass protests, according to the mouwatana (Democracy and Citizenship) movement leader, Soufiane Djilali, aim “to get rid of not just the president, but the entire regime.” He further emphasized, “The people on the street don’t support [any] candidate.” Some opposition candidates supported Djilali’s claim, including former Prime Minister Ali Benflis, who came second in the 2014 presidential elections. He announced earlier on Sunday that he would refuse to join the presidential race and is calling for an election boycott. Two other opposition parties, the Labor Party, led by Louisa Hanoune, and the Islamist Movement Society for Peace, have announced that they will boycott the polls.

Rabat – The grand imam of Egypt’s Al-Azhar Islamic Institution, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, has said he believes that polygamy is often an injustice to women and children.” Al-Tayeb argued, “The practice is the result of a lack of understanding of the Qur’an and the tradition of the prophet.” He made the comments on his weekly television program and on Twitter. Al-Tayeb recited a verse from the Qur’an, Surah an-Nisa 4:3, which says that in order for a Muslim man to have multiple wives, he “must obey conditions of fairness—and if there is not fairness it is forbidden to have multiple wives.” Al-Tayeb explained, “We have to read the verse in full, and the part which says, ‘two, three and four wives,’ is only part of the verse, and not the entire verse, as having multiple wives oppresses the women and her children.” In his weekly television show on Friday, Al-Tayeb told viewers, “Those who say that marriage must be polygamous are all wrong.” The grand imam called for a broader revision in the way women’s issues are addressed. Over the weekend, social media commenters heavily debated Al-Tayeb’s remarks. The imam joined the debate, clarifying that he did not call for banning polygamy but for people to care more about women. “I do not call for legislation that abolishes the right of polygamy, but I reject any legislation that destroys the law of the Holy Qur’an or Sunnah,” he tweeted. “Women represent half of society. If we don’t care for them it’s like we are walking on one leg only,” he added.

Rabat – Ethiopian runner Yomif Kejelcha has broken Moroccan runner Hicham El Guerrouj’s 1997 world record for the indoor mile at Boston University’s super fast track on Monday. The 21-year-old Ethiopian completed the race in 3:47:01, outperforming El Guerrouj’s 3:48:45 record set in Ghent, Belgium. Kejelcha had previously said that he was determined to break both the 1,500-meter record held by fellow Ethiopian Samuel Tefera and the mile world record. The runner missed the 1,500-meter record (3:31:04) by finishing it at 3:31:25. El Guerrouj still holds three world records, the 2,000-meter set in Berlin in 1999, the outdoor 1,500-meter record of 3:26:00 set in 1998 in Rome, and the mile outdoor of 3:43:13 set in 1999 also in Rome. Ethiopia’s Samuel Tefera broke Hicham El Guerrouj’s 1,500-meter indoor world record with an outstanding performance in Birmingham on February 16.

Rabat – The Security Council will meet on April 9 and 10 to discuss the Western Sahara conflict and to consult on the UN peacekeeping mission in the region, MINURSO. The United Nations published the Provisional Programme of Work of the Security Council for April 2019, which includes two days of meetings on MINURSO. On April 1, the fifteen members of the Security Council are expecting a MINURSO “report due.” Later, the troop-contributing countries (TCC) to the conflict will meet on April 9 in the afternoon, and the Security Council will hold consultations on Wednesday, April 10. On April 29, the Security Council is set to adopt a new resolution on the conflict as the MINURSO mandate will expire on April 30 in accordance with Resolution 2440 adopted on October 31, 2018. The resolution renewed MINURSO’s mandate for six months. The Security Council, in the resolution, called on the parties to demonstrate political will to advance negotiations to end the conflict. The council also asked the Polisario Front to “adhere fully to its commitments to the Personal Envoy in respect of Bir Lahlou, Tifariti and the buffer strip at Guerguerat.” The Security Council also met on January 29 to consult on MINURSO.  During the meeting, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, informed the council he would invite the four parties involved in the conflict to take part in a new roundable in March. Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania met for a first roundtable in December 2018.

Rabat – Interior ministers from the Arab world have reiterated their countries’ genuine concern for regional security. Amid a flurry of shared security and terrorism related threats, it is urgent to come up with shared coping strategies and mechanisms, read the final declaration of the 36th summit of the Arab League’s interior ministers. Gathered in Tunis on Sunday, March 3, officials from the Arab world appeared to put aside national differences to commit a common agenda on terrorism. Burying their disagreements, they highlighted “a shared responsibility” in securing trans-border peace and security. In addition to promoting a common strategy to counterterrorism in the Arab world, the officials also put forward a motion to integrate their civil protection mechanisms based on recommendations from the 35th summit in 2018. Saudi Arabia’s interior minister Prince Abdulaziz Ibn Saoud Bin Naif Bin Abdelaziz Al Saoud, whose country currently chairs the Arab League’s reunions, pointed out the “necessity to intensify collaboration” on terrorism. Terrorism, extremism, and illicit transnational activities like human smuggling, the Saudi prince said, are not the business of any single country. Rather, they are the expression of coordinated efforts from transnational criminal groups and require interstate cooperation. Other representatives, including Tunisia’s Hichem Fourati, shared Al Saoud’s concerns. Despite minor differences in national approaches, the Tunisian said that a shared approach would benefit everyone in the league. Like his Saudi counterpart, Fourati stressed the importance of joint mechanisms aimed at “increasing the operational capacities” of security services across the Arab world. Although it has made headlines for its liberal reforms and democratic consolidation in recent years, Tunisia has been among the most recurrent targets of terrorist strikes. Right after the success of its 2011 Arab Spring, Tunisia seethed with extremism-prone youths, many of whom filled the ranks of ISIS in its combat zones. Comprehensive strategy Fourati hinted at that dire episode for the country’s young democratic experience as well as the challenges the Tunisian government has been facing in curbing radicalization. He argued that the prospective “shared strategy on counterterrorism” should go beyond interior and security ministries and implicate all echelons of government. “The fight against terrorism is an issue that concerns not only security services, but it calls for a comprehensive approach that would involve the contribution of all government departments, most notably education, culture, media, religion, social development, and economy,” Fourati said. Interior minister Abdelouafi Laftit, who led the Moroccan delegation, echoed similar sentiments. Morocco has globally stood out for effective anti-terrorism architecture. Still, Laftit suggested, like other countries in the region, Morocco remains exposed to threats like human trafficking, smuggling of illicit merchandise, and extremism. Recently, however, the most urgent security issues are cyber-criminality and the return of former ISIS fighters. While the Tunis summit did not spell out a clear policy for receiving former ISIS fighters, a number of participants, including Morocco’s Laftit, suggested they would be open to those who want to come back home. However, they stressed, de-radicalizing and facilitating socio-professional integration for former terrorists will be a considerable challenge.

Rabat –  Sahrawi activist and former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Sidi Mouloud  commented on the arrival of a Sahrawi delegation to Berlin for consultations with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler. In response to a post from the Polisario representative at the UN, Sidi Omar, Mustafa Salma said that if the meeting was pre-planned before, “the meeting’s result will not go beyond the registration [for the attendance].”  Sidi Omar wrote yesterday on Twitter that the Polisario delegation had arrived in Berlin for “bilateral consultations with President Kohler on 4-5 March.” He added that the front is strongly “committed to the UN-led peace process and to advancing the inalienable right of our people to self-determination and independence.”  The delegation of the Frente #POLISARIO is already in Berlin for the bilateral consultations with President Köhler on 4-5 March. We remain strongly committed to the #UN-led peace process and to advancing the inalienable right of our people to self-determination and independence. — Sidi Omar (@SidiOmarNY) March 3, 2019  Despite Morocco’s resolve that it will not accept a solution outside its Morocco’s sovereignty and autonomy plan, Polisario is still attached to its separatist project of self-determination and independence. In response to Sidi Omar, Mustafa Salma said on his Facebook account, “as long as Algerian citizens cannot decide their destiny yet, there is no self-determination for you.” Mustafa Salma referred to the on protests in Algeria after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika ignored protesters’ demands that he abstain from running for a fifth term.  Mustafa Salma has devoted his time to defending the human rights of Sahrawis and to commenting on the allegedly unbearable living conditions in Tindouf, Algeria, where many Sahrawis live. On February 28, Mustafa Salma spoke again about the critical health of a child who suffers epilepsy due to malnutrition. The child’s family has been protesting that Polisario is confining their movements in a sit-in in front of the MINURSO headquarters at Mijek, a town in Western Sahara near the Mauritanian border and 670 kilometers southwest of Tindouf. The family has been protesting what they call Polisario’s maltreatment of Sahrawis. According to Mustafa Salma, Polisario and MINURSO have neglected the family’s demands. On February 26, Mustafa Salma said that the child would be transferred to a hospital 700 kilometers from Mijek because he was going into a coma due to his condition. In another post, Mustafa Salma wrote that because of the seriousness of his condition, the child was transferred again to the Polisario military hospital in Tindouf, from where he would be moved to another hospital 2,300 kilometers away. “The family of Mohammed, who left the camps and took refuge in the MINURSO mission to escape the exploitation of Polisario found themselves forced to go back to Polisario’s camps.” In addition to Polisario, Kohler plans to meet with representatives from Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania before holding a second roundtable discussion with all the parties later this month. The roundtable will be the second of its kind after the first roundtable in December in Geneva.

Rabat – Morocco’s tourism minister Mohamed Sajid has announced plans to rebuild Fez’s image for coming tourism seasons. Known as the cultural and spiritual capital of Morocco, Fez is one of the oldest cities in the Muslim world. The city’s 1,200-year-old medina (walled city), home to the world’s first modern university, one of the world’s first hospitals for mental illness, and scores of old madrasas (Islamic high schools), is a warehouse of Islamic and Amazigh (Berber) history, culture, and civilization. In recent decades, however, Fez has been the forgotten city in Moroccan authorities’ urbanization plans. The medina bears signs of neglect and dilapidation, while other tourist attractions around its old and new towns only attract a handful of history, art, and religion enthusiasts. Sajid’s plan is to change that and “give back to the city its old attractiveness,” according to an official statement quoted by “Aujourd’hui le Maroc” on March 3. The goal of the plan is to reclaim its medieval beauty and attractiveness, making it possible for the country’s spiritual capital to be recognized and cited among the best tourist destinations that Morocco has to offer. As part of the plan, the ministry hosted an awareness-raising event it called “Media Influence Day” over the weekend in Fez. The objective was to exhibit the city’s rich cultural and artistic history participants, most of whom were media workers. One downside of “Media Influence Day,” however, Aujourd’hui le Maroc reported, was that the city’s municipal authorities did not think much of the event, not even bothering to attend. One reason, the newspaper speculated, is that the city’s authorities, having seen Fez cast away in years of sustained disinterest in Fez and lack of national policy to promote Fez as a tourist destination, may have lost confidence in projects like Sajid’s. It will take more than a three-day public relations event to convince them. But “Media Influence Day” has not been the only move in the direction of the tourism ministry’s plans to rehabilitate Fez. Since the first half of 2018, the city has seen a resurgence of government-funded reconstruction projects. Under King Mohammed VI, an initial MAD 583 million urbanization project was launched in 2018 to give the city a new and attractive look. The project included the renovation of dozens of historical monuments, street maintenance, improved or modernized urban planning, the construction of new parking spots with extended capacity, and reconstruction work in and around the medina.

Rabar – The German Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) group has placed a satirical figurine of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) at the entrance of As-Sunnah Mosque in the Hague, the Netherlands. On Sunday, Pegida—notorious for targeting mosques in the Netherlands with Islamophobic acts—hung a banner with an obscene message insulting the prophet next to a mannequin dressed in traditional Arab male dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint. Vanochtend is stg. as-Soennah door neonazi’s van Pegida op een verschrikkelijke manier aangevallen. Wij zijn vaker slachtoffer geweest van haat en bedreigingen uit neonazistische hoek, maar nooit eerder op zo’n lugubere wijze. Let op! Schokkende beelden! https://t.co/5vlBRkNHIy pic.twitter.com/MPYySMnlc1 — Al-Yaqeen (@alyaqeenweb) March 3, 2019 CCTV footage of the incident, which has circulated social media, shows three hooded individuals pulling the banners and mannequin from a vehicle parked in front of the mosque late at night. 

Abdelhamid Taheri, the head of the mosque, told Dutch news outlet Omroep West that worshippers found the insulting messages when they arrived at the mosque to perform the morning prayer and immediately called the police. To Taheri, “It is not an attack against the mosque alone, but an attack against the whole Muslim world.” He added that he has reported similar attacks on the mosque several times but they have continued. As-Sunnah Mosque and other mosques in the region have been targeted by Pegida on several occasions.  Last year during Ramadan, Pegida took advantage of Islam’s restriction on the consumption of pork, regarded as “impure,” to provoke Muslims by roasting pigs in front of Laleli Mosque in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, at the time of breaking the fast. At the same time, Pegida had shared a series of posts on Facebook, encouraging its followers to participate in pig barbeques in front of many mosques, including As-Sunnah Mosque. The Pegida followed in the steps of previous offensive drawings and caricatures insulting Prophet Muhammad. Some of the most notorious satirical caricatures of Muhammad (PBUH) were published in Denmark in 2005, triggering outrage among Muslims across the world.

Rabat – Contractual teachers began a “six-day regional sit-in” across the country accompanied by a “national strike” on Monday. The National Federation of Teachers (UMNT) expressed its solidarity with the teachers and denounced what they called “retaliatory actions against teachers who were forced to sign contracts.” The UNMT called on the government and the Ministry of Education to provide fair and urgent solutions for contractual teachers to end growing tensions in the sector. The federation has further called on all UNMT teachers to support the sit-ins. It also reiterated its condemnation of “the contractual employment, confronting protests with reprisals, and intimidation policy.” UNMT is accusing the government of “discriminating between teachers” in Morocco by hiring some teachers through contractual employment with regional academies for a fixed term.  Unlike the permanent teachers employed as regular government employees, contractual teachers do not have access to health coverage and a pension fund. Although they receive the same salary, contractors are getting paid by the academies with whom they have contracted.  “All these kinds of extortion and tension will only make us more determined and persistent to achieve our goal of integration [into public sector employment] and terminate the contract program,” said the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contractual Teaching (CNPCC) in a press release. The protests started February 18-20, when hundreds of contractors took to the streets to denounce the government’s “disregard” for their needs, “poor” social dialogue negotiations, problems in education and healthcare, and the deterioration of their situation. On February 20, contractual teachers led a protest march from the Parliament on Rabat’s Avenue Mohammed V to the Ministry of Education at Bab Rouah, which is also near the entrance to the Royal Palace of Rabat. As the protesters came near the Royal Palace, security forces intervened, re-establishing order by firing water cannons at teachers they said were getting violent and injuring dozens. The strikers say they want to be integrated into public sector employment and get medical care, pensions, and the same labor protections as permanent teachers. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on Thursday, February 21, after the weekly government meeting, that the government is keen to respond to the contractual teachers’ claims.

Rabat – The UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation have published statistics on modern slavery in 2018 in 181 countries. In Morocco, 85,000 people live in some form of modern slavery. The 2018 Global Slavery Index shows that 0.002 percent of Moroccans live in modern slavery, and 48.34 percent of the population are vulnerable to modern slavery. Morocco, has some of the lowest levels of slavery prevalence in Africa and has made significant improvements in modern slavery legislation. The report noted that both Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire enacted comprehensive trafficking laws since 2016. The Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the Congo have the highest levels of vulnerability to modern slavery, whereas Mauritius and Tunisia have the lowest levels of vulnerability in Africa. Tunisia has 25,000 victims of modern slavery while Algeria has 106,000 victims. Africa has the highest average vulnerability to modern slavery at 62 percent, with a poor performance in governance issues and lack of basic needs. The governments taking the most action to combat modern slavery are the Netherlands, the US, the UK, Sweden, Belgium, Croatia, Spain, Norway, Portugal, and Montenegro.  The aforementioned countries are “characterised by strong political will, high levels of resources, and a strong civil society that holds these governments to account for their actions to respond to modern slavery,” wrote ILO. As for countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, the report did not include their statistics “due to the ongoing conflict and extreme disruption to government.” Worldwide, slavery affects more than 40 million people.  Women and girls are overrepresented, making up 71 percent of all modern slavery victims while children make up 25 percent and account for 10 million of all victims of slavery. Forced labor, or modern slavery, as defined by ILO, includes “traditional practices of forced labour, such as vestiges of slavery or slave-like practices, and various forms of debt bondage, as well as new forms of forced labour that have emerged in recent decades, such as human trafficking.” Modern slavery is a reality lived by people who are victims of human trafficking, those forced to be housemaids or married against their will. “Labour extracted through force, coercion, or threats produces some of the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the footballs we kick,” wrote the Global Slavery Index. “The minerals that men, women, and children have been made to extract from mines find their way into cosmetics, electronics, and cars, among many other products,” read the Global Slavery Index. In 2016, an estimated 40.3 million men, women, and children were living in slavery; 24.9 million of these people were in forced labor and 15.4 million people were forced to marry. Estimates in the same year put the number of modern slavery victims in Morocco at 219,700. In terms of human trafficking in the country, the government convicted slightly more traffickers in 2018 than the previous year, after carrying out more investigations.  According to the US Department of State’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, however, the Moroccan government did not fund specialized protection services exclusively for the victims of human trafficking, therefore not “fully meet[ing] the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.”

Rabat – The European Union’s Council of Ministers has approved the EU Parliament’s  conclusion of the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU. The council of Ministers met today in Brussels to adopt the implementation of the agreement’s protocol and the exchange of letters accompanying the agreement. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the adoption offers a formal point of view on the agreement, which was approved by the European Parliament on February 12. The agreement now has to be ratified and adopted by the Moroccan government and legislative bodies. Quoting a statement from the EU council, MAP said that the four-year deal allocates fishing opportunities to the EU in exchange for €208 million from the EU. The statement added that Morocco will spend a large portion of the funds to promote the sustainable development of fishing in Morocco, including  its southern provinces. The EU council also noted that the objective of the agreement is to enable the EU and Morocco to work more closely together to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and the responsible use of fishing. The statement by the council also recalled the negotiations between the EU and Morocco, emphasizing that the European Commission has assessed the deal’s potential impact on sustainable development, especially with regard to the benefits for the populations concerned and the use of the natural resources of the southern provinces. The council emphasized that the fisheries agreement “should be of great benefit to the populations concerned, because of the positive socio-economic benefits for these populations, particularly in terms of employment, and investments.” The agreement, added the council, represents the best “guarantee for the sustainable use of the natural resources of waters adjacent” to the southern provinces of Morocco. On February 12, Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch said that “the population of the southern provinces has played a remarkable role in this process by expressing its voice and contributing in a committed way to defending its interests and rights as Moroccan citizens of the southern provinces.” Akhannouch commented that thousands of people in the southern provinces work in the fisheries sector. The agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The chairman of the US Congress’s House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, has said he will request documents from over 60 people and organizations today as part of an investigation into President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice. Nadler, a Democrat in the House of Representatives, will ask for documents from people with links to the White House and the Trump Organization. The list, which will include Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., and Adam Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, will be released today.  The judiciary chairman said he would initiate investigations into Trump for abuse of power, corruption, and obstruction of justice. Nadler believes it is “very clear” that Trump obstructed justice. Trump’s firing of former FBI director James Comey is evidence of that, according to Nadler. “My job,” Nadler said, “is to protect the rule of law.” In American television channel ABC’s “This Week” program, Nadler said the Republicans have been protecting Donald Trump from proper accountability, threatening “to impeach justice department officials.” He said their threatened Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 US election. Nadler said his investigation will go beyond allegations of the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia, even if Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the allegations, proves there were links between the Trump election campaign and Russia.  “We would want to see the evidence behind that and see the validity of that, we could agree or disagree,” Nadler stated. “But this investigation goes far beyond collusion.” Trump has repeatedly denied accusations that he colluded with Russia in his election campaign. In a tweet on Sunday, he said, “I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted &amp; corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &amp; should never have been allowed to start.” …said was a total lie, but Fake Media won’t show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted &amp; corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &amp; should never have been allowed to start – And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2019

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit spoke about Morocco’s strategy for terrorism and extremism  at the opening session of the 36th Council of Arab Ministers of the Interior in Tunis on Sunday. The Moroccan official said that Morocco is committed to adhere to any initiative that would enhance the collective security of Arab countries in the context of international legitimacy. Laftit said that the fight against terrorism is a long term issue, emphasizing that the first action to stop the spread of extremism is to end its ideological sources. Laftit also spoke about Morocco’s “mosalaha” reconciliation program, a project to integrate prisoners convicted of terrorism into society. Laftit said that Morocco is aware of the importance of reintegration for prisoners, which requires a practical approach in line with multidimensional efforts based on proactivity, increasing the spiritual security of citizens, and fighting poverty. The General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) launched mosalaha in 2018. The program offers prisoners convicted of terror offences psychological support and rehabilitation from human rights experts and anti-radicalization experts. Mosala, however, is not enough to curb terrorism inside prisons, according to a study from the US Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. According to the study, “Of the jihadis imprisoned in [2002-2018], 220 had previously been arrested on terrorism charges.” The study implied that there is a high rate of recidivism among released prisoners in Morocco. Morocco aware of the danger  During the meeting, Laftit also spoke about the growing threat of links between terror groups and organized crime networks. He said that Morocco is adopting a comprehensive approach to tackle criminal acts of terrorism, which he said is led by undocumented migration. Speaking about migration, Laftit described Morocco’s migration policy as a modern project that combines profound political reforms and the democratic process based on international standards. According to Laftit, the policy elevated Morocco from a transit country to a host country for migrants as well. Morocco regularized more than 50,000 undocumented migrants, giving them access to education and health coverage.

Rabat – President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth mandate was not only a miscalculation. More than a mishap, the move now stands for a “discredited” and “weakened regime” that no longer has a place in Algeria’s political scene. That is according to Ali Benouari, a former minister under President Bouteflika. Speaking to Swiss outlet Tribune de Geneve, the former Algerian treasury minister spoke of the country’s president as a shadow of his former self. No longer the buoyant, militant, and loved character he once was, Bouteflika has become the one name that no Algerian wants to associate with “president,” Benouari argued. The sight of an old, ailing, dying president is one theater that Algerians can no longer bear. When the National Liberation Front (FLN), President Bouteflika’s party, realizes that a fifth term is “impossible,” both the party and the president will be obliged to give in to popular pressure, according to Benouari. “He will not run because no doctor in Algeria will deliver him a medical certificate saying that he is well and fit to run for president.” Further hammering home the mission-impossible-filled sense of the FLN’s and President Bouteflika’s desire to remain at the helm of the country, Benouari explained that “it is now an open secret” that the president is terminally sick and ill-disposed to run the country. “There is absolutely no doubt about his incapacity to govern Algeria…. Politically, it is over for him. He has reached his end, and is rejected by the people. ” Benouari’s severe indictment of the Bouteflika regime comes amid popular unrest as waves of Algerians—especially students and unemployed youth—take to the streets to protest against Bouteflika’s candidacy for a fifth term. According to the former minister, the president’s entourage knew that a fifth term bid could public furor. So why did they make the move anyway, in spite of the potential risk of worsening the country’s longtime crisis of economic underperformance? “Because they want to buy time… They will resist until they find themselves an honorable exit door,” Benouari offered. As far the president entourage is concerned, the political theatre playing out in Algeria is more about saving themselves than it is about loyalty to President Bouteflika. “There are signs of panic in his entourage. Members of his inner circle are in search of an exit opportunity,” he said. “In 20 years they squandered $1000 billion. They fear that they will be sued and imprisoned after Bouteflika leaves the presidency.” While the regime has been weakened and is about to be outgunned by two or three opposition figures who have grown in popularity, it will fight for survival until it finds “an honorable exit.” Algerians have made it abundantly clear that Bouteflika has no chance to contest again, and a replacement for Bouteflika is now a “matter of utmost urgency” for the FLN. Rupture and resentment Even then, though, the presidential entourage will have hard time finding a replacement that the Algerian people can trust and relate to. Having suffered economic stagnation and political paralysis under Bouteflika in the last years, Algerians want an “independent political figure” that will inspire change and instigate “total rupture from the current infective regime.” While Benouari’s remarks may be politically motivated—he was denied a place in the race for president in 2014—his scathing indictment of the current Algerian regime has been buttressed by the ongoing protests. So big and unexpected have the waves of protesters been in recent days that some are already speaking of the “beginning of the end” for the Bouteflika regime. Like Benouari, the general mood seems to be that Bouteflika and his clan cannot survive the ongoing popular outburst of frustration. A recent BBC report called the protests “a rare show of dissent,” emphasizing that the North African country has not witnessed such exhibition of public fervor since the chaotic 1990s. And while President Bouteflika’s presidential obstinacy sparked the uproar, what the protests boil down to an accumulation of grievances and resentment. “There is a sense of awakening. Past lessons have been learned. The Algerian people has gained in maturity. It [the people] is now taking its fate in its own hands,” Benouari said.

Usman continued until the finals where he faced Hayder Hassan on July 12, 2015. He won the final via submission in the second round and was consequently signed by the UFC for a six-figure contract. The Nigerian Nightmare has lost only one fight out of 15 in his professional career.

Rabat – “Bouteflika, leave!” and “No fifth mandate for you” are some of the most popular slogans chanted by Algerian protesters opposing the Algerian President’s decision to run for a fifth mandate. Hundreds of students and activists took to the streets to condemn Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision on Sunday in Algiers. Bouteflika has until midnight to depose his candidature to run for a fifth mandate. The government mobilized hundreds of police and soldiers to face the protests. Similar protests are also ongoing in several cities and towns. On Friday, clashes broke out between police and protesters, resulting in injuries among security services and demonstrators. The protesters marched in major cities including Constantine, Setif, Tizi, and Algiers. The protests started last week. Despite the massive demonstrations opposing Bouteflika’s decision, the 82-year president is determined to submit his official application to seek re-election. In addition to the protests, activists also launched an online campaign to oppose Bouteflika’s fifth term. The activists also launched the social media campaign, “Let Him Rest,” implying that Algerian elites are pushing Bouteflika to re-elect himself for the fifth term. Algeria will hold its 2019 presidential elections on April 18. Candidates have to submit their candidatures personally to the constitutional council, according to Sky News Arabia. Bouteflika left Algeria last week for his “routine” medical check. Algerian news outlets did not report whether the president is currently in Algeria or he is still in Geneva. It remained to be seen whether Bouteflika will make it to the constitutional council to submit his candidature personally before midnight.

By Najoua Bijjir Paris – He is a luminary in the world of well-known artists. Among his clients are none other than Rihanna, Akon, Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, Sean Paul, Nas, Tyga, and 50 Cent. Music manager Mani, 44, has been involved in the worldwide music industry for two decades through his successful business the American Artist Company. You’re the president of the American Artist Company. What kind of services do you provide?  We are a booking management company and we provide touring services for well-known artists, such as Drake, Bruno Mars, and even the Gypsy Kings. But we’re a lot more than that. We’re also involved in publishing, the movie industry, and product branding. I just came back from India where we had a private event with Tinie Tempah and we’re going to collaborate with Philipp Plein to shoot a commercial for 50 Cent’s sneaker brand. You founded your company twenty years ago. Why was the mainstream audience not familiar with your achievements? I founded my company in 1999 in New York. The reason the mainstream audience didn’t know me is that I chose not to be in the spotlight. My number one focus has always been to work hard and it was never about being famous. You’re from France and originally of Moroccan descent. What was your childhood like? I was born in Fez and at a very young age, I migrated with my parents to Dijon, France. I grew up in an area similar to a ghetto. My parents didn’t speak French and we had very little money. Yet I had a very happy childhood because we had each other. We came with nothing to France and I always tell my parents: You gave us everything. They gave us love, and that’s the only thing that matters. How did you start your career as a music manager? When I was 12 years old I went to conservatory, where I won the top prize for dancing. The Ministry of Culture provided me with a grant to study at the Broadway Dance Centre in New York. I was very committed to hard work, taking classes during the day and practicing each evening. Later I became a choreographer and a modern jazz dancer. I was always committed to my career and I had to work hard to stay in shape. I danced in Broadway productions such as Charlie Chaplin and I performed during concerts with Stevie Wonder and Janet Jackson.        When did you decide to make a career-switch? When I was 24 years old I realized that I couldn’t dance at a high level for life. I started to build up my connections with well-known artists through my work as a choreographer and a dancer. I realized that I had two dreams and they were: One, being my own boss and two, waking up whenever I wanted to. There’s nothing better than having your freedom. In some ways freedom is very expensive. I believe you have to work hard to make it happen. What do you consider the most important things in life? My family and my friends are very important to me. I love to travel, be free and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I thank my parents for that. I grew up in a ghetto and I stayed away from trouble, only because I had a strong relation with my parents. I couldn’t image doing something wrong and causing them harm. My parents gave us, all five of their children, the confidence to be who we are. Education is also a very important thing in life. I believe that a loved and educated child is unlikely to do any harm. Once we came with nothing, and now we have everything. I’ve learned that people always want more, they always want something else. When I was younger, all sorts of stuff amazed me. Now I have it all, but I am not impressed by it. Money can give you freedom, but at the same time it is nothing. Money is just a key. Having my own family with kids really changed my life. I used to close my phone during major concerts. I was never reachable and was very busy. After I married things changed. I’m still busy, but now I want to stay in touch with my family all the time. Whenever I see my child, I forget about everything else.  How would you describe your ties with Morocco? It’s always great to be back in Morocco. Fez, Marrakesh… you name it. I am involved in different festivals in Morocco. Next year we will be organizing two big festivals. You can stay updated by following me on Instagram. Aside from your career you’re involved in philanthropy. What particular projects are you working on these days? We’re starting up a concept called BVibes Management that helps potential talent to become successful outside of Morocco. I like to inspire others and do more for Moroccans. I’ve traveled the world and I’ve seen Moroccans everywhere. They’re always creative, inspired and involved in entrepreneurship. They’re visible in all sorts of fields. We Moroccans have everything we need to make it happen, and that’s a great quality. I believe that when you receive, you have to give. Do you have tips or advice for our readers?  To go far, you have to know where you came from. You have deep roots and you need to be proud of them. Be proud to be a Moroccan, an Arab and a Muslim. To achieve your goals you have to be committed and work hard. Success is like a recipe; you have to use the right amount of ingredients for it to come out.

Rabat – Algerian protesters are expressing their anger over Bouteflika’s decision to run for the fifth mandate through several means. A video online shows a group of Algerians carrying a fake coffin with a picture of Bouteflika and a Moroccan flag covering the coffin. À Bejaia le “cercueil” de Bouteflika est enveloppé d’un drapeau marocain. Bcp de monde. #NON_AU_5EME_MANDAT #Algerie pic.twitter.com/6LwYhJuYzd — Sabri B (@sabribac) 1 mars 2019  Algerians also chanted several slogans to condemn Bouteflika’s decision to re-elect himself for the fifth mandate. The list of the popular slogans chanted during protests include: “no fifth mandate for the Moroccan Bouteflika.” The 82 year old president was born in 1937 in Morocco’s eastern city Oujda. In power since 1999, Algerian activists are against his determination to run for a fifth mandate for questioning his ability to lead. Activists also created the Let_Him_Rest or “Khalouh Yertah” hashtag, implying that some Algerian elites in power pushed the president to run for the fifth term. After he suffered from a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public. Algeria will hold its presidential elections on April 18.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has decided to dismiss the president of his presidential campaign Abdelmalek Sellal, reported the Algerian news agency APS. Transport minister Abdelghani Zaalene replaced Sellal, who was in charge of Bouteflika’s previous three re-elections. Bouteflika’s cabinet did not explain Bouteflika’s decision to replace  Sellal. The dismissal of Sellal followed massive protests against Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth mandate. The decision comes after the release of leaked recording , which is allegedly a conversation between Sellal and Ali Haddad, the chairman of the Forum of Business Leaders. In the recording, which went viral on Algerian social media, Sellal was heard saying that security services would be ordered to confront protesters and the gendarmes would not go easy on them. On February 22, hundreds of activists took to the streets across Algeria to condemn Bouteflika’s campaign. Algerian police arrested 41 protesters last week during the protests.

Rabat – Venezuela’s interim President Juan Guaido reiterated gratuite for Morocco’s support for the aspirations of the Venezuelan people. Guaido expressed  his gratitude during a meeting with Moroccan ambassador to Brazil Nabil Adghoghi on Thursday. During the meeting, Guaido recalled that Morocco was the first Arab and African country to provide support for the Venezuelan people’s aspirations for democracy and freedom. The interim president also renewed his willingness to build  “strong and confident” diplomatic bonds with Morocco. This is not the first time Guaido has expressed his willingness to restore diplomatic ties with Morocco. In an interview held in February with Emirati television channel Al Ghad, Guaido addressed a special message to Morocco. “We thank the Arab world, and Morocco especially, for its supporting position for us,” he said. In January, foreign affairs advisor of the Venezuelan assembly, Manuel Avendano, expressed his interim government’s determination to re-establish diplomatic relations with Morocco. Avendano also said that Venezuela will “reconsider its recognition of the Sahrawi Republic” under Guaido. On January 29, Guaido held a conversation with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita  by telephone, informing him that Morocco supports all the actions Guaido is taking for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change.

Rabat – Are you confused or simply don’t know what to eat in Morocco? After living in Rabat for six months, I compiled a list of some of my favorite places to grab a bite in the city, for any price range.
 While Rabat may not be known for its food scene, with many new restaurants opening up around the city, there is now a larger variety of cuisines and atmospheres to choose from.
 The medina For low-priced food, the best place to go is the medina (old city). Inside the medina you can find all kinds of sandwiches, sweets, juices, and breads. Medina sandwiches often range between MAD 5 and 10 and are a delicious and quick bite.  In addition, you can buy warm harcha (a pan-fried bread made from semolina), msemen (a puffed pancake), sfenj (ring of dough fried in oil), or baghrir (a spongy pancake with many holes) as a breakfast or snack, ranging between MAD 1 and 5. My favorite is harcha with amlou (a paste made of almonds, argan oil, and honey, similar to peanut butter) in the morning or an MAD 1 beignet in the afternoon. Top Batido On Avenue Mohammed V, Top Batido is a great smoothie and breakfast spot. With smoothies ranging between MAD 13-30 and low-priced breakfasts, the restaurant is a great spot to start the day, meet with others, or study. The two-story eatery has excellent service, a menu with endless fruit and vegetable combinations, wifi, and a bathroom. My favorite smoothies are the avocado-coconut and the banana-cafe. Babel In Agdal, Babel is an Iraqi restaurant that includes food options from around the Levant region. With to-go or dine-in options, the well-priced and filling food is a must. The atmosphere of the restaurant benefits from tasteful decorations and includes indoor and outdoor seating as well as bathrooms. The MAD 20 falafel sandwiches, MAD 20 lentil soup, or the MAD 55 assortment platter are must-try items. Cafe ByBou In Hassan, ByBou is a decently priced breakfast, lunch, or snack spot. The restaurant has delicious omelets as well as large banana-nutella crepes. With indoor and outdoor seating options, as well as wifi, if you are in Hassan, make sure to check it out. Los Burros Recently opened on Avenue Al Abtal in Agdal, Los Burros provides the best Mexican-inspired food I have tried so far in Rabat. The small restaurant with vibrant ambience and inviting atmosphere, has many food options. With MAD 29 chicken burritos as well as a variety of salads, quesadillas, tacos, and bowls, if you have a craving for Mexican food, make sure to try it out.  Maison Beyrouth In Agdal, Maison Beyrouth presents a variety of Lebanese foods with beautiful decor and Lebanese music. The well-priced menu offers delicious MAD 25 shawarma sandwiches; a variety of dips such as hummus, mutabbal, and muhammara; and various meat-based platters. However, what makes the restaurant stand apart are its creative desserts. A variety of MAD 35 fruits made out of white chocolate with fluffy mousse are a must-try. Yamal Acham Right next to Bab El Had, Yamal Acham is well known for its delicious Syrian food. From the mint lemonade juice to the large fattoush salads to the delicious hummus with shawarma, the lively restaurant serves food that is consistently delicious and well-priced. In addition, the off-menu assortment platter is perfect if you are going in large groups. If you want to get Syrian food in Rabat, this is the place to go. Pause Gourmet Hidden on Avenue Mohammed V, Pause Gourmet offers average-priced drinks, wraps, and salads. What makes this place special is its healthy and filling salad options as well as delicious wraps for a reasonable price. The menu has a large variety of options to choose from and the secluded nature of the small restaurant makes it easy to converse or study. Label Suisse Chocolat In Agdal, Label Suisse is a chocolate-based cafe that serves a variety of chocolates, pastries, and drinks. Ordering one of the many varieties of hot chocolate is a must. The types of hot chocolate range from white chocolate to incredibly dark, rich chocolate. The prices are also very reasonable. On the second floor, the restaurant also serves fondues. Carrion Coffee Attached to the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, this cafe is the perfect spot to go and study or meet with a colleague. With a clean interior, access to bathrooms, and a variety of drink and food options, the cafe is a peaceful spot to be. Coffees range from MAD 17-20, and while it is attached to the museum, there is a separate entrance to the cafe, so you do not have to pay the entrance fee. Cafe Terminus In the center of Centreville, Cafe Terminus is on the rooftop of the Onomo Hotel. While the prices for food and drinks are on the expensive side with a cafe latte priced at MAD 40, the view is worth the price. The indoor and outdoor cafe has the best view in Rabat overlooking the city with an airy and simple decor. One can also get delicious crepes or, at night, get cocktails overlooking the city. Dar Naji With three restaurants, near Bab el Had, in Agdal, and in Menzeh, Dar Naji serves a variety of Moroccan foods. The restaurant, with beautiful Moroccan decor, caters to small and large groups with beautiful and delicious platters of rfissa (trid au poulet), couscous, bastilla, and a variety of tagines. The prices are generally reasonable as well. When going to the rooftop restaurant by Bab el Had, make sure to get the traditional Moroccan mint tea, which is gracefully poured from over the waiters’ heads.

Rabat – The World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index ranked Morocco 74th globally, down from 67th place in the last report in 2018 report. The report takes into account the rule of law based on several criteria, including constraints on government power, absence of corruption and criminal justice. In the regional ranking, Morocco ranked fifth among countries in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). The eight surveyed MENA countries include Jordan, UAE, Tunisia, Algeria, Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon as well as Morocco. The UAE topped the MENA list, followed by Jordan, Tunisia, and Algeria, respectively. In the global index, Morocco ranked 8th on the list of lower middle income countries.  When looking at constraints on government powers, Morocco ranked 68th. According to the report, the constraints on government “measures the extent to which those who govern are bound by law.” The country also ranked 70th in the absence of corruption, as opposed to 59th place last year. The absence of corruption factor measures three forms of corruption: “bribery, improper influence by public or private interests, and misappropriation of public funds or other resources.” The three measures are reviewed “with respect to government officers in the executive branch, the judiciary, the military, police, and the legislature,” according to the report.  Regarding security and order, Morocco ranked 74th globally and fifth regionally. This was again a negative change from 2018 when Morocco ranked 70th globally and 4th regionally.
 This factor examined “how well a society ensures the security of persons and property.” Regarding regulatory enforcement, Morocco ranked 51st globally and fourth regionally. The factor reviews regulations and how they are “fairly and effectively” implemented. On the scale of civil justice, Morocco ranked 63rd globally. This factor examines whether “ordinary people can resolve their grievances peacefully and effectively through the civil justice system.” Morocco ranked 79th in criminal justice, which measures the country’s criminal justice system. “An assessment of the delivery of criminal justice should take into consideration the entire system, including the police, lawyers, prosecutors, judges, and prison officers.” Morocco scored the worst in the remaining categories: Open Government, Fundamental Rights, and Criminal Justice. In the open government scale, Morocco ranked 89th as opposed to 84 in 2018. This category is defined by the “extent to which a government shares information, empowers people with tools to hold the government, and fosters citizens participation in public policy deliberation.” The fundamental rights scale ranked Morocco at the bottom of the list: 100th, underscoring  that Morocco must increase efforts to ensure more fundamental rights for citizens. In the 2018 report, Morocco ranked 93rd. Finland and Denmark topped the scale.  The report said that countries’ scores and rankings for the WJP Rule of Law Index 2019 are taken from more than 120,000 household surveys and 3,800 expert surveys in 126 countries and jurisdictions. “The Index is the world’s most comprehensive dataset of its kind and the only to rely principally on primary data, measuring countries’ adherence to the rule of law from the perspective of ordinary people and their experiences,” according to WJP.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities mentioned Amnesty International annual report, “The State of the World’s Human Rights 2017/2018,” saying that the organization “ignores” the country’s positive developments.  Amnesty International, say Moroccan authorities, brings forth false information and makes it appear as facts. The NGO mentioned in its analysis Morocco’s bleak record on freedom of expression represented in the arrest and sentencing of journalists and people who express their opinions on social media. In response, the Moroccan authorities stressed that they do not arbitrarily arrest people like the organization seemed to imply. Instead, they argued, individuals have been arrested for offences such as “incitement of terrorism, rape and other crimes.” Amnesty’s report also claimed that Moroccans are not free enough to be founders or members of civil society associations.  Moroccan authorities criticized the statement for being “inaccurate.” They pointed out  that the report failed to mention that there are 140,000 active associations in the country. In terms of authorities’ crackdown on freedom of assembly, Amnesty International found only two cases.   Bu tit described the two cases as illustrations of excessive or unnecessary use of force. The two cases were only an exception and not the rule against which to measure the level of freedom of assembly in Morocco, according to Moroccan authorities. The fact is that no prison sentences have been imposed on peaceful demonstrators, as indicated in the report, but rather on practices and acts against the law. As for allegations of unfair trials and of torture, the report claimed the courts continue to convict activists after heavy trials, relying heavily on forced confessions. It did not, however, provide any basis or evidence to reach this conclusion. The trials referred to in the report were not directly witnessed by the organization.  The cases in question are still before the judiciary, which remains the only competent authority to do justice and provide reparation to litigants. Morocco is making efforts to regularize and integrate migrants by defining a legal framework for migration and asylum.  While a number of international human rights groups have applauded Morocco’s humanitarian efforts in the MENA region,, Amnesty International went the other way, according to the Moroccan government.  Amnesty claimed that the authorities had launched a major campaign of discriminatory repression targeting thousands of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. It added that they raided random neighbourhoods and houses occupied by refugees and migrants, and illegally arrested thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, including children and pregnant women. Moroccan authorities retorted that this reflected the fact that the organization was not following the country’s actual efforts in this area, including the settlement of the administrative status of migrants and refugees in Morocco since 2013.  Morocco’s response noted that Amnesty did not pay attention to the adequate and qualitative data presented by Morocco in response to the organization’s 2017 annual report. With regard to abortion and violence against women, the organization should greatly appreciate the adoption of the law on combating violence against women, instead of highlighting cases such as marital rape.  For such cases, Morocco has taken the legislative decision to criminalize all forms of violence against women. As for the report’s comments on abortion, Amnesty did not take into account the evolution of national laws. It failed to mention the draft criminal law regulating the issue of abortion in a way that takes into account all cases adopted in advanced international comparative legislation. On consensual sex and homosexuality, the Moroccan authorities considered that equality and non-discrimination had constitutional status. To protect the psychological and physical well-being of all persons, national laws criminalize all forms of discrimination as well as acts of violence based on sexual orientation and identity. The authorities also said that protection from violence does not prevent the criminalization of sexual relations outside marriage, which is still socially unacceptable. Finally, the Moroccan authorities expressed their regret at the double standards when the report dealt with the human rights situation of Moroccan detainees in Tindouf. Amnesty simply referred to the failure of Polisario to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations committed in the camps in the 1970s and 1980s.  This constitutes blatant ignorance of the daily human rights violations and the tragic and inhuman reality that the inhabitants of the camps are currently facing. Amnesty’s report’s Algeria section was supposed to put its fingers on serious human rights and international law violations in these camps. Unfortunately, Amnesty chose to fire the bulk of its “biased” denunciations on Morocco alone.

Rabat – In a rare product description, the French branch of Funidelia, a popular European costumes and cosmetic products online store, referred to its new costume for children as “costume for child Arab thief.” The image of the advertised costume featured a smiling child model wearing a traditional yellow Saroual pant, an oriental-style wait coast, and a fez. Giving a full Arab connotation to the product, the child model appeared to be holding what looked like a “magic lamp,” an obvious allusion to one of the most popular tales of “Arabian Nights” collection, also known as “The Thousand and One Nights.” ‘Oriental prince’ A customer found the stereotypical product description on February 28. He immediately brought it to the attention of Funidelia France, complaining that the company had been deliberately racist in condoning such stereotypes. “Can someone or perhaps Google explain to us why this pops up when you search for “costume for Arab child thief?” the user asked, referring to the image. Funidelia France called the incident “an unfortunate human error,” quickly changing the description from “Arab child thief” to “Oriental prince.” “The title ‘Child Arab thief’ was changed yesterday. It was clearly an unfortunate human error. We want to apologize to all internet users,” the company tweeted. In another tweet, it thanked the customer who brought up the “mistake.” It replied to the customer’s earlier question, “Thank you for pointing this out. It was an unfortunate mistake that has now been changed.” While the company’s French branch apologized and swore that the whole incident came down to an “unfortunate” mistake that would not be repeated ever again, Funidelia’s main website appeared to suggest otherwise. “Desert thief costume for a child,” reads the description of a similar costume advertisement on the company’s main website. Meanwhile, Funidelia France’s outpouring of apologies were far from convincing, judging from the fury of reactions that followed the company’s responses. “Shame! At this stage and in times like ours, this has nothing of an ‘unfortunate human error.’ It should be called Professional mistake,” one user said. Others were less understanding. In addition to denouncing what looked to them like a deliberate lack of concern for other people’s feelings, they said the company should be boycotted until the person responsible for the description is fired. “Unfortunate human error? Who the hell are you kidding?” one fumed.
The incident comes in heady times for reactionary identity politics in “secular France.” Most recently, Decathlon Group, a global household name for sportswear, was forced to cancel its plans to sell sport hijab in France. No sooner did the company make the announcement of the sport hijab plan than politicians, journalists, and “public intellectuals” caricatured the move. Selling sport hijabs, they argued, is not compatible with France’s Republican and secular values. Pointing out the outsized media coverage of the Decathlon affair and the disproportionate media silence on the “Arab child costume,” a number of internet users resigned themselves to the fact that some factions of the French population will never have the same voice and representativeness in public debate as others.

Rabat – A primary school’s rusty entry door suddenly fell on Thursday, killing a 10-year-old girl and injuring a woman who was also standing near the door. The woman suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized at the Sid Lahsene hospital in Temara. The incident angered the school students’ parents and teachers who protested in front of the school to denounce the school’s condition and the director’s “negligence.”   Parents expressed their outrage over the school’s dilapidated state. They said the school’s lack of facilities, water and sanitation negatively affects students’ health and school experience. One example is that of a student whose father complained about her experiencing burns when urinating, likely infected by a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the school’s unhygienic toilet which is also accessible to the school’s guard dog. The parents complained that there is no cleaner to take care of the school toilets although they pay the parents’ associations fees, collected money supposed to improve the school’s condition. For all the complaints and outrage from parents, however, the ministry of education played down the tragedy, urging the angry parents to resign themselves to divine providence. In a statement released on Friday, the ministry expressed “regret and sadness” over the tragic incident. It added, however, that the schoolgirl’s death “was God’s will.” The statement pointed out that the school’s director met with the girl’s family to convey his condolences and that the ministry has sent a commission to the school to investigate the school’s situation, “take urgent measures,” and ensure that classes resume in normal conditions. In its 2016-2017 annual report, the Moroccan Court of Auditors noted deficits in the basic facilities of some schools.   Running water, electricity, sewage, and hygienic toilets are a rare–sometimes inexistent–commodity in most schools in rural areas, according to the report. Other missing basic infrastructure and facilities include fences, sanitary units, sports fields, multimedia rooms, libraries, internet connection, and teaching materials.

Rabat – Clashes between police and protesters in Algiers have resulted in the injury of  56 police and seven demonstrators, according to Algerian authorities. Algeria is witnessing a wave of protests, the biggest in the country since the Arab Spring.  Hundreds of thousands of Algerians have been marching in all the major cities of Algeria, including Oran, Constantine, Setif, Tizi Ouzou, and Algiers, against their ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s fifth term re-election. Yesterday in Algiers, the police fired teargas and used batons to stop a group of 200 protesters from approaching the presidential palace, 1.5 kilometers away from the protestors’ original gathering spot. Police and demonstrators engaged in violence with some protesters throwing stones.  AFP reported that police arrested 45 people. Carrying Algerian flags and chanting slogans such as “The people want the fall of the regime,” and “Bye bye Bouteflika,” thousands marched down Algiers’ Rue Hassiba Ben Bouali where protests have been banned since 2001. Despite the protests which began last week, the president’s campaign manager, Abdelmalek Sellal, announced on Tuesday that Bouteflika, 81,  would submit his official application to seek re-election for a fifth term on March 3. Algeria will hold its 2019 presidential elections on April 18. Algerians young and old are rejecting Bouteflika’s willingness to extend his 20 years of presidency.

By Badr Hmim It is no surprise that most developed countries owe much of their success to their outstanding school systems. Education has always been at the heart of every progressive or development-based strategy that aims to change lives for the better. The Greeks and Romans realized education’s importance to combat ignorance, so they made the best of it. Likewise, thanks to education, Muslims made huge leaps in various fields, especially medicine, sociology, and algebra—the fruits of which we still reap. A strong education system has become an imperative today in order to guarantee a country’s survival and ability to compete with rapidly growing economies worldwide. Morocco has always considered education to be its second top priority after the Sahara issue, but recent reforms have yielded scanty results compared with the amount of money invested in them and the great deal of importance given to them by media.  Obviously, there is a mismatch between what has been said in the media and what has been achieved so far in the field of education in Morocco. According to the World Economic Forum’s annual report for 2016/2017, Morocco ranked 119th out of 137 countries for quality of education system. The ranking got worse the following year, dropping to 120. This is scary, isn’t it? Are we frighteningly lagging behind? If the rankings are to be considered, our school systems are getting comparatively worse year after year, and this is certainly going to have a pernicious influence on other fields, particularly health and the economy. Where does the problem lie? Has the Ministry of Education been considering these reforms seriously? Why is there not a detailed assessment of the losses and the gains after each reform?  The World Bank report on Education and Training in Morocco, drafted in 1995, showed the frustrating state of Moroccan education. Since then, the education ministry has contended with some serious problems, such as lack of pedagogical content and absence of qualified teachers.  Morocco had to build more schools in rural areas to reduce the number of dropouts. The poor adjustment of schooling to the advanced technologies of the 21st century was one of the most debated issues in the field of education when technology became a must. Inaugurated by the Ministry of Education in 1999 in collaboration with the World Bank, the National Charter for Education and Training sought to fight illiteracy by creating classroom-like settings where adults could learn basic education and teachers could gain highly effective pedagogical tools.  Morocco gave the training of teachers considerable attention by establishing regional training centers for teachers to take one year of training before starting the actual teaching. Linking education to its economic environment was one of the most distinctive features of this reform. As opposed to the previous reforms in the Moroccan education system which were somewhat one-sided, the new education reform was characterized by the participation of all actors including syndicates. This reform was believed to be a comprehensive national project which would change the Moroccan schooling system once and for all because of efforts by both political and civil parties. In the end, however, little progress was made with respect to the quality of education students received. To put it differently, Moroccan schools still do not produce learners with strong critical thinking skills. Some do not even know how to read and write. What would you expect from a student who cannot write his/her name in French after twelve years at school? Worse than this has been the students’ inability to meet the requirements of the labor market. Very few students can compete on a global scale, and those who can are exceptions. Apparently, the 1999 reform has proven to be a complete failure, because it did not bring about any healthy changes to the Moroccan education system but rather made it worse. To compensate for this fiasco, the Ministry of Education introduced the Emergency Plan (2009/2012) which targeted the most essential goals set earlier by the National Charter for Education and Training. A year earlier, this strategic procedure was being prepared and studied by Moroccan and foreign experts, so it set four objectives to be achieved at the end of the plan: Making schooling compulsory until the age of 15, setting a defined program with specific goals, adopting a participative approach to which all the parties will contribute equally, and setting a close follow-up strategy. Morocco launched several projects to put the goals into action. For example, regarding the first goal, more than eight projects were launched, including improving the quality of school life. Despite the efforts and massive funds allocated to accelerate the reforms, the Emergency Plan was no different from the former reforms in the National Charter for Education and Training. Quantitatively speaking, the ratio of children enrolling in school has increased significantly, more schools have been built especially in rural areas, and some schools have gotten access to the internet. Yet, all of this does not matter if the quality of education is still low and unable to achieve excellent ranks globally. This gap between what has been done so far and what is really needed in education today has shown the impracticality of the reforms. Also, it has exposed the ministry’s less organized planning and lack of follow-up.  It seems that this chain of reforms is not going to finish and it has, instead, become a fad among ministry officials. The latest was the strategic vision launched in 2015; it is believed to have injected new blood into education in Morocco. This novel reform has been given 15 years to be put into action, a good indicator that middle and long-term strategies have started to take place. It would be unwise to judge the reform just yet.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The Rewards for Justice Program of the US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service announced on Thursday, February 28, that it would offer a $1 million reward to anyone who has information leading to what it called a “new bin Laden.” It referred to Hamza bin Laden, one of the sons of the former leader of Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden. WANTED. Up to $1 million for information on Hamza bin Laden, an emerging al-Qa’ida leader. Hamza is son of Usama bin Laden and has threatened attacks against the United States and allies. Relocation possible. Submit a tip, get paid. https://t.co/LtBVhsrwTc #RFJ pic.twitter.com/gmx5hkoSzQ — Rewards for Justice (@Rewards4Justice) February 28, 2019  The US Department of State’s Bureau of Counterterrorism also tweeted on Thursday: “Earlier today, the UN’s 1267 Committee designated #HamzabinLaden. As a result of the UN’s action, all member states are required to freeze his assets, comply with a travel ban, and enforce an arms embargo barring the sale or transfer of weapons” The State Department says that Hamza is an “emerging leader.” Bin Laden, the department asserted, posted audio and video messages online back in 2015 asking his followers to join him to “launch an attack against the United States and its Western allies” in retaliation for his father’s death at the hands of US military forces in 2011. It also stated that, according to letters found by Navy Seals in Osama bin Laden’s hideout in in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the senior bin Laden was training his son Hamza to succeed him as a leader of al Qaeda. The State Department noted that bin Laden is married to the daughter of a September 11 hijacker. Michael Evanoff, an assistant secretary for diplomatic security at the State Department, said that Hamza could be somewhere near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The UN Security Council made a press release saying it “approved the addition of [Hamza] to its ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List of individuals and entities subject to the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo.” The Security Council added that Hamza is “seen as the most probable successor of [Ayman] al-Zawahiri,” the current leader of Al Qaeda. Nathan Sales, the US coordinator for counterterrorism, said that Al Qaeda is still a “problem” for the West. He added that it may be taking a “strategic pause” while it “retains both the capacity and the intent to hit us.”

Rabat – The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2019 report published on February 27 ranked Morocco third of Middle Eastern and North African countries in terms of gender equality in law and business. The report assessed gender discrimination in 187 countries and tracked their legal progress in the past decade. In the MENA region, Morocco ranked third, securing 73.13 points out of 100, behind Malta with 91.88 and Israel with 80.63. Tunisia, (58.75), Algeria (57.50), Libya (56.25), and Egypt (50.63) followed. The results were based on a number of indicators, including women’s freedom of movement, laws affecting women’s decisions to enter the labor market, laws affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage gap, and protection from sexual harassment. In September 2018, Morocco’s new Law 103-13 to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination took effect. The law promises prison sentences ranging from one to six months for people who sexually harass women in public spaces. Other indicators included marriage laws, laws affecting women’s work after pregnancy, constraints to women starting and running businesses,  gender differences in property and inheritance law, and laws affecting the size of a woman’s pension. The MENA countries made the least progress in gender equality, with an average increase of just 2.86 points to 47.37 in the past decade. Meanwhile, Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg, and Sweden were the top countries in terms of women’s rights. Kristalina Georgieva, the bank’s interim president, stated: “Gender equality is a critical component of economic growth.” She continued, “Women are half of the world’s population and we have our role to play in creating a more prosperous world. But we won’t succeed in playing it if the laws are holding us back.”

Rabat – After reviewing a series of items and manuscripts from several museums in Morocco, the Ministry of Culture decided has enrolled some into the national list of cultural heritage. To protect the national heritage, the Commission of Restriction and Arrangement of the Culture Sector located antiques from museums and libraries across Morocco and decided to restrict them to the national list of cultural heritage. In a press release, the commission said that it has taken all the necessary administrative and legal procedures. In the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra area, the commission “decided to choose 83 museum pieces located in the National Museum of Oudaya-Rabat and ten pieces of artifacts in the National Museum of History and Civilizations in Rabat.” In the Tangier-Tetouan-Al-Hoceima region, the commission chose 37 artifacts at the Casbah Museum of Mediterranean Cultures in Tangier and five museum pieces in the archaeological museum in Tetouan. The ministry also valued artifacts in the Marrakech-Safi area. “Five artifacts were chosen in Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah Museum in Essaouira, and 10 others in the National Museum of Ceramics in Safi.” The Ministry of Culture has also run several documentation programs, such as establishing an updated database.

Rabat – The Jardin Majorelle Foundation has announced in a press release the sale of Villa Mabrouka, French designer Yves Saint Laurent’s former clifftop haven in Tangier, to English hotelier Jasper Conran. The nonprofit Jardin Majorelle Foundation added that all revenue from the sale would be used for the upkeep of Jardin Majorelle, their Amazigh (Berber) museum, and the Yves Saint Laurent museum as well as serving to create cultural and education programs. While it is not known how much Conran purchased the home for, the New York Times estimated in 2014 that Villa Mabrouka’s value is around $10 million. Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berger purchased Villa Mabrouka, the “House of Luck,” in 1999. Everything Yves Saint Laurent did, he did with artistry and to perfection, and Villa Mabrouka is no exception. However, Villa Mabrouka was distinct from his homes in Marrakech and Paris. Villa Mabrouka was meant to be Saint Laurent’s private place to reflect in his senior years. He collaborated with interior designer Alberto Pinto and garden designer Madison Cox to realize his vision for the villa. Pinto told the New York Times, “For the first time in his life, Yves wanted a restful, open, happy environment — not a treasure palace.” What came to fruition was a combination of traditional Moroccan style and something incredibly fresh, creating a colorful and cheerful haven. Conran has a remarkable eye for design, and this is not his first property purchase in Morocco. In 2016, Conran opened L’Hotel Marrakech in the heart of the ochre city’s medina (old city). His transformation of the 19th-century riad into a decadent boutique hotel has been praised by hotel reviewers and an incredible international array design magazines.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif  Rabat – US President Donald Trump and North Korea Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un ended a two-day summit at the Metropole Hotel in downtown Hanoi abruptly. This second summit between the two leaders was organized to reach an agreement between North Korea and US, through discussing the closure of nuclear production facilities and annulment of sanctions. After Trump and Kim’s brief one-on-one meeting during the first day of the summit, Trump expressed his high hopes: “I feel like the first time was great success, I think this one will be equal or greater than the first.” The first summit was held in June 2018 in Singapore, when the two leaders signed an agreement to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. On Thursday, Kim answered a reporter’s question for the first time ever and reciprocated similar hopes. Asked whether he was “ready to denuclearize,” Kim stated, “If I’m not willing to do that I [wouldn’t] be here right now.” Despite this, the day of negotiations ended in roughly 30 minutes, and Trump returned to his hotel for a press conference two hours earlier than originally planned. The negotiations came to halt after both parties failed to forge a mutual agreement. During the press conference, Trump said “It was about the sanctions…. Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn’t do that.” He asserted that Kim was offering to close the Yongbyon nuclear processing facility, along with additional nuclear production facilities. North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, disputed the claim, stating, “We proposed to remove five sanctions from 11 U.N. sanctions resolutions, specifically ones that impede livelihood of our people.” The United Nations has authorized nearly a dozen international sanctions on North Korea since 2006.  These sanctions restrict North Korea from accessing any equipment that could be used for the development of its nuclear programs as well as limiting the importation of resources, including seafood. Trump stated that, “I could have 100 percent signed something today. We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it was not appropriate.”  Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, explained that Kim was “unprepared” to agree to US demands, but that negotiating teams would resolve their differences in the “days and weeks ahead.”

Rabat – The two-day 46th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) opened on Friday in Abu Dhabi, the UAE. Saudi Arabia is hosting the OIC, headquartered in the kingdom. Ministers and officials representing the OIC member states met Friday at the symposium themed “50 Years of Islamic Cooperation: Road Map for Prosperity and Development,” celebrating the coinciding of CFM with the celebration of OIC’s 50th anniversary. The four-member Moroccan delegation is headed by the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Mounia Boucetta.  The other delegates are Fouad Akhrif, head of the Directorate for the Mashrek, Arabian Gulf, and the Arab and Islamic Organizations at the Moroccan foreign ministry; Abdullah Rabah, permanent representative to the OIC; and Abdul Rahim Muziane, head of the Department of the Islamic Organizations at the same ministry. Morocco decided to reduce the number of its representatives at the event after a month of tension between Morocco and Saudi Arabia over the Western Sahara issue. The Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict issues are at the heart of the meeting. Ministers will discuss developments in Palestine, Islamophobia, terrorism, defamation of religions, the peace process in the Middle East, and the status of Muslims in non-OIC countries. Discussions of economy, trade, agriculture, education, and technology are also within the agenda of the symposium.  Foreign ministers will also address ways to promote science and higher education in OIC countries and curb climate change. Morocco and Saudi Arabia are giving each other the cold shoulder after the North African country was reported to have recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia for consultation in early February. Foreign minister Nasser Bourita denied the news of Morocco recalling its ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, emphasizing that Morocco has its own channels to announce such news if it were true. The spat between the two allies reached a new level after Saudi television channel Al Arabiya aired a controversial documentary about the Western Sahara conflict, claiming that Morocco “occupied” the Western Sahara and presenting Polisario as the “legitimate representative of the Saharawi people.” The report was broadcast a few weeks after Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told Al Jazeera that Morocco’s participation in the Yemen war has “changed” for humanitarian reasons.

Rabat – Mali and Morocco have signed an agreement to harmonize their migration policies, with the two countries vowing to improve migrants’ experience by improving governments’ engagement with migration issues. Yaya Sangare, minister of Malians residing abroad, and Morocco’s Abdelkrim Benatiq, delegate minister for Moroccans resigning abroad, signed the memorandum on Monday in Bamako, Mali. The two representatives said the agreement will improve experience and expertise sharing in terms of migration policies. Bamako and Rabat hope to promote an integrated African policy on migration, from integration to repatriation based on the particularities of each individual case. The overall goal is to improve the human experience of migrants—regarding right to work and the acquisition of legal documents, for example—in receiving countries, and improving living conditions in countries of origin. Also included in the agreement is the need to establish joint measures to provide financial and logistic assistance to NGOs, associations, or civil society groups working for migrants’ welfare in receiving countries. Under the agreement, Morocco, which hosts a considerable number of Malian migrants, including a significant community of students, vowed to ease professional and cultural integration for Malian students at and graduates from Moroccan learning institutions. Citing both Morocco’s migrants’ regularization campaign launched in 2013 and the Global Compact on Migration recently held in Marrakech, Benatiq said that Morocco’s efforts on African and global migration have been considerable in recent years. He said that the North African country has opted for a dignity and rights-based migration policy amid fear mongering and ethno-nationalistic discourses surrounding African and international migrations.

The King awarded the Alawite Wissam (exceptional rank) to Boriana Ivanova Simeonova and the Alawite Wissam of second rank (Commander) to Maria Fernanda Canas.  Foreign minister Nasser Bourita and the King’s chamberlain, Sidi Mohammed El Alaoui, were also among the audience.

Rabat – The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, has discussed all the recent developments regarding his Atlas Lions.  Renard also spoke about the future and Morocco’s friendly game against Argentina this month.  “We are going to have to do the same things as we did against Portugal and Spain at the 2018 World Cup,” said Renard in an interview with CAFOnline. Renard is expecting his Atlas Lions to give the same performances they did during the 2018 World Cup. In the group stage of the World Cup, the Moroccan team played two decisive games against Spain and Portugal.   Moroccans showed determination and high spirit during the two games, even after their unexpected defeat in the first game of the 2018 World Cup against Iran. “If we are at our level, we can compete. While knowing that they have an alien named Lionel Messi who makes everything change. It is an exceptional match in a career and for Morocco. I am sure the players will all be motivated,” the coach said. Renard also talked about Moroccan-Dutch footballer Oussama Idrissi, who recently announced his decision to represent Morocco instead of the Netherlands. “My greatest satisfaction is to have met a very professional player during our last internship. I was impressed by his rigour and his sense of collective spirit,” said Renard of Idrissi. He added that Idrissi’s decision was “very good news.” “It is up to him to impose himself now,” Renard added. Speaking about the Morocco-Malawi qualifier game for the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), Renard said that the game will be an opportunity for field time for “some players who have not worn the national team jersey much.” He added that the game might be also an opportunity to “collect points for the FIFA ranking. It is always difficult to play in Malawi.” The Atlas Lions have already qualified for the continental championship. However, the latest monthly FIFA ranking showed Morocco losing three places, now sitting at 43rd place out of all national football teams, with 1,440 points. Renard still would not bet on Morocco winning CAN 2019. “By showing humility, it’s very difficult to win a CAN and I know what I’m talking about. Statistically, football lovers know that Egypt is a great country.” Renard previously won CAN in 2012 when he was coaching the Zambian national team. He added that he would rather “not be a braggart for Morocco but make the opponents fall on the field.” Renard also expressed gratitude for receiving the Confederation of African Football Coach of the Year Award. “It’s an honor because it is the third time I’ve won it since 2008.”

Rabat – Tunisia has filed a second complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Morocco over the extension of Moroccan anti-dumping measures on Tunisian school exercise books. Tunisia submitted the request to WTO members on February 27, claiming that Morocco violated the 1994 General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, an agreement between many countries to reduce or eliminate customs fees. Tunisia hopes through the consultation to find a satisfactory solution without bringing the dispute before a court. Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun and Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy Moulay Hafid El Alamy signed an agreement last month to extend Moroccan additional fees on the materials for five years, until January 2024. In May 2018, Tunisia filed its first complaint against Morocco when the kingdom imposed additional fees on Tunisian books. The Moroccan government says it levied the tariff to counter the dumping of Tunisian books on the Moroccan market. Following the meeting of the Council of Ministers on July 12, 2018, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said the government’s responsibility “is to defend the national enterprise, which is an employment opportunity and production of national wealth.” In the same statement, El Khalfi explained that the tariff would protect the market and confront dumping, which violates competition rules.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Moroccan Secretary of State in charge of Higher Education and Scientific Research Khalid Samadi at the education ministry, held a working meeting this morning in Rabat with Malaysian Chief Minister of Pulau Pinang Haji Zakiyuddin Bin Abdul Rahman.  The officials’ discussion revolved around widening the horizons of cooperation between Morocco and Malaysia to set up sub-committees and partnerships catering to student and teacher exchange programs and extensive language courses. 

Abdul Rahman stated, “There are centers for Arabic language and Islamic studies in Malaysia but [they] are not as qualified. Therefore, we may need assistance from Morocco in this regard.”  He further stated, “We can help Master’s students from Morocco to pursue their studies in Malaysia, especially in areas such as finance, Islamic banking, etc. And we have a number of institutions that can offer them training courses.”  Omar Halli, the president of Morocco’s Ibn Zohr University, stressed that “Morocco concluded three partnerships in the past with Malaya, Putra, and Sarawak universities that cover a range of majors, from business and Managing, to Finance, to Islamic Studies.”  “We also receive university professors, especially those specializing in Islamic finance who have a high command of both English and Arabic. And we are interested in receiving more.” He also suggested that the Malaysian ministry receive more Moroccans and offer them extensive English language courses.  Samadi noted that “Mohammed V University has relatively the highest number of Malaysian students in Morocco.” The Moroccan panel highlighted how the relationship between the Moroccan and Malaysian governments has in recent years developed markedly in the area of higher education and scientific research based on an agreement in economics, science, and culture that was signed in Rabat in July 2001. The governments confirmed the agreement in a first meeting in Rabat on January 17, 2011.  Besides previous agreements, Morocco’s relationship with Malaysia has grown stronger thanks to the last memorandum of understanding on higher education and scientific research, signed at the last working meeting between a Malaysian secretary of state and Morocco in November 2018. Samadi and Abdul Rahman held the meeting in company of a Malaysian government delegation, the Malaysian ambassador to Morocco, the secretary general of the Moroccan Department of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and Moroccan university presidents and deans.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s political life seems indeed an epic story, flavored with all the dramatic ingredients of ambition, betrayal, plots, and the rise and fall of friends and foes. As the ailing president prepares himself, again, for another presidential race that might culminate in a shocking mandate due to his fragile health, opposition to his candidacy grows as a good number of Algerians cry aloud: “Enough is enough.”  While it is still unclear whether Bouteflika and his entourage will back down from their initial plan of him ruling for another five years, the current events invite us to take a look at how and why Bouteflika became the unmovable “King” in a republic where coups and machinations of the army’s top generals made the stay of his predecessors in the Palace of Mouradia shorter in comparison with his two decades in power. The second man A native of the Moroccan border city of Oujda, the young Abdelaziz Bouteflika found his calling in the Algerian War of Liberation that saw him and some of his peers rise to power after the country’s independence in 1962. Famously known as the “Clan d’Oujda,” in reference to members of the National Liberation Army (ALN) who were based in the eastern Moroccan city, the group was instrumental in seizing power in post-independence Algeria, after a military coup in 1965 led by Colonel Houari Boumediene which overthrew the late President Ahmed Ben Bella. During the 13 years of Boumediene’s rule, Bouteflika was seen as the second man. The charismatic young minister of foreign affairs nurtured ambitions to take his mentor’s place. So when Boumediene died in 1978, Bouteflika saw himself as the natural heir. Falling from grace Bouteflika’s dreams of the presidency were dashed when the leaders of the military opted for the less charismatic Chedli Ben Jdid. Bouteflika’s notorious mismanagement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ budget was invoked for his being sidelined. The fall from grace led him to a self-imposed exile during the 1980s and 1990s in the Gulf countries and France, during which his political career seemed deemed to end.  In 1994, in the midst of a bloody civil war in Algeria between the country’s security apparatus and militant Islamist groups, a conflict in which civilians paid the heaviest price, army generals sought out Bouteflika to assume the presidency. As negotiations failed, General Liamine Zeroual took the job instead and Bouteflika once again went into oblivion, but for a shorter period this time. The prince that was promised Probably sensing that the generals needed him, Bouteflika was able to renegotiate the offer of the military from a strong position. In 1999 the generals once again extended their invitation for him to assume the presidency, and Bouteflika made it clear in his famous statement that he refused to be “three thirds of a president,” indicating that, unlike his predecessors, he would not have less power. Despite the boycott of the presidential elections that year by other candidates who denounced fraud by the government that clearly rallied behind Bouteflika to ensure his win, there was no denying that Bouteflika brought hope to millions of Algerians during the darkest hours of what they call “the Black Decade.” Around 200,000 civilians had died in the years after the military canceled the general elections in 1992 following a sweeping victory by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).  In an effort to end the violence, Bouteflika launched the “Civilian Harmony” initiative, which offered amnesty or reduced prison sentences to members of Islamist militant groups in exchange for giving up their arms.  Many slammed the initiative, accusing the government of not thoroughly investigating applicants’ cases to determine whether they were involved in grave crimes or not. Algerians also argued the government was sparing state agents accused of human rights violations. And yet, the campaign helped to gradually reduce violence in the country. Bouteflika was seen as the man who brought peace to Algeria. Unlimited mandates, mounting pressures As president, Bouteflika solidified his grip on power, eliminating some of the country’s strongest generals who reportedly were against his remaining in the presidency, most notably Mohamed Lamari in 2004 and Mohamed Mediene in 2015.  In October 2008, after nine years in power, Bouteflika only had to change the Constitution to add five more years to his rule. The country’s supreme law limited presidential terms to just two. The amendment granted Bouteflika unlimited terms and was a clear indication of his amassed power during the time he spent in the Mouradia Palace. The return of peace helped the country accumulate huge sums of oil revenues which enabled Bouteflika and the government to keep the situation stable and defuse social tension through programs of housing, employment, and pay raises for public employees. And then came the Arab Spring. While Algeria was not as affected by the wave of pro-democracy protests as neighboring countries, the year 2011 saw Algerian activists take to the streets to ask for reforms and denounce Bouteflika’s rule. The fall of oil prices in 2014 ushered the country into a new period, where economic hardships coupled with a deepening political crisis loomed. Bouteflika’s running for president in the same year while his health deteriorated increased opposition to his rule. Despite his victory, his health problems continued, forcing him to remain absent for the bulk of his fourth mandate.  His absence raised questions about who really rules in Algeria and what that person or those people have in mind as far as the country’s political future is concerned. Embattled, but defiant Prior to Bouteflika’s announcement he would run for a fifth term, the electoral situation was not clear in Algeria. Some observers downplayed the possibility of a fifth campaign due to the president’s collapsing health. They were probably expecting that the state’s top leaders would come to a consensus about another candidate to rule the country for the next five years. Yet, what those political commentators probably overlooked were the statements by some of the political parties’ leaders, including the current Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia. For months, Ouyahia and others reiterated their belief that there was nothing wrong with the president and that he is fit to rule for a new term. The fact that Bouteflika, or at least those around him, pushed for another mandate for the ailing president suggests to some observers that Algeria’s strongmen could not agree on a successor, or at least that they have some plans that they want to enforce while using Bouteflika as a facade.  What the strongmen least expected apparently was how much many Algerians are appalled by such a scenario. The fervor of the last week’s demonstrations in Algeria, in which protesters clearly voiced their rejection of a fifth term for Bouteflika, raises the question of what is the next move for the country’s top decision makers. Will they remain defiant? If so, for how long? Meanwhile, the man who would be King will probably exit the political scene in a far less glorious fashion than he would have probably ever imagined.

Rabat – The continued dominance of French as a foreign language in Morocco angers some Moroccans, who believe that English, if not becoming the dominant language, should at least be on equal footing with French. Although Morocco’s Constitution recognizes only two languages—standard Arabic and Tamazight (Berber)—in daily life many Moroccans speak Darija, the distinct Moroccan dialect of Arabic, and Morocco has a history of using French in official communication as well as increasing interest in using English in educational instruction. Should English replace French? When France established a protectorate in Morocco in 1912 after the signing of the Treaty of Fez, the colonizer imposed French on the Moroccan education system. Since then, French, along with Arabic, have been the two languages used most in business, diplomacy, and government. In January, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said English could not replace French as a language of instruction for at least another 10 years. His comments angered some Moroccans who believe the government should shift its focus towards English. The minister argued that Morocco does not have qualified teachers in English to ensure the success of replacing French. Amzazi, however, did acknowledge that there are more science books available in English than in French. The official’s statement received a counter response from former minister of finance Niar Baraka, who is also the secretary-general of the opposition Al Istiqlal Party. Teaching science in French is a crime During an event in Tetouan, northern Morocco, in February, Baraka said that teaching science in French is “wrong.” He said it is “a crime against students and against Morocco.” Right after independence in 1956, activists called for an end to French teaching and for the Moroccan education system to be entirely Arabized. The country, however, failed to fulfill this objective because there were not enough professors and teachers of Arabic in Morocco. Instead, Morocco hired teachers from other Arab countries, including Syria and Sudan. In 1970, Baraka’s Al Istiqlal opposition party campaigned on the urgent need to Arabize the educational system. “When students reach the baccalaureate, they have [mastered only] primary levels in French. How can we allow a student who doesn’t know the simplest rules of French to become a professor after graduation?” Baraka asked. Baraka also criticized the low level of Moroccan students in Arabic, their mother tongue. Standard Arabic has been used in official government meetings since Moroccan independence in 1956. But Moroccans often use Darija to communicate, even in formal settings, such as classrooms and Parliament. In defense of French The well-known Moroccan researcher Ahmed Assid strongly criticized Baraka’s statements against French. Assid told Morocco World News that Baraka was exaggerating and hypocritical. “We should put an end to the political hypocrisy in our country. The leaders who talk about [the dominance of French] enroll their children in French cultural missions. They don’t teach them the Arabic language,” Assid told MWN. He added that if French is a “crime, then they have to stop committing crimes against their children.” Assid argued that Arabization “failed miserably” and should be ended. He also called for more openness to French for the sake of achieving a higher quality of education. Failure of Moroccan schools: Arabic is not guilty According to Baraka, Arabization is not to blame for the failure of Moroccan schools. “It is wrong to consider the Arabic language responsible for the failure of education in our country,” Baraka said. He emphasized that the failure has other causes like overcrowding and lack of administrative and educational frameworks, as outlined in a recent World Bank report. In response to a question about students’ poor Arabic skills despite Arabization, Baraka said that Arabization “happened very quickly, and the teachers were not well trained to perform their task as required.” ‘We have a real problem in all languages’ For his part, Moroccan author Abderrahim Elalam criticized the low quality of Arabic teaching in Morocco. Elalam told Morocco World News that now even in universities, students struggle to write a correct sentence in Arabic, the mother tongue. “Students now cannot send you a text message in Arabic, they choose Latin letters to message people but in Darija,” Elalam lamented. “In the past, as scholars, we were discussing the content of Ph.D. theses, but now we are discussing how students write their thesis and the language used,” he added. “Even Darija nowadays is lost, most of the people are not able to speak in a classy Darija. We have a real problem in all languages: French, Arabic and English.” Elalam, however, acknowledged that there are some people who are aware of the importance of languages, especially English. Political considerations Elalam also said that English is emerging, especially in language centers and Moroccan universities. Moroccan universities offer three majors in English: Media and cultural studies, literature, and linguistics. English, however, is not offered in state medical schools or engineering schools, although it is offered in some private schools. In the labor market, most companies and public institutions require prospective employees to speak French. Some “elite” Moroccans also prefer to speak in French in both formal and informal situations. At the same time, others see English as the language of globalization and believe it should be given preference over French in Morocco. Both Assid and Elalam agreed with the education minister that if Morocco shifts its foreign language focus from French to English, it would take time. The scholars said that it would be “difficult” for Morocco to shift towards English because France is considered one of Morocco’s most important allies. They noted that language is linked to politics, emphasizing that France supports Morocco’s territorial integrity and several other Moroccan causes. Is Morocco’s second language French or Tamazight? The education ministry rubbed activists the wrong way when it referred to French as a second language in Morocco. Activists have heavily criticized the government and its leader, Saad Eddine El Othmani, for disfavoring Tamazight (Berber). Tamazight is spoken by 30-40 million Amazigh (Berber) people, the majority of whom live in Morocco and Algeria. After independence, Moroccan activists called on the government to include Tamazight in the education system. The 2011 Constitution answered the call, making Tamazight an official language alongside standard Arabic. Al Istiqlal party members have been some of those saying Arabic and Tamazight should be obligatory languages used in public institutions and daily life. According to Assid, their call is in line with the Constitution, and unlike in the past, the party is now calling for more than just Arabization. Al Istiqlal is “now correcting its first position and is acknowledging the Amazigh language as an official language.” Assid said the party “calls for the sole usage of Arabic and Amazigh, but it is against foreign languages,” referring to French. He argued that it should be acceptable for Moroccans to use French if they want to. “Morocco is an independent country, but Moroccans are producing many important things through French,” he argued. Languages: A global question The Moroccan government is not the only cabinet to face pressure regarding the use of languages in education. As just one example, the Netherlands has five official languages: Dutch, Papiamento, Yiddish, English, and Frisian. Other popular languages among the Netherlands’ Muslim population are Arabic and Turkish, according to Amsterdam.info. The Dutch government is also tackling concerns over the widespread use of English crowding out Dutch inside universities in the Netherlands. The BBC wrote in October 2018 that 60 percent of the master’s programs offered at Utrecht University are in English. “At the highest honours level, virtually no courses are taught in Dutch.” It remains to be seen whether the Moroccan government will manage to balance its official languages of Arabic and Tamazight with its foreign options of French and English inside educational institutions.

Rabat – The father of imprisoned political activist Nasser Zefzafi will take part in a public meeting in Lille, France, to discuss the situation of political prisoners in Morocco, on Saturday. The Support Committee for the Hirak Rif in France wrote in a communique obtained by Morocco World News that the meeting would especially focus on Hirak Rif prisoners. According to the statement, the meeting will begin at 6 p.m., at the Bocquet event room in the Hellemmes metro area. Ahmed Zefzafi, the father of Nasser Zefzafi, known as a leader of the Hirak Rif protests that broke out in Morocco in late 2016, spoke despondently in Rabat after his son’s arrest in 2017. At a seminar organized by the National Committee to Support the Hirak Rif in Rabat, Ahmed Zefzafi declared, “Our children are dying in prison, no one cares about them.” “Our children are on a hunger strike and no one cares about them except their families,” Ahmed Zefzafi added. He then asked about the role of political parties and dignitaries in neglecting his son and other activists. Police arrested Nasser Zefzafi on May 29, 2017. On June 26, a Casablanca court sentenced him to 20 years in prison.  Zefzafi’s defense team and rights activists described the sentence as “cruel.” In the appeal hearing of Hirak detainees on January 14, Zefzafi abstained from attending because of what he called the “absence of fair trial conditions.” He announced he would boycott the rest of his appeal hearings. The court has not yet ruled on Zefzafi’s appeal.

Rabat – A new study by the Netherlands’ Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) shows that Dutch people of Moroccan background are among the Dutch demographic groups with a high percentage of weekly contact with their family members. “The study shows that, within the four large non-western groups, around 85 percent of people with a Surinamese, Moroccan, Turkish or Antillean background have weekly contact with family members and around 80 percent have weekly contact with friends.” CBS wrote. More than 84 percent of Dutch people of Moroccan background maintain weekly contacts with relatives and friends. The study added that people of Moroccan background offer more “informal help” than other people of foreign background. According to statistics from 2012-2017, 31.9 percent of Moroccan-Dutch people provide informal help at least once every four weeks. “People with Turkish, Antillean or other non-western backgrounds offer informal help less often than people with Moroccan and Surinamese backgrounds,” the study said. Moroccans are also more active in volunteering than people of Turkish or Surinamese background. According to the 2012-2017 statistics, 41.2 percent of people with Moroccan background volunteer. Another study issued recently by CBS said that the employment rate is high among Moroccan-Dutch citizens in the Netherlands. According to the study, 153,000 Moroccan-Dutch people had paid work in 2018. Of nationals with Turkish migration background, according to the survey, 187,000 people had jobs in 2018. SpringerLink noted that in January 2005, 314,699 people of whom “at least one parent was born in Morocco were living in the Netherlands.”

Rabat – During a press conference in Casablanca on Thursday, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) presented a new study indicating the weak role of Moroccan media in educating children. The study, which consisted of an opinion poll answered by 600 people aged 15 to 34, found that audiovisual media in Morocco dedicates as few as two hours a day to children’s programs and even less to documentaries and educational or cultural shows for children. Moroccan audiovisual channels dedicate approximately 31 percent of their daily content to children, and the content is often programs like cartoons.  UNICEF also noted the absence of child-friendly journalism programs to give young people a voice and put them at the center of content that the Moroccan media publishes, be it cultural, psychological, or educational. As for Moroccan written media, UNICEF emphasized that it unfortunately does not educate new generations or help them develop independent thinking, which is reflected in the lack of articles reserved for children. Based on the information, the survey concluded that Moroccan media “partially fulfills the needs of children and young people in terms of learning.” Moroccan Arabic-speaking newspapers provide more content for children than their French-speaking peers, said UNICEF.  Ironically, journalists who write content about children “do not have enough knowledge about children’s rights,” especially not about children with special needs. Educational programs about children with special needs are also very few. Fewer than 50 percent of Moroccan journalists ask parents for permission before talking to or taking pictures of children, despite the fact that the same journalists agree that children’s rights must be respected.  UNICEF pointed out that the current journalism programs in Morocco do not provide professional training about children’s rights. Still, the study found that there is a growing awareness among Moroccan journalists about the need to respect children’s rights, as some Moroccan media tend to cover or blur children’s faces when reporting about incidents they are featured in.  Some journalists also request permission from the children’s parents before broadcasting photos or videos of them.

Rabat – British police have issued a fresh appeal for a 13-year-old boy, Alex Batty, who was reported missing in 2017 after he did not return from a week-long holiday to Spain with his mother and grandfather.  The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) issued the appeal last month following the boy’s recent 13th birthday. Although they do not believe the boy is in danger, they are attempting to return the boy to his grandmother, Susan Caruana, who is his legal guardian. Caruana believes the abduction occurred because of disagreement over Alex’s care. The grandmother says that the boy’s mother, Melanie Batty, believes in an alternative lifestyle. Caruana told the Telegraph that “the reason I believe they have done this is because basically my lifestyle, my belief systems, are not what they agree with.”  After an investigation in collaboration with Spanish authorities, police believe the trio entered Melilla, the Spanish enclave city bordering Morocco, and may have entered Morocco from there. Caruana said that her daughter had previously taken Alex to visit a commune in Morocco in 2014. Detective Constable Declan O’Reilly of the GMP said in an appeal last year that police are “really concerned because of some of the alternative beliefs held by Melanie.”

He added that “Alex may not be staying in conditions that are suitable for a child of his age. He could be living in a commune or sleeping on the floor.” Although Alex may not be in danger, he may not be having needs met such as “health care, basic check-ups from a GP, vaccinations, dental care.”

Police believe his education is also being harmed, because Melanie does not believe in the mainstream school system. Detective Sergeant Pete Morley added that “he’s obviously been withdrawn from education now since the start of October and we’re getting to a stage where we’re really concerned for this absence from education. It’s going to start having a very long-term impact on Alex’s development.” O’Reilly said in his appeal this year, “The safest place for Alex is back home with his grandmother and we need the public’s help to find and return him to her. She is absolutely desperate for his safe return and when I spoke with her recently she said if there is one thing she could say to Alex it would be for him to please get in touch as his disappearance has left her broken.”

He pleaded for “anyone who has any information, no matter how big or small you think it may be, please come forward so that we can try to reunite a missing boy with his devastated grandmother.”  Alex is described as white, about 5 feet, slim, has blond hair and speaks with a northern British accent.

Rabat – While the banking and financial sectors are generally the most visible in Morocco’s increasingly vocal presence in African affairs, Rabat is turning to education to cement its Africa-focused diplomacy. The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in Morocco and the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), the government body in charge of monitoring government scholarships and study grants, signed a memorandum of understanding yesterday in Rabat to set up a joint scholarship program destined for African students. According to the two bodies, the cooperation dovetails with Morocco’s desire to share its science and technology expertise with the rest of the African continent. Placing the initiative within the Moroccan diplomatic corps’s insistence on South-South and intra-African exchanges, they argued that the memorandum will give an opportunity to many African youth to hone their intellectual skills in Moroccan universities. AMCI’s chief Mohammed Methqal said that IsDB’s willingness to cooperate with AMCI in investing in education is the culmination of the “royal vision which has placed Africa at the heart of Morocco’s diplomacy.” According to the AMCI chief, Morocco is already an assertive promoter of expertise and knowledge sharing at the continental level, and the agreement with IsDB will boost Rabat’s reputation as the top African provider of study grants targeting African students. The goal, he said, is to be at the forefront in the scramble to “train Africa’s future leaders and decision makers.” Since its establishment in 1986, AMCI has been a founding pillar in Morocco’s soft power in the rest of Africa, especially in Francophone countries. But it was after Morocco’s readmission to the African Union that AMCI cemented its impact on continental knowledge-sharing. The body doubled the number of scholarships and study grants for African students. Between 2017 and 2018, Morocco granted over 5,000 scholarships to African students, more than double the number it used to provide. In the same period, junior civil servants from 30 African countries attended Moroccan universities and vocational schools to hone their skills and performance in their areas of expertise. With the newly signed agreement with IsDB, an institution that says that “human resources development lies at the heart” of its agenda, the number of grants and scholarships will greatly increase from 5,000, according to Methqal.

Rabat – The Federation of Cultural and Creative industries (FICC) elected Neila Tazi and Abdelkader Retnani to its head positions on Thursday. The pair were uniques candidate for the positions of president and vice president of the FICC within Morocco’s Employers Association (CGEM). The 153 voters in the elective assembly general of the FICC gathered yesterday at CGEM headquarter to elect Tazi and Retnani. The FICC was created in 2017 but has not opened headquarters while waiting to gather enough members and representatives of the sector. Now a committee Tazi chairs will manage the FICC with the aim of uniting actors to develop the cultural sector and solve funding and skills challenges. The federation now has around 40 members, including production companies, event organizers, publishers, associations, and corporate foundations. The FICC will represent seven sectors: audiovisual arts, cinema, visual and contemporary arts, publishing and bookstores, music, performing arts, and cultural institutions and multidisciplinary spaces. Tazi and Retnani plan to recruit more members and to cover more sectors while focusing on four axes: Working for the public-private partnership (adapted taxation, facilitation of administrative procedures, fight against unfair competition), contribute to structuring the sector (information sharing and communication), improving the place of arts and culture in regional development, and developing human capital (professional training, program redesign). Neila Tazi is the founder and president of A3 Communications, specializing in communication, events, press, and public relations. She was vice president of the CGEM and the Chamber of Councilors from 2015 to 2018 and will be a member of the CGEM parliamentary group until 2021. Abdelkader Retnani is president of the Moroccan Association of Book Professionals (AMPL) and owner of publishing house La Croisee des Chemins in Morocco. He also chaired the Raja Athletic football club of Casablanca from 1985 to 1989.

Rabat – In addition to the topics discussed during Thursday’s government council, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s cabinet also adopted draft Law 14.19 to approve the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. The government council also adopted the Protocol for the Implementation of the Agreement and the related exchange of letters. The protocol is an integral part of the agreement signed by Morocco and the EU on January 14. The government confirmed that the “Moroccan Saharan provinces are an integral part of the national territory where it exercises its full sovereignty as in the rest of the national territory” through the letters exchanged between the two parties, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi told the press after the meeting. El Khalfi said that the agreement is committed to “developing sustainable fishing in the fishing zone on the basis of the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets present in these waters and aims to lay down the framework for a legal, environmental, economic and social governance of fishing activities carried out by the EU fleets.” The agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. It specifies the fishing zones and access conditions for EU vessels and increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual average of €40.0 million to €52.2 million.  In addition to the fisheries agreement, the government council also adopted a draft law to approve an agreement to apply to products from Morocco’s southern provinces at the same tariff preferences as those covered by the EU-Morocco association agreement. The draft Law 10.19 approved the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters on the amendment of draft agreements number 2 and 4 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, concluded on October 25 in Brussels. The agreement establishes an association between the European communities and their member states. El Khalfi said that the first draft agreement concerns the tariffs on products imported to the EU from Morocco, while the second concerns the definition of the concept of “sourced products” and administrative cooperation.

Rabat – Violence erupted at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex in Rabat during the 19th “Clasico” professional football tournament game between rival fans of Casablanca’s Raja Athletic (RCA) football club and the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) club. At the final whistle, FAR won 2-1, but violence marred the victory. Stone-throwing left many with serious injuries, including security forces. Police cracked down on fans and arrested many, especially Raja fans, who flooded into the city in large numbers. Many hooligans reportedly engaged in acts of vandalism, ripping out seats and throwing them onto the pitch, especially in the away stand reserved for Raja fans. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) will likely sanction Raja by making it play its next match without fans. Disorderly behavior has persisted in Moroccan stadiums for several weeks now following an outbreak of violence in Oujda, northeast Morocco. The FRMF’s Central Committee for Discipline and Sportsmanship of imposed tough sanctions for acts of vandalism during the Oriental Derby game between Mouloudia Club of Oujda (MCO) and Nahdat Berkane (RSB) in Oujda. FRMF ordered MCO to play 5 matches without fans and pay an MAD 85,000 fine. RSB was also sanctioned to play 2 matches without fans and pay an MAD 10,000 fine. RSB managers will have to pay the cost of the damage to the city of Oujda. A YouTube video shows Oujda MCO supporters setting fire to seats in the stands while cheerfully shouting their chants.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali plans to host a fundraising dinner that costs more than $175,000 per person, according to the office of the prime minister. Abiy hopes to use proceeds from the dinner as capital to finance the development of infrastructure. The dinner will fund Abiy’s “Beautifying Sheger” project, a three-year project to be executed by Varnero construction company. Rather than rely heavily on foreign loans, Abiy Ahmed plans to fundraise $1 billion from the dinner. The Sheger initiative includes the development of Addis Ababa, the expansion of green spaces, and investment into the green economy. The fundraising dinner is just one of the unique ways that Abiy has raised funds for the development of Ethiopia. In an event in Ambo, 100 kilometers west of Addis Ababa, that raised about $14 million, Ahmed sold his watch for $175,000. Since he came to power in 2018, Abiy Ahmed has taken measures against corruption among members of the country’s previous regime. This drew criticism and led to Abey being targeted in a bomb attack on June 23, 2018, which resulted in two casualties at a rally in support of his government. Among Abiy’s reforms is his willingness to reconcile with Eritrea, which has long had tense relations with Ethiopia. On June 26 last year, Abiy met delegates of Eritrea in the hope of repairing ties between these two nations, after over two decades of animosity. Abiy Ahmed continues to push for wide-scale economic reform in Ethiopia, which the International Monetary Fund considers Africa’s fastest growing economy.

Rabat – “We have an Indian pilot. As a peace gesture, we will release him tomorrow,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said yesterday at a press conference in the capital Islamabad. Prime Minister Khan was referring to wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian pilot whose Mig-21 jet fighter Pakistan shot down earlier this week amid an escalation of tensions over the disputed Kashmir province. Khan, who was debriefing his audience on the state of the ongoing feud with neighboring India, said that his administration is poised to prioritize peaceful resolution over gratuitous military confrontation. He said the Indian pilot would be released today. India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, and many fear a military confrontation could degenerate into an ultimate show of force: The use of their nuclear arsenal. Khan has been calling for negotiations since the current Kashmir crisis broke out in mid-February. “I am saying to India: do not take it further than this. Because whatever you do, Pakistan will be forced to retaliate. And then two countries who have the weapons that the two of us, we should never even think of such a thing,” Khan said in another speech as India prepared to strike “Pakistani targets” with air missiles in retaliation for Varthaman’s capture. In his speech yesterday, Khan also said that he tried to reach Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by phone on Wednesday. “Yesterday, I tried to call Narendra Modi,” Khan announced. “I wanted to make it clear that we do not want any kind of escalation,” he said. Just respecting military ethics In a statement, India’s Air Forces applauded Prime Minister Khan’s “peaceful gesture.” However, India’s statement declined to perceive the move as a genuine peaceful gesture from Pakistan. The statement argued that Islamabad was simply abiding by international norms regarding war ethics. “We are extremely happy to have him back. We want to see him back,” a senior Indian Air Forces officer told reporters in New Delhi. He added, “We only see it as a gesture which is in consonance with all Geneva conventions.” The ongoing crisis erupted on February 14 after 42 Indian Special Forces were killed in a suicide attack in India-administered Kashmir. The attack was later claimed by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Established in 2000, JeM is claiming independence in Muslim-majority Kashmir. India-administered Kashmir is the world’s most militarized territorial dispute, with local militants denouncing India’s “racist” and “discriminatory” policies towards Kashmir’s majority Muslim population. A large section of JeM militants also wants an autonomous Kashmir to join Pakistan. The standoff has generated intense public debate on the decades-long territorial dispute, with a wave of contradictory comments on both Indian and Pakistani social media platforms. Opposing nationalists and “fear mongering” from both countries who call on their leaders to “be tough,” pacifists have pointed out the devastating repercussions of a potential confrontation between two nuclear powers. As India prepares for parliamentary elections in April, it remains to be seen which of the pacifist or the hawkish faction of the country’s ruling party will prevail in dictating India’s response to the tension.

Rabat – Yesterday, King Mohammed VI chaired a working meeting a the Royal Palace of Rabat to discuss programs to upgrade vocational training and improve options and teaching methods. Education and vocational training have been hot topics at the government council’s weekly meetings at the request of King Mohammed VI. In addition to health and social disparities, King Mohammed VI has been calling on Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s cabinet to make more efforts to ensure better education to guarantee students job opportunities after graduation. The King also urged the government to upgrade programs for vocational training, which he believes could increase employment. “Vocational training is a powerful lever for employment, provided  it receives the attention it deserves and as long as it is given a new status as well as a broader scope,” King Mohammed VI said in a speech.  Yesterday, the monarch met with senior officials, including El Othmani. During the meeting, King Mohammed VI asked for a realistic approach that “rigorously sets priorities according to the needs of the national economy and the labor market, and the social expectations and aspirations of Moroccans,” according to a statement from the royal office. The government promised that it is finalizing its vocational training program and it will be “elaborated in accordance with the royal guidelines.” King Mohammed VI tasked a commission with proposing concrete solutions to provide job opportunities for young Moroccans. According to the commission’s statement, it will present its proposal at the next and final meeting. The King ordered the creation of a committee to elaborate specific solutions to curb youth unemployment on October 1. The vocational training project aims to create new training programs for sectors with high economic potential and improve training in more traditional sectors, such as handicrafts or agriculture. The projects are a series of four-month training programs, to assist young people working in the informal sector with enhanced technical and language skills. Four weeks after King Mohammed VI ordered the creation of the commission, El Othmani asked the monarch to give his commission more time to find solutions for unemployment. The unemployment rate remains high among young people aged 15-24, at 27.5 percent. A statement issued this year by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) notes that  Morocco’s overall unemployment rate fell slightly, from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent, from 2017 to 2018. Another recent statement from HCP said that Morocco’s working age population, aged 15 and older, numbered 25,950,000 people in 2018, but the active population of people employed or seeking employment was 11,979,000.  The unemployment rate of those with a vocational training certificate is 23.9 percent: 36.5 percent for women and 19.3 percent for men.

Rabat – Today, March 1, is the 63rd anniversary of the death of a Moroccan teenager who, despite her short life, broke all gender stereotypes and proved to the world and herself that hard work and passion eventually pay off. Touria Chaoui was born in Fez in 1936 to a forward-thinking father, Abdelwahed Chaoui, and mother named Zina. In 1947, when Chaoui was 13, French film director Andre Zwoboda hired her for a role in his film “The Seventh Gate,” at the request of her father, a French-speaking journalist. The director was delighted at Chaoui’s performance. One moment in the movie inspired Chaoui to pursue a dream of becoming an aviator.  In 1950, Chaoui’s ever-supportive father enrolled her into an aviation academy in Tit Mellil near Casablanca, the only aviation school in the country at the time—reserved for the French forces occupying Morocco. The school provided little opportunity for native Moroccans and even less for women. But the school accepted Chaoui’s application in hopes that she would one day give up. When the school itself was expecting her to fail and made attempts to deter her from participating in the aviation program, Chaoui had all the more reason to work hard.  At age 15 Chaoui became a licensed pilot, fulfilling her dream of flying a plane while also becoming the first woman pilot in the Arab world. Upon her success, then Sultan Mohammed V of Morocco gave Chaoui an award at the royal palace. Ever since, Chaoui made headlines in international newspapers and captured the attention of high-ranking personalities.  Becoming a successful Moroccan woman and at a very young age in the 1950s had a price. Some wanted to make Chaoui fail, and some wanted her dead. Common belief is that the French colonizers tried to murder her several times. According to Moroccan historian Abdul Haq Almareni, a French colonizer put a bomb near the door of her villa, but his plan somehow failed. In 1955, two French policemen also shot at Chaoui but their aim was off, said Almareni. On March 1, 1956, Chaoui was preparing to fly her private plane to Saudi Arabia when she was assassinated.  News of Chaoui’s death shocked Moroccans and many in the Arab world who loved and had great aspirations for her. Today, not many know Touria Chaoui’s name, her remarkable confidence and persistence to succeed, or her inspiring yet tragic story.  As the world prepares to celebrate Women’s Day on March 8 and the achievements of women, it is fitting to remember Touria Chaoui’s accomplishments as inspiration for all women who aspire to fly higher than any obstacle.

Rabat – France has awarded three Moroccan personalities the order of knight of the Legion of Honor of the French Republic on Wednesday in Rabat. The recipients are Chief of Protocol to Morocco’s Head of Government Omar Ait Salah; radiologist and social anthropologist Chakib Guessous; and the director of the Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNuR), Khammar Mrabit.  Jean-Francois Girault, the ambassador of France to Morocco, awarded the honors on behalf of the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, at a ceremony attended by prominent political, business, diplomatic, and arts personalities. Girault praised Omar Ait Salah’s contribution to the organization of high-level meetings between Morocco and France, which have been “key spaces for the expression of the rich and diverse exceptional partnership between our two countries.”  He also spoke of Chakib Guessous’s “unfailing commitment” to children’s rights and his concern to move society towards “greater cohesion.” Guessous is a doctor of anthropology and political sociology, radiologist, actor, and author. He focuses on children’s rights, schooling, literacy, poverty, and marginalization.  Guessous wrote “The Exploitation of Innocence” on Moroccan child labor in 2005 and “Marriage and Concubinage in the Arab Countries” in 2018. Girault also remarked on Khammar Mrabit’s commitment to nuclear safety, both within the International Atomic Energy Agency and as the director general of the AMSSNuR. The honorees welcomed the recognition and invoked the common history of Morocco and France. The Legion of Honor, founded in 1802, is France’s highest order of merit. It has approximately 92,000 members, rewarded for their outstanding merits in the service of causes that France defends. The knight of the Legion of Honor is awarded for a minimum of 20 years of public service or 25 years of professional activity and merits. Historically, three Moroccans received the Legion of Honor’s grand cross degree: Muhammad IV, the 19th century sultan of Morocco; T’hami El Glaoui, a pro-French protectorate-era pasha of Marrakech, and Mahamed Tazi, a pasha of Fez.
Rabat – Pope Francis left Morocco on Sunday afternoon, after a two-day official visit, at the invitation of King Mohammed VI. Pope Francis left Morocco through a Royal Air Maroc flight after concluding a papal mass today at the Moulay Abdallah stadium in Rabat. The Pope landed in Morocco on Saturday for his first-ever official trip to Morocco, where he had a busy schedule. Before his departure, the Pope had several activities during which he met priests, migrants, as well as charitable organizations.  The Pope began his second day in Morocco with a visit to a rural Center for Social Services in the town of Mers El-Kheir in Temara, on the outskirts of Rabat. The members of the center run by several Daughters of Charity informed the Pope about the mission of the center and voluntary actions, which provides help  to newborns and children with material and psychological care. Afterwards, the Pope visited Rabat’s cathedral, where he met dozens of Catholic Christians and priests operating in Morocco. The Pope concluded his visit with a mass papal at the Moulay Abdellah stadium attended by thousands of people.

Rabat – On Saturday, Algeria’s powerful National Army chief Gaid Salah reiterated his proposal, emphasizing that the implementation of Article 102 is the only solution that can get Algeria out of the current crisis. According to the army chief, “the position of the army on implementing  [Article 102] remains unchangeable.” In the Algerian constitution, Article 102 stipulates that “whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” Earlier this week, Gaid Salah made a similar statement, calling on Bouteflika to step down. Salah’s statement left many Algerians in shock, as the top army chief is known for his unwavering support for Bouteflika. Some protesters translated Salah’s position as a “circumentive” measure against the demands of protesters. On Friday, thousands of people rallied in Algiers, calling for the immediate resignation of Bouteflika as his fourth mandate is almost expired. Algerian security services faced the protests with tear gas and water cannons to disperse protests against the Algerian government. Protesters demand an overhaul of reforms. Friday marked the sixth week of the protests, which began on February 22 after Bouteflika announced his plans to run for a fifth term.

Rabat – Arab world leaders have reiterated their rejection of the US President’s decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. It annexed the territory in 1981 and has since maintained control over it. During the 30th Arab League summit in Tunis, Arab leaders expressed their full support for the Palestinian cause. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said that “it is unreasonable for the Arab region to continue to be at the forefront of tensions and crisis.” In addition to King Salman, Egypt’s Abdelfattah Al Sissi also condemned the move. Commenting on the decision, King Salman of Saudi Arabia said: “We reiterate our categorical rejection of measures that would undermine Syrian sovereignty over the Golan.” However, political observers said that Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, including UAE, would do little to protect the rights of Palestinians due to their close diplomatic ties with the Trump administration. Political analyst at Qatar University Majed al-Ansari told Al Jazeera that “there is very little intention to come up with very clear outcomes other than the usual discourse of establishing Palestine right and the general Arab stance on regional issues.” On March 28, King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan condemned rejected Trump’s unilateral policies on the Palestinian issue and the occupied Golan Heights.  The two monarchs said Trump’s decision violates international law and reiterated their principled support for Syria’s territorial integrity. The two Kings also reiterated unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Rabat – Pope Francis arrived in Morocco early in the afternoon on Saturday for a two-day visit to Morocco, his first ever trip to the country. The landmark trip aims to promote interfaith, dialogue, and coexistence.  After giving a speech at Hassan tower, the Pope headed to Rabat’s Royal Palace where he and King Mohammed VI signed the “Al-Quds Call,” which aims to preserve the holy city of Palestine, and to safeguard its shared heritage. Pope Francis then posed for a photo with the royal family. The photo shows Pope Francis with Mohammed VI, Prince Moulay El Hassan, Prince Moulay Rachid, and the princesses Lalla Khadija, Lalla Meryem, Lalla Asmae, Lalla Hasnaa, and Lalla Oum Keltoum with her son Prince Moulay Ahmed who is just two years old. The 5 princesses all wore elegant Moroccan kaftans for the occasion, while King Mohammed VI, Prince Moulay El Hassan, and Prince Moulay Rachid, wore traditional jellabas and red fez hats. Kaftans have been one of the key staples of Moroccan culture since the 16th century. The dress, worn by Moroccan women on their wedding day and other special occasions, is often long-sleeved, with buttons and embroidery down the middle and a belt at the waist.  Morocco’s princesses are almost always seen in stunningly intricate kaftans at official events, as is the tradition.

Rabat – Pope Francis arrived at the Cathedral of Rabat on the morning of Sunday, March 31, to cries of “bienvenidos,” “bienvenue,” and “MarHaba” from an elated and international group of priests, church leaders, and consecrated religious people of many denominations. Nuns of the order of Mother Teresa joined Franciscan monks and leaders of Orthodox churches in North Africa. Although the pews were full, the cathedral gathering felt intimate compared to the afternoon mass, where nearly 10,000 worshipers joined the pope at a stadium just outside Rabat.   At the beginning of the meeting, Pope Francis warmly greeted Father Jean-Pierre Schumacher, the last surviving monk of Tibhirine, who is currently living in the Convent of Our Lady of the Atlas in Midelt. Speaking at the cathedral, Pope Francis welcomed the fact that Christians are free to practice their religion in Morocco which fosters the strengthening of dialogue, cooperation and friendship between Muslims and Christians. Pope Francis reiterated his call for interfaith dialogue, a message he delivered a day earlier, speaking with King Mohammed VI. The pope made it clear that such dialogue is not “a strategy for increasing [the church’s] membership.” “Christians are a minority in this country. Yet, to my mind, this is not a problem.” The pope said that proselytizing “leads always to a cul-de-sac,” and that it is Christians’ spiritual and social work that is paramount. “Jesus did not choose us and send us forth to become more numerous! He called us to a mission.” That mission, he said, is not determined by the “number or size of spaces that we occupy, but rather by our capacity to generate change and to awaken wonder and compassion.” The pope explained that “charity, especially towards the vulnerable,” is the best means to build a culture of dialogue. “Dialogue, then, becomes prayer,” he added.  Miguel Angel, a Franciscan monk living in the northern Moroccan city of El Hoceima, told Morocco World News that his monastery runs a center caring for mentally ill people, all of whom are Moroccan Muslims. He practices his religion by helping people in need, he said. “We came to help our brothers. We are interested in the people, not their religion. The person, no matter what they believe, is a child of God.” Seated on the dais, the Pope was flanked on either side by Morocco’s two archbishops, Father Cristóbal Lopez Romero of Rabat and Father Santiago Agrelo Martinez of Tangier. “I would like all Christians and Muslims around the world to know that we are brothers and not rivals, and we are working together in the land of Morocco to build a world of justice and peace,” Archbishop of Tangier, Santiago Agrelo Martínez, told reporters. Most of those in the cathedral were elders, reflecting the aging population of the Catholics in Europe. But at the end of the ceremony, four children ran up to greet the pope on stage, to laughter and cheers from the audience.   Most of Morocco’s current Christians are young immigrants from sub-Saharan African countries. Omar, a young Protestant from Niger studying in Rabat, saw the pope’s visit as helping Morocco’s Christian minority. “It shows us that there is really a freedom of worship, for us, being foreigners in this country.” Read Also: Papal Visit: Majority of Christians in Morocco Come From Sub-Saharan Africa

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has said that he is the “Guarantor of the free practice of religion” in a speech given to celebrate Pope Francis’ first visit to Morocco on Saturday. Peace, tolerance, and coexistence between the three Abrahamic religions were the focus of the King’s speech delivered at the Hassan mosque plaza in front of hundreds of attendees. The speech is part of the celebration for Pope Francis’ first visit in history to Morocco. In his address, the King emphasized the freedom to practice all religions in his country. “I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco,” said the King in his speech. The monarch, who delivered his speech in four languages, said that he is the  Commander of all believers. “And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom,” added the monarch. The King conveyed Morocco’s penchant for coexistence, which honors the tradition of mutual understanding and moderation between all religions. The monarch also stressed that Morocco’s principles and tolerance are against all forms of indifference. “I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” said the monarch. US International Religious Freedom report in 2017 said the number of Christians living in the major-Muslim country is ranging between 2,000 to 6,000 Christians. Other NGOs estimate that the number might be higher. The French arm of the Dutch Open Doors NGO said that the number of Christians living in Morocco is 32,000. In addition to Christians, 2,000 Jews live in Morocco,  estimated the Jewish Agency in 2018. In a message addressed to the UN General Assembly in September 2018, King Mohammed VI emphasized that Morocco is a land of all religions, emphasizing the presence of multiculturalism and peaceful relations between people of different faiths in the North African country. “Morocco, where Arab-Islamic, African and Judeo-Christian civilizations have long mingled, honors an immutable tradition of moderation, coexistence and mutual understanding,” the King said.

Rabat – Arlene Urmunita spent the first half of her Sunday morning on the phone coordinating a family reunion. She was indicating to apparently lost relatives the right place to meet before the historic papal mass in Rabat. “I’m at the main entrance, where are you?” Urmunita told a relative on phone.  As Urmunita spoke, a flurry of people crowded around her, hustling to get inside the venue of the mass. On an occasion such as what Rabat was witnessing on Sunday, March 31, getting a seat with panoramic view of the mass — and of course a better view of the pope — came with grueling efforts. Urmunita’s vicinity was bustling with people, speaking flusteredly into her phone her voice was barely audible. “No, that’s not the right place. That’s the pope’s entrance,” she told her relatives. Urmunita, 41, is a practicing Catholic working in Rabat as a nanny. She is originally from the Philippines. Every Sunday, Urminita attends mass Rabat’s St. Peter’s Cathedral with four of her family members. For the papal mass, the Rabat cathedral distributed free tickets to all its members. Urmunita and her four family members received a ticket each. The orange caption on each ticket, “for the faithful,” came with a combined sense of joy and achievement. It meant the family’s routine, attending every Sunday mass, was being rewarded with the most gratifying trophy many Roman Catholic would pray for: Celebrating mass in the “holy presence” of the pope, also known as the “the father of all believers.” The pope’s second and final day began in the city of Temara, southwest of Rabat, where he visited the Rural Center for Social Services. He then proceeded to St. Peter’s Cathedral to give a speech to the dozens of religious leaders and supporters that filled the pews. During his speech, Pope Francis saluted the freedom of religious practice that Christians enjoy in Morocco. That Christians could freely attend to their religious duty in Morocco, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, spoke volumes about the possibility of peaceful interfaith relations, the pope said. The Christian community in Morocco is approximately 2,000 to 5,000 people. It is estimated that 99 percent of Morocco’s population of 34 million is Muslim. In his speeches during his two-day stay in Morocco, he indefatigably spoke about strengthening dialogue, cooperation, and friendship between Muslims and Christians. But the pontiff also noted the need for Morocco’s Christians to prioritize spiritual and social work over proselytizing, which is illegal in Morocco.  “Jesus did not choose and send us forth to become more numerous. He called us to a mission,” Pope Francis said. That mission, he elaborated, is not determined by “the number or size of spaces that we occupy, by rather by our capacity to generate change and awaken wonder and compassion.” Following his speech, Pope Francis had lunch with priests and the Council of Churches before departing to hold mass for Urmunita and the thousands that had already began to hustle their way into the Prince Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex. “It was so important to us to see the pope and we are so blessed to be here,” Urmunita told Morocco World News. “This visit will change the attitude of the people. Seeing the king and the pope meet will strengthen the friendship between Muslims and Christians in Morocco.” The mass was the final — and culminating — event of Pope Francis’s two-day trip to Morocco. The pope’s Moroccan stay placed an emphatic focus on interfaith dialogue and issues of migration. On the first day of his visit, Pope Francis visited organizations and institutions working on those issues, the Mohammed VI center for Islamic studies and the Caritas migration center. After saying mass, the pope drove to the Rabat-Sale Airport for his farewell ceremony before flying back to Rome onboard a Royal Air Maroc flight. “We are all sad to see the pope leave, we will miss him very much here in Morocco,” Urmunita said. Pope Francis’s next international visit will be to Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from May 5-7.

Rabat – Morocco’s Philharmonic Orchestra prepared a special performance to celebrate Pope Francis’ visit in Morocco at the request of King Mohammed VI. During the spiritual moment, three people representing the three Abrahamic religions stood in front of King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis to perform religious songs from Muslim, Christian, and Hebrew traditions. The performance began with the sound of double bass and the Islamic call to prayer (addhan) performed by the muezzin Smahi El Hadni, who wore a green Djellaba and a white cape.  Wearing a fabulous green caftan, French singer Francois Atlan chanted the Jewish prayer known as Adonai, followed by El Hadni. The soprano singer, who is also the daughter of orchestra chief Jean-Claude Casadesus, Carlone Casesus joined the theater to chant Caccini’s motet Ave Maria. The performance amazed the crowd, who attended the ceremony held at the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates (Islamic counselors). King Mohammed VI was accompanied by the Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan and  his brother Prince Moulay Rachid. During the reception, the King and his guest watched an film  made by the institue on its goals, missions, and various achievements. The Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq also gave a speech before the two leaders, emphasizing that  King Mohammed VI has put in place reforms and introduced a dynamic of concordance between the modern institutional frameworks and the purposes of religion in different aspects. During the ceremony, two students from the Mohammed VI institute shared their experiences in the institution. Aboubakr Hmaidouch, a French student of North African origin, pointed out that the Muslim community in France is in great need of imams and preachers. The values of religion, he said, contribute to living together and to spiritual well-being in society. After the terrorist attacks that struck France in 2015, Hamaidouch said he felt the need to “acquire knowledge and communication skills” to be effective in a “society shaped by multiple currents and sometimes by ready-made ideas. “The papal visit is part of a landmark trip to emphasize the importance of coexistence between the Abrahamic religions. Both King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis delivered speeches on the importance of inter-religious dialogue and coexistence. In his speech, King Mohammd VI said that he is keen to “ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom.” He added “I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco.”

Rabat – A teenage boy ran at King Mohammed VI’s car after the arrival of Pope Francis in Morocco on Saturday. The boy ran at King Mohammed VI as he was standing up in an open-topped car to wave at crowds in Rabat. King Mohammed VI’s security guards were quick to intervene and stop the man from reaching the King’s car. Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) said that the man who intervened the royal protocol is a minor.  The statement published by MAP said that the 17-year old minor lives in Sale. He was attempting to approach the King to complain about the health issues of his parents. Pope Francis arrived in Morocco on Saturday. Both King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis delivered speeches emphasizing the importance of interfaith dialogue and coexistence between the three Abrahamic religions. This is not the first time someone has broken royal protocol in Morocco as several other people have done the same at several events across Morocco.

Rabat – The Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf said that Arab countries must remain united in the face of global challenges, at a meeting of the Arab League Executive Council on March 30 in Tunis. The threat posed by Iran is the biggest challenge for the Arabs, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Assaf said Friday. “One of the most dangerous forms of terrorism and extremism is what Iran’s… blatant interference in Arab affairs and its militias… the Revolutionary Guards in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, who require us to work together,” he said. Al-Assaf also spoke about his county’s “balanced relations and contacts on the international scene.” Saudi Arabia “coordinates positions with Arab countries to positively influence the causes of the Arab world on the international stage,” the Saudi Press Agency quoted Al-Assaf as saying. Al-Assaf said that Saudi Arabia supports the Skhirat agreement, signed in December 2015. The agreement is “a road map for the political solution to the Libyan crisis”, he said. On March 26, King Salman received Marshal Khalifa Haftar on a two-day visit to Riyadh. Haftar had announced, in December 2017, the “end” of the Skhirat agreement which provided for the formation of the Government of National Unity. According to Haftar, “All the bodies stemming from this agreement lost their legitimacy.” On March 28, Rabat sent an indirect message to Riyadh about the situation in Libya. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that coordination between allies should be “two-way. It should not be on demand. It should cover all the important issues in the Middle East as in North Africa, like the Libyan crisis.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI of Morocco amazed the world as he shared his thoughts and beliefs on religious peace, tolerance, and coexistence in four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish. At the Hassan mosque plaza on Saturday, King Mohammed VI  began his speech in Arabic, emphasizing that it was an exceptional day in Morocco for two reasons. “It is exceptional because of the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis. It is also exceptional because it reminds me of the historical visit the late Pope John Paul II paid to Morocco,” said the King. In fluent Spanish, King Mohammed VI spoke about coexistence and the “exceptional” rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. “It is reflected by the mosques, churches, and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom since time immemorial.” King Mohammed VI received respect and applause from the attendees for his decision to convey words of tolerance and peace in four different languages. In English, the monarch called on interfaith dialogue between the three Abrahamic religions, which “were not created to be tolerant of one another out of some unavoidable fate, or out of courtesy to one another,” according to the King.  The King concluded his speech in French, emphasizing that “spirituality is not an end in itself. Our faith translates into concrete actions. It teaches us to love our fellow human beings and to help them.” Pope Francis arrived in Morocco on Saturday for his first ever official visit in Morocco. King Mohammed VI, accompanied by Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, and Prince Moulay Rachid, received the pope. The Pope’s second day in Morocco has a busy schedule. The Pope will start his day by visiting the Center for Social Services in Temara, a city near Rabat. The Pope will then meet with religious men and women in Rabat’s cathedral. Before heading back to the Vatican, Pope Francis will celebrate the Catholic mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium in Rabat.

By Sebastian Bouknight Rabat – Eight hundred years earlier, St. Francis of Assisi had wished to visit Morocco’s sultan but could not, due to illness. His ambition, Toufiq explained, illustrates that the Vatican has known for centuries that Morocco is the seat of the Amir al-Muminin, or Commander of the Faithful. The visit of Pope Francis—who adopted the saint’s name upon his inauguration in 2013—brought this ambition to fruition. King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s current Commander of the Faithful, invited the pope to reinvigorate “interfaith dialogue, mutual understanding between the faithful of the two religions, and [promote] the values of peace and tolerance.” Visiting the Institute The two religious leaders visited the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Preachers. On the shining marble floor of the entry hall, hundreds of student imams waited to enter the lecture hall. The crowd showed the institute’s reach: Chadian students dressed in all white, students from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal in a brilliant array of colors. Of the institute’s 3,000 male and female students, nearly half are foreign, mostly from West African countries. Standing below the intricately carved, arched ceiling, Hassan, a student imam from Côte d’Ivoire, told Morocco World News the pope’s visit was a welcome confirmation that “Christians and Muslims are all brothers, all human beings.” Interfaith dialogue is vital to his home country, he explained. “Most of my friends are Christian. Even in the same family, you can find Muslims and Christians.” Like all of his international classmates, Hassan will return home after his two-year program to guide his community with the inclusive Islamic teachings learned in Morocco. Protecting Against Extremism After arriving, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI sat beside each other in elegant red and gold chairs, facing the stage, to watch a promotional video for the institute, shown in Spanish for the Argentinean Holy Father. King Mohammed VI founded the institute in 2014 to build for the Muslim world a scholarly buttress against the dangers of extremist ideology. By promoting Morocco’s inclusive, spiritual interpretation of Islam, Minister Toufiq explained, the institute helps to protect the religion. Two foreign students addressed the monarchs, the audience of students, the papal entourage and leaders of Morocco’s government. Both had sought the institute’s Islamic education in order to combat extremism back home. The violence of extremist group Boko Haram sparked Hind Usman, a young woman from northeastern Nigeria, to leave her work as a microbiologist to study Islam in Morocco. Extremism preys on religious people who are moved by “passion rather than knowledge,” she said. Usman hopes to return home and educate her community against manipulation and “influence tolerance, love, and peaceful coexistence between Muslims, Christians,” and those of other faiths. Likewise, the 2015 terrorist attacks in France spurred Aboubakr Hmaidouch, a French student imam and industrial designer to study in Morocco. “I knew that these crimes were against religion,” he said, and “realized that there was a need for voices to speak up . . . against this ideology of death.” A Musical Message of Unity After these students spoke, the curtains opened to an orchestra. An imam, chanting the Muslim call to prayer, walked onto the stage as cellos droned. As the orchestra swelled, a Jewish woman singing a Hebrew prayer and a Christian woman singing the Ave Maria joined him. The musical mélange, a clear message of unity between believers of the three Abrahamic faiths, moved the two holy leaders. After thanking the musicians and the students, the king and pope left the institute to dine together in the Royal Palace. Today, March 31, Pope Francis will preside over a Catholic Mass at the Prince Moulay Abdellah sports complex at 2:45 p.m.

Rabat – A Moroccan Ambassador has said in a statement that terrorism has little to do with religion and a lot more with the social system.  The Moroccan Ambassador to Italy, Hassan Abou Ayoub, has stated that Morocco combats radicalism and terrorism through an integrated approach of security and education that has borne fruits beyond Moroccan borders. Speaking at a seminar on “the future of extremism in the countries of the Maghreb,” Ayoub said that the success story of Morocco’s “unique efforts” to curb extremism lies in its attempt to promote an alternative religious rhetoric at mosques.  Religious Reforms as a counter-terrorism strategy “This is achieved through training Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates (religious guides) in countries that are victims of extremism, notbaly Africa, Sahel and, Europe,” the ambassador noted, referring to the multiple reforms that Rabat has initiated in recent years to emerge as its region’s bulwark of counter-extremism. Morocco’s counter-terrorism strategy has been deployed on targets three main fronts: stepping up internal security, eradicating poverty, and spearheading religious reforms.  On the religious front, Morocco has especially invested in promoting values of moderation and tolerance both domestically and abroad through education programs, community building, and religious training. In 2015, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates. The institute has since been dedicated to the training of Imams from the African continent and Europe.  It has been touted for cultivating values of tolerance and coexistence. The institute is part of a broader Moroccan plan to stand up to all forms of religious extremism. But the institution also seeks to preserve  the spiritual identity of Moroccans. According to Ambassador Hassan Abou Ayoub, “Morocco intends to to propagate moderate values of Islam to combat the proliferation of radical ideologies.” Since the terrorist attack in Casablanca on May 16, 2003, the deadliest terrorist attack in Morocco’s history, Morocco has undertaken to implement vigilant security measures to combat Islamic radicalism.  The approach, Ayoub elaborated, has proved effective l and has had tangible impacts beyond Morocco. “Many countries like England, Belgium, and Germany, have benefited from it.”  Vision and effective social policies King Mohammed VI’s “clear vision” has anticipated events differently from the usual approach of “ emergency treatment, which is inappropriate,” he continued. Pointing out that the proliferation of extremism is mostly due to the social system, the Moroccan ambassador said that “Europe has made mistakes by failing to give priority to Africa in the face of problems relating to development … Poverty drives people to turn to extremisms.” But Ayoub regretted that European countries still lack a unified counter-terrorism strategy because of big political differences.”  Meanwhile, he concluded, Morocco has been an invaluable EU ally on security and extremism related issues. “Morocco’s outstanding counter-terrorism policy have benefitted many European countries like Germany, England, and Belgium.” The ambassador’s comments tune with King Mohammed VI’s repeated insistence on enlightened and responsible leadership to meet the challenges facing Morocco and the world today.  In his welcoming speech on the occasion of Pope Francis’ ongoing visit to Morocco, the King reiterated his belief that right leaders and good religious education can prevail as the world pains to come to terms with the instrumentalization of religions. “As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” the King said.

Rabat – The Drummondville Economic Development Authority (SDED) will visit Morocco and Tunisia in April, in a bid to recruit skilled and semi-skilled workers. The mission will bring together a dozen companies with an offer of 120 job positions, from chefs,machinists and sheet metal workers, to web developers and programmer-analysts. The SDED and six of the Drummondville companies will travel to Casablanca, Morocco, from April 15-19, on a pilot mission organized by the Quebec Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion. They will join a group of 22 companies from across Quebec. The companies will meet pre-selected Moroccan candidates to fill the vacant positions.  The mission is part of the Quebec regional government’s plan to help overcome the region’s labour shortage. Read Also: World Bank Gives Morocco MAD 700 Million Loan to Counter Unemployment The SDED is a team of experts dedicated to the economic development of the Drummond county. The project’s partner members include 500 public companies from various sectors, including trade, industry, tourism, business, and community services. According to Canada’s 2016 census, immigrants make up 2.9 percent of the population of Drummond county. The rate is much lower than the regional level in Quebec which seats at 13.7 percent. Montreal and Casablanca are connected with two daily non-stop flights, operated by Air Canada and Royal Air Maroc. As their bilateral ties expand and touch numerous sectors, Morocco and Quebec plan to set up direct flights between Moroccan cities and the Canadian region.

Rabat – In a speech delivered at the Esplanade of the Hassan Mosque on the occasion of the official visit of his holiness Pope Francis to Morocco, the Sovereign underlined the importance of education to tackle radicalism. The three Abrahamic religions, according to the King, were created “to open up to one another and to know one another.” Religions offers venues to fight against radicalism through knowing one another, which will help rise to the challenges of our tormented times through education, King Mohammed VI. “To tackle radicalism, the solution is neither military nor financial; that solution has but one name: Education,” the monarch said. He noted that in the face of ideology-linked violence and extremism prevailing in many parts of the world today, “it is clear the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions is insufficient.” The Moroccan monarch pleaded for rethinking the role of education in the struggle against extremism. In his view, ignorance, or erroneous interpretation of the peaceful and humanity-celebrating messages of religions, is the primary source of many of the problems facing the world. He said, “My plea for education is an indictment of ignorance. It is binary conceptions and the fact of not knowing one another well enough that are threatening our civilizations; it is certainly not religion.” When taught, understood, and practiced as recommended in the Scriptures, religion can be a source of blossoming relations between people and countries, King Mohammed VI suggested, Sovereign pointing out that what all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. He said they instrumentalize religion and rob its purpose of spreading peace and mutual understanding. Religion, the King noted, is Light, Knowledge, Wisdom and Peace, and it should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people using it to spread ignorance and  intolerance. “That is why, as Commander of the Faithful, I am advocating today that we give back to religion its rightful place in education,” the King said. Pope Francis’s visit is taking place at a time when the Community of Nations – just like that of all Believers – is facing a number of challenges. And to rise up to such crises, the King said, “we need to tackle these new ills which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the Divine Message by advocating the denial of the Other and similar wicked theories.” In a world in search of direction, the Kingdom of Morocco has never stopped proclaiming, teaching and experiencing, on a daily basis, Brotherhood among the Sons of Abraham, the Sovereign stressed, adding that this is a founding pillar of the exceptionally rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. The symbiotic relationship uniting Moroccans – beyond their faiths – is an eloquent example in this regard, according to the King. He underlined that the symbiosis is a reality in everyday life in Morocco, and is reflected by the mosques, churches, and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom for centuries. “As King of Morocco and Commander of the Faithful, I am the Guarantor of the free practice of religion. I am Commander of all believers.” And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practice the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom. I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco,” the King said. Security and peace have been Morocco’s distinctive marks in a region mostly associated with socio-economic crises and political strife. Part of Morocco’s successful security architecture comes down to the series of reforms the King launched since 2015 to reinforce Morocco’s position as a fortress against extremist discourses. King Mohammed VI particularly recalled the setting up of the Mohammed VI Ulema Foundation and the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams as well as male and female religious guides. Over the years, the institute has received young people from several European and African countries. It has been touted as the nest of a new generation of imams, versed in subjects as diverse as philosophy, theology, and psychology, but also equipped to deal with the complexities of the modern world. King Mohammed VI said that his meeting with his holiness Pope Francis attests to a mutually held belief that the values of monotheism contribute to rationalization, to reconciliation and to improving the world order. “As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time,” the monarch underlined. The Sovereign also said that he has been following with interest and appreciation the efforts made by his holiness to serve peace in the world, as well as his regular calls to promote education and dialogue, to end violence, to combat poverty and corruption, to tackle climate change – to fight the ills plaguing human societies. “Our messages do not concern our time only; they are eternal. They call upon people to embrace the values of moderation, to fulfil the imperatives of knowing one another and to raise awareness of otherness,” the King pointed out.

By Sarah Goodman &amp; Sebastian Bouknight “We had a month of perfect sunshine, until today,” remarked a Moroccan woman under an umbrella awaiting King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis II on Saturday, March 30 at the Tour Hassan Mausoleum. It was a testament to the power of faith that the weather did not deter the men and women who dutifully waited for hours in the rain for the chance to see the leaders, both of whom serve as political and religious heads of state. During Pope Francis visit to Morocco, the crowd awaiting the motorcade stood with umbrellas, crouched under plastic tarps, shielded themselves with seat cushions, or stood stoically in the rain. A convoy carrying the two monarchs made its way through the streets of Rabat to the Royal Palace; the flags of Morocco and the Vatican fluttered above the roadways and from the mausoleum flagpoles. Security was tight, and guests filed through metal detectors before entering the walled enclave. Equally dutiful onlookers—many were Moroccans who arrived in the morning on a series of buses—packed the sidewalks or watched from awnings on the streets opposite. Mohammed VI spoke first, espousing tolerance and dialogue between “the three Abrahamic religions.” “The reason they exist is to open up to one another and to know one another, so as to do good to one another.” Speaking at different points in Spanish, Arabic, English, and French, the King decried what he referred to as “the phenomena of radicalization.” “What all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. Today, religion should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people, for ignorance or for intolerance.” Pope Francis, addressing the expectant listeners, corroborated the King’s vision, denouncing extremism a negation of religion rather than an expression of it: “[extremism] is an offense against religion and against God himself.” The mood felt expectant, even celebratory: choruses of ululating and choir hymns were both audible over from the people assembled. Morocco is a Muslim-majority nation and many of the country’s Catholics are from other parts of Africa or the world.  Speaking to Morocco World News, a young Catholic woman from Guinea-Bissau shared that she was “very happy,” despite the cold and wet. Shuffling her feet to keep warm, she animatedly shared that she lives in Marrakech and made the trip for the purpose of seeing and hearing the pope speak. This sentiment was echoed by another woman from Burundi, who said in an interview that it was an unexpected “pleasure” to hear the pope, an experience she had not expected to have during her two years in Morocco. The pope later made a visit to the offices of Caritas, a Catholic charitable organization, to discuss the plight of migrants in Morocco.

Rabat – Pope Francis delivered Saturday in Rabat a speech at the official welcome ceremony held in his honor at the Esplanade of the Hassan Mosque, which was chaired by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Commander of the Faithful. Here follows the official translation of the speech: “Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highnesses,
Distinguished Authorities of the Kingdom of Morocco,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Dear Friends,
As-Salam Alaikum! I am pleased to set foot in this country so filled with natural beauty, while at the same time preserving the traces of ancient civilizations and bearing witness to a long and fascinating history. Before all else, I would like to express my deep gratitude to His Majesty King Mohammed VI for his kind invitation, for the warm welcome which he has given me in the name of the entire Moroccan people, and, in particular, for his gracious introduction. This visit is for me an occasion of joy and gratitude, for it allows me to see at first hand the richness of your land, your people and your traditions. I am also grateful that my visit offers a significant opportunity for advancing inter-religious dialogue and mutual understanding among the followers of our two religions, as we commemorate – at a distance of eight centuries – the historic meeting between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al-Kamil. That prophetic event shows that the courage to encounter one another and extend a hand of friendship is a pathway of peace and harmony for humanity, whereas extremism and hatred cause division and destruction. It is my hope that our mutual esteem, respect and cooperation will help strengthen the bonds of sincere friendship, and enable our communities to prepare a better future for coming generations. In this land, a natural bridge between Africa and Europe, I would like to affirm once more our need for cooperation in giving new impetus to the building of a world of greater solidarity, marked by honest, courageous and indispensable efforts to promote a dialogue respectful of the richness and distinctiveness of each people and every individual. All of us are called to rise to this challenge, especially at the present time, when our differences and our lack of reciprocal knowledge risk being exploited as a cause for conflict and division. If we wish, then, to share in the building a society that is open, fraternal and respectful of differences, it is vital to foster the culture of dialogue and adhere to it unfailingly, to adopt mutual cooperation as our code of conduct and reciprocal understanding as our method and standard. We are called to pursue this path tirelessly, in the effort to help each other overcome tensions and misunderstandings, clichés and stereotypes that generate fear and opposition. In this way, we will encourage the growth of a fruitful and respectful spirit of cooperation. It is likewise essential that fanaticism and extremism be countered by solidarity on the part of all believers, grounded in the lofty shared values that inspire our actions. For this reason, I am happy that I will shortly visit the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates. Established by Your Majesty, the Institute seeks to provide effective and sound training to combat all forms of extremism, which so often lead to violence and terrorism, and which, in any event, constitute an offense against religion and against God himself. We know how important it is to provide a suitable preparation for future religious leaders, if we wish to awaken a genuinely religious spirit in the heart of future generations. Authentic dialogue, then, makes us appreciate more fully the importance of religion for building bridges between people and successfully meeting the challenges that I mentioned above. While respecting our differences, faith in God leads us to acknowledge the eminent dignity of each human being, as well as his or her inalienable rights. We believe that God created human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity, and he calls them to live as brothers and sisters and to spread the values of goodness, love and peace. That is why freedom of conscience and religious freedom – which is not limited to freedom of worship alone, but allows all to live in accordance with their religious convictions – are inseparably linked to human dignity. In this regard, there is a constant need to progress beyond mere tolerance to respect and esteem for others. This entails encountering and accepting others in their distinctive religious beliefs and enriching one another through our diversity, in a relationship marked by good will and by the pursuit of ways we can work together.
Understood in this way, creating bridges between people – from the point of view of interreligious dialogue – calls for a spirit of mutual regard, friendship and indeed fraternity. The International Conference on the rights of religious minorities in Muslim countries, held in Marrakech in January 2016, addressed this issue, and I am pleased to note that it condemned, in effect, any exploitation of religion as a means of discriminating against or attacking others. It also stressed the need to move beyond the concept of religious minority in favor of that of citizenship and the recognition of the value of the person, which must have a central place in every legal system. I also see as a prophetic sign the creation in 2012 of the Al Mowafaqa Ecumenical Institute in Rabat. The Institute, an initiative of Catholics and other Christian denominations in Morocco, seeks to help promote ecumenism, as well as dialogue with culture and with Islam. This praiseworthy undertaking manifests the concern and the desire of the Christians living in this country to build bridges as a means of expressing and serving human fraternity. All these are ways to halt the misuse of religion to incite hatred, violence, extremism and blind fanaticism, and the invocation of the name of God to justify acts of murder, exile, terrorism and oppression. The genuine dialogue we want to encourage also leads to a consideration of the world in which we live, our common home. The International Conference on Climate Change, COP 22, also held here in Morocco, once more demonstrated that many nations are conscious of the need to protect this planet where God has placed us to live and to contribute to a true ecological conversion for the sake of integral human development. I express my appreciation for the progress being made in this area and I am gratified by the growth of authentic solidarity between nations and peoples in the effort to find just and lasting solutions to the scourges that threaten our common home and the very survival of the human family. Only together, in patient, judicious, candid and sincere dialogue, can we hope to devise adequate solutions for reversing the trend of global warming and to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty. Similarly, today’s grave migration crisis represents an urgent summons for concrete actions aimed at eliminating the causes that force many people to leave country and family behind, often only to find themselves marginalized and rejected. Last December, once more here in Morocco, the Intergovernmental Conference on the Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration adopted a document intended to serve as a point of reference for the entire international community. At the same time, much still remains to be done, especially in passing from the commitments undertaken there, at least in principle, to concrete actions, and, more particularly, to a change of attitude towards migrants, one that sees them as persons, not numbers, and acknowledges their rights and dignity in daily life and in political decisions. You are aware of my great concern for the frequently grim fate of such people, who for the most part would not have left their countries were they not forced to do so. I trust that Morocco, which hosted that Conference with great openness and exceptional hospitality, will continue to be an example of humanity for migrants and refugees within the international community, so that here, as elsewhere, they can find generous welcome and protection, a better life and a dignified integration into society. When conditions permit, they can then decide to return home in conditions of safety and respect for their dignity and rights. The issue of migration will never be resolved by raising barriers, fomenting fear of others or denying assistance to those who legitimately aspire to a better life for themselves and their families. We know too that the consolidation of true peace comes through the pursuit of social justice, which is indispensable for correcting the economic imbalances and political unrest that have always had a major role in generating conflicts and threatening the whole of humanity. Your Majesty,
Distinguished Authorities,
Dear friends! Christians are deeply appreciative of the place accorded them in Moroccan society. They wish to do their part in building a fraternal and prosperous nation, out of concern for the common good of its people. In this regard, I think of the significant work of the Catholic Church in Morocco in providing social services and in the field of education, thanks to its schools, which are open to students of every confession, religion and background. In thanking God for all that has been accomplished, allow me to encourage Catholics and all Christians to be servants, promoters and defenders of human fraternity here in Morocco. Your Majesty,
Distinguished Authorities,
Dear friends! I thank you and all the Moroccan people once more for your warm welcome and your kind attention. Shukran bi-saf! May the Almighty, Gracious and Merciful, protect you and bless Morocco!
Thank you.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis signed, Saturday at the Throne room of the Rabat Royal Palace, the “Al-Quds Call,” aimed at promoting and enhancing the specific multi-faith character, spiritual dimension and special identity of the holy city. Here follows the full text of this Call, read out in Arabic by secretary general of the Higher Council of Ulema, Mohamed Yessef, and in Italian by Edgar Pena Parra, substitute at Vatican’s secretariat of State. “Call by His Majesty King Mohammed VI and His Holiness Pope Francis concerning Jerusalem / Al-Quds a Holy City and a Meeting Place On the occasion of the Holy Father’s visit to the Kingdom of Morocco, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI, recognizing the uniqueness and the sacred character of Jerusalem  (Al-Quds Al-Sharif), and caring deeply about its spiritual significance, as well as its special vocation as a city of Peace, issued this joint Call: “We believe it is important to preserve the Holy City of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) as a shared heritage of humankind and to safeguard it, above all for the believers of the three monotheistic religions, as a symbol of peaceful coexistence and as a meeting place where mutual esteem and dialogue are fostered. To this end, the specific multi-faith character, spiritual dimension and special identity of Jerusalem (Al-Quds Al-Sharif) need to be preserved and enhanced. We therefore hope that, in the Holy City, the followers of the three monotheistic religions will be guaranteed free access to religious sites, as well as the right to practice their faith there, so that from Jerusalem (Al-Quds Acharif), the believers may address a prayer to God, the Creator of all beings, for a future of peace and brotherhood on earth.” The ceremony was attended by head of government, Saad Dine El Otmani, the King’s advisors, Omar Azziman, Fouad Ali El Himma and André Azoulay, the minister of the Interior, the minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs and members of the delegation accompanying the Supreme pontiff.

Rabat – As Pope Francis’s arrival in Rabat today marks the second papal visit to Morocco, the event is reminiscent of John Paul II’s visit to the country in 1985—his first to a Muslim country following a direct invitation from its leader. When Pope John Paul II landed at Mohammed VI Airport in Casablanca, he knelt and kissed the Moroccan soil, a humble gesture conveying sentiments of love and tolerance toward the country and its people.  The pontiff was greeted by King Hassan II and King Mohammed VI, who was then Crown Prince.   Pope John Paul II’s visit was an opportunity to lay the foundations of the fraternity, mutual understanding, and interfaith bridge that has become a central pillar in the current pope’s repeated calls for dialogue between Muslims and Christians in Morocco. Pope John Paul II then made a speech in front of thousands of Moroccans at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca. At the time, “Pope John Paul II was concerned about the status of the Church in Morocco and as well as relations with Muslims,” says Vatican News. In his speech, the pope preached and praised the tolerance of Moroccans, but he also warned young Moroccans against extremism and violence.  “Wisdom teaches us that self-discipline and love are the sole levers for the desired renewal [of tolerance],’’ he had said.  John Paul II also visited the Royal Palace in Casablanca where he a military parade greeted him in the welcoming presence of the Moroccan royal family.  King Hassan II and Pope John Paul II met for the first time in Vatican, Rome. The Pope organized a reception in honor of the king who was accompanied by Princess Lalla Hasna, his youngest daughter.   On Saturday, the first day of his two-day stay, Pope Francis began his long-anticipated visit on a rainy day. Like they had done with John Paul II, Moroccans welcomed Pope Francis in an atmosphere of warmth and delight.   The Pope will visit the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V, the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams to meet with Islamic scholars and students, and head to the Caritas migrant center, where he will meet with a group of sub-Saharan migrants with whom he will share messages of hope and peace.  The Pope is also expected to meet with Morocco’s Christian community, including the congregation of Morocco-based bishops.  He will end his visit with a papal Mass on Sunday. The pope’s visit is a celebration of our shared humanity and an invitation to cultivate values of forbearance and togetherness.

Rabat – Head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Education Said Amzazi met on Friday with several associations representing students parents to update them on the government’s measures on the suspension of classes due to the ongoing contractual teachers’ protests. During the meeting, the associations of students parents called on the contractual teachers to resume work. Parents pleaded with the contractual teachers to put students’ interest ahead. El Othmani stressed that he personally follows the issue. He evoked the measures and solutions the government has taken to ensure the normal functioning of schools. Like parents, he noted that, students’ rights should be a top priority of school-related actions. While the protesting teachers have voiced the government’s passivity in meeting their demands for better working conditions, El Othmani explained that the government objectively handled the issue.  He said the government has made the necessary amendments to the government’s program for contractual teachers. The new program is similar to the one used for the permanent teachers employed in the public sector, giving contractual teachers roughly the same rights as their permanently hired peers, according to El Othmani. The head of government expressed dissatisfaction with the teachers’ strike, underlining that no one has the right to stop the functioning of any public service. Weeks-long suspension of classes is unacceptable and unreasonable because it impedes students’ rights, El Othmani argued. The minister of education highlighted the contract program reforms giving contractual teachers the same labor protection as permanent teachers. The pack includes health care, a pension fund, early retirement in case of a permanent sickness, and the right to promotions to posts with greater responsibilities.  Amzazi reassured parents that his ministry has taken the necessary and “practical” measures in cooperation with a number of partners to ensure that the protests do not clash with students’ rights for the rest of the school year. The associations’ representatives appreciated the government initiative to hold a dialogue with them, saluted the authorities’ efforts to address the crisis.

Here follows the full text of the speech: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, This is an exceptional day for two reasons. It is exceptional because of the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis. It is also exceptional because it reminds me of the historical visit the late Pope John Paul II paid to Morocco. Today’s visit falls within the framework of the longstanding relations between Morocco and the Vatican. I was keen to make sure the place and the date of the visit reflect the symbolic depth, the historical significance and the civilizational importance of this Meeting. The place where we are meeting today is an embodiment of openness, passage and cross-cultural fertilization; it is, in itself, a symbol of balance and harmony. Aptly located where the Bouregreg River meets the Atlantic Ocean, this place is aligned with the Al-Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech and with the Giralda in Seville – it constitutes a spiritual, architectural and cultural link between Africa and Europe. I also wanted this visit to coincide with the holy month of Rajab – a month that witnessed one of the most iconic episodes in the history of Islam and Christianity. It was in this month that, at the behest of Prophet Muhammad – may Peace and Blessings be upon Him – Muslims, fleeing persecution, left Mecca to take refuge with the Negus, the Christian King of Abyssinia. This was the first welcoming, during which Islam and Christianity made acquaintance with each other. Today, we are commemorating that act of getting to know each other, for the sake of the future and that of the coming generations. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Holiness’s visit to Morocco is taking place at a time when the Community of Nations – just like that of all Believers – is facing a number of challenges. We need to tackle these new ills which feed on treachery as much as on the instrumentalization of the Divine Message by advocating the denial of the Other and similar wicked theories. In a world in search of direction, the Kingdom of Morocco has never stopped proclaiming, teaching and experiencing, on a daily basis, Brotherhood among the Sons of Abraham. This is a founding pillar of the exceptionally rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. The symbiotic relationship uniting Moroccans – beyond faiths – is an eloquent example in this regard. This symbiosis is a fact of life in my country. It is reflected by the mosques, churches and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom since time immemorial. As King of Morocco and Commander of the Faithful, I am the Guarantor of the free practice of religion. I am Commander of all believers. And, as Commander of the Faithful, I cannot speak of the Land of Islam, as if only Muslims lived there. I am keen to ensure freedom to practise the religions of the Book and I am the guarantor of that freedom. I protect Moroccan Jews as well as Christians from other countries, who are living in Morocco. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have never ceased to seek God – beyond silence, beyond words and beyond the comfort of dogmas – so that our religions may remain crucial, illuminating bridges, and so that the lessons and messages of the Islamic enlightenment may live on. Given the reality of today’s world, it is clear the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions is insufficient. At a time when paradigms are shifting everywhere and concern all matters, inter-religious dialogue must evolve too. The dialogue centered on tolerance has been going on for a long time now; and yet, it has not achieved its goal. The three Abrahamic religions were not created to be tolerant of one another out of some unavoidable fate, or out of courtesy to one another. The reason they exist is to open up to one another and to know one another, so as to do one another good: “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know each other (not that you may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you”. The Word of God is Truth. Radicalism – whether it is motivated by religion or not – is due to failure to know one another, to ignorance of the other, and to ignorance pure and simple. Knowing one another eliminates radicalism – all types of radicalism. Knowing one another is precisely what is going to help us rise to the challenges of our tormented times. “To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He has given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues”. The Word of God is Truth. To tackle radicalism, the solution is neither military nor financial; that solution has but one name: Education. My plea for education is an indictment of ignorance. It is binary conceptions and the fact of not knowing one another well enough that are threatening our civilizations; it is certainly not religion. That is why, as Commander of the Faithful, I am advocating today that we give back to religion its rightful place in education. That is why I cannot speak to these young people without warning them against the phenomena of radicalization and of stepping into violence. What all terrorists have in common is not religion, but rather ignorance of religion. Today, religion should no longer be an alibi for ignorant people, for ignorance or for intolerance. That is because religion is Light; religion is Knowledge; religion is Wisdom. And because religion is Peace, it calls for diverting the energy spent on weapons and other misguided races towards loftier pursuits. For this reason, I set up the Mohammed VI Ulema Foundation. I have also responded favorably to requests from several African and European countries to take young people from these nations into the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams and male and female religious guides. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, In my capacity as Commander of the Faithful, I believe, just like the Holy Father, in an active spirituality that seeks to serve the common good. Spirituality is not an end in itself. Our faith translates into concrete actions. It teaches us to love our fellow human beings and to help them. One fact is essential: God forgives. “God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful”. And since God is mercy, generosity and kindness are at the center of my action. Because God is love, I have tried to make sure my reign is characterized by closeness to citizens as well as by assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people. That is the spirit of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) which I launched 14 years ago to improve the lives of people in precarious or fragile situations, integrate those who are excluded, put a roof over the heads of the homeless and kindle faith in a dignified future. That is also the philosophy behind the immigration and asylum policy which I have instituted and which is fundamentally based on solidarity. It is in line with the Marrakech Compact, which the international community adopted on 10 December 2018. Your Holiness,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, Our meeting attests to a mutually held belief that the values of monotheism contribute to rationalization, to reconciliation and to improving the world order. As Commander of the Faithful, and just like Your Holiness, I am against all forms of indifference and I wish, in this respect, to salute the courage of the Leaders who do not shy away from the defining questions of our time. I have been following with interest and appreciation Your Holiness’s efforts to serve peace in the world, as well as your regular calls to promote education and dialogue, to end violence, to combat poverty and corruption, to tackle climate change – to fight the ills plaguing human societies. As Commander of the Faithful and as Holy Father, we are called upon to be both idealistic and pragmatic, to be realistic and to set an example. Our messages do not concern our time only; they are eternal. They call upon people to embrace the values of moderation, to fulfil the imperatives of knowing one another and to raise awareness of otherness. By doing this, Your Holiness, you and I “will speak with one voice” – a voice which is not to be reduced to a mere consensus based on compromise. I see this – in my daily life – as a common message conveyed by Muslims, Christians and Jews to all of humankind. That is precisely what has brought us together today and what should unite us in the future. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh”.

By Amina Malik United Kingdom – Nabila Afilal will be returning to her homeland of Morocco to climb Mount Toubkal in hopes of raising awareness about mental health issues. Afilal is currently in the training phase to climb the 4,167-meter-high mountain in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains on May 10. A project manager at a consultancy firm, Afilal will be raising money for BIG in Mental Health, a British charity that aims to provide free mental health help. She believes depression to be an epidemic. The 38-year-old says on her Just Giving page, “I’m doing this enormous challenge as a means not only to push myself generally but I know getting to the top will require me to dig very deep mentally to keep going.  It’s not a comparison by any means of the daily challenges close friends and family have had over the years to even get up out of bed, to shower or to even smile.” Globally, depression is rapidly becoming a debilitating force. The World Health Organization states depression to be the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, due to economic stress and pressures, not everyone can access mental health care. A study titled “Mental Health Care and Human Rights in Morocco,” led by C. Aroui with a team from Hassan II University found an urgent need for mental health institutions in Morocco. Particularly, the study found mental health facilities in rural regions of Morocco to be lacking or totally non-existent. People in rural societies such as the Atlas Mountains, where Afilal will be climbing Mount Toubkal, therefore have few mental health resources. Rural Moroccan populations are just as susceptible to mental health issues as other populations, if not even more so. People who begin to manage their symptoms of depression such as lethargy, pessimism, and mental fatigue tend to subsequently increase productivity. Ultimately, there is a payoff to investing in mental health.  In many ways, investing in mental health is investing in the future. The government health department directs 4 percent of health care expenditures towards mental health. About half (49 percent) of mental health expenditures is for mental hospitals. Only severe mental disorders are covered in social insurance schemes. This method of pathologizing mental health is not only expensive, but it does not attend to the vast majority of Moroccans who could be productive but just need help. Half of the Moroccan population has a mental health issue, and 26 percent suffer from depression. Broad and affordable solutions should be made more readily available. The core aim of therapy is individual empowerment. Although the government can and should make changes, there is much someone who is suffering from a non-life-threatening depression can do. For instance, one easy-to-do yet often overlooked technique is to be aware of one’s internal dialogue throughout the day. Thoughts like, “I am stupid, I’ll never be any good” or “I’ll never find employment” create emotions such as sadness and fear. When these thoughts and feelings are repeated often they become mood disorders such as depression or anxiety. Watching and controlling our thoughts, telling ourselves the opposite of what we fear, “No I will pass the exam next month” for instance, will slowly start elevating our mood and self-esteem. Managing thoughts combined with self-care practices like listening to positive music, writing down feelings in a journal, creating a gratitude list, and eating to nourish the health of the body are all inexpensive ways of improving mood. Far too often, people are susceptible to blaming sihr (black magic), ‘ayn (evil eye), or Hasad (jealousy) for their mental health problems. This puts the responsibility outside of ourselves for change. However, religion teaches the exact opposite: God does not change the condition of those who do not change themselves. The first step to change our condition is to change our thoughts, and this is in our personal control. A cognitive behavioral therapist can help people with depression or anxiety with their thoughts and consequently change negative behaviors. These facilities require a few qualified practitioners and a safe building. Beds, ECT machines, even medication is usually not required for effective treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an affordable option for investment and can be easily distributed throughout Morocco. All that is required is awareness, training, and a genuine willingness to work together for a better tomorrow.

Rabat – Under the cover of surrounding buildings, dozens of people lined the streets of Rabat to welcome Pope Francis to Morocco, whose two-day visit will focus on interfaith dialogue and issues of migration. Rain showered the waving flags of the Vatican City and Morocco during the pope’s drive from the Rabat-Sale Airport to Hassan Tower. The overcast weather led to the cancellation of the pontiff’s parade down Mohammed V Avenue, his official welcome and greeting by King Mohammed VI at the Royal Palace. Instead, King Mohammed VI received the pope at the airport and escorted him to Hassan Tower — a long awaited meeting that was first officially announced in March. The last papal visit was 34 years ago in 1985, when Pope John Paul II was invited to Morocco by the late-King Hassan II with a similar hope of building a bridge between Muslims and Christians. In line with their commitment to interfaith dialogue, Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI signed the “Al-Quds Call.” The aim of the document is to promote the holy city of Jerusalem as a shared heritage of humankind. Amid news of political and religious divisiveness surrounding the historic city, the king and the pope said they hope to contribute to its safeguarding as a place for peaceful coexistence. King Mohammed VI introduced the pope by giving an opening speech at Hassan Tower. “Today’s visit falls within the framework of the long-standing relations between Morocco and the Vatican. I was keen to make sure the place and the date of the visit reflect the symbolic depth, the historic significance and the civilizational importance of this meeting,” said King Mohammed VI. After the king’s welcome, the pontiff gave his address to Moroccan authorities gathered at the Hassan Tower complex as hundreds of people in the neighborhood watched the historic event from the streets. Peaceful collaboration between Muslims and Christians is a central element of Pope Francis’ visit and speech. The pontiff has continuously advocated for greater interfaith dialogue throughout his six-year tenure. “I would like to affirm once more our need for cooperation in giving new impetus to the building of a world of greater solidarity, marked by honest, courageous, and indispensable efforts to promote a dialogue respectful of the richness and distinctiveness of each people and every individual,” said Pope Francis during the speech. He also said it was “essential” for all religious believers to respond to religious fanaticism and extremism with solidarity. The pope called religious extremism “an offense against religion and against God himself.” These statements come 15 days after a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which left 50 people dead and at dozens more injured. After his address, the pope paid his respects at the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V before leaving the center of Rabat to visit the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, where he met with Islamic scholars and students. The pope’s day ended at the headquarters of the Caritas migrant center, where he conveyed messages celebrating hope and shared humanity to a group of sub-Saharan migrants. “The church is aware of the sufferings that accompany your journey, and she suffers with you,” Pope Francis said to the migrants. “Every human being has the right to life. Every person has the right to dream and find his or her rightful place in our common home.” Catholic sub-Saharan migrants made up the majority of the people who, waiting outside the Caritas migrant center or packing the vicinity of the Hassan Tower Complex, came in flocks to watch the pope speech. Veronique, a migrant from Cameroon, who declined to give her last name to Morocco World News, hopes the pope’s visit will lead to a brighter future for Christians in Morocco. The 32-year-old is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Christian community in Morocco, which is approximately 2,000 to 5,000 people. “It is a very big moment that the pope is here because we have a lot of difficulty being accepted as Christian immigrants,” Veronique said. “It is important we have the right to pray and practice our religion.” Days before his visit, the pontiff thanked King Mohammed VI for allowing him to use Morocco as a platform to share his “profound convictions” of forgiveness, tolerance, interfaith dialogue, and peace. “As Muslims and Christians, we all believe in one God, the creator and most merciful who created men and established them in a shared world so that they live together as brothers and sisters and help each other in times of need,” said the pope in a video message published by Vatican News. During his address at Hassan Tower the pope again brought up his gratitude to Moroccan society and his hopes for the Christian community in Morocco. “Christians are deeply appreciative of the place accorded them in Moroccan society,” he said. “They wish to do their part in building a fraternal and prosperous nation, out of concern for the common good of its people.” As the pope spoke to the group, fellow Catholics, some of whom had come from Spain to support the pope, waited along with the many sub-Saharan migrants outside the Caritas center.  “The pope is the representative of God on Earth and he always increases and strengthens people’s faith,” said Marissa Lobato, a Spanish Catholic who had so far attended all of the pontiff’s events. “A visit is good because it is a bridge of unity.” Lobato, along with five companions, traveled from Spain to Morocco by ferry to see the pope and show their support for his positive platform on interfaith dialogue and migration. “I don’t know if it will change the lives of Christians in Morocco, but it will help a lot,” said Luis Filio, one of Lobato’s companions. “It will pave the way for understanding between religions.” The six Spanish travelers said they are looking forward to attending Pope Francis’ events tomorrow before taking the ferry home. The pope will begin his second and last day in Morocco in the city of Temara, just southwest of Rabat. There, the pontiff will visit the Rural Center for Social Services. He will then proceed to meet with priests and the Council of Churches in St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rabat, before traveling to the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, where he will host a mass.  The pope will then expect to leave for the Rabat-Sale Airport, where he will have a farewell ceremony before his flight back to Rome. Morocco is the second Arab country the pope has visited in 2019. The pontiff spent three days in the United Arab Emirates from February 3-5. During his UAE stay, Pope Francis reiterated his commitment to themes of inter-religious dialogue and solidarity among different faiths.  According to Vatican News, Pope Francis’s next international visit will be to Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from May 5-7.

Rabat – After Donald Trump’s Mexico wall claims, it is now the turn of Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s first far-right party Vox, to voice his intentions about building a wall at Spanish enclaves Melilla and Ceuta and make Morocco bear the cost of the project. Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s first far-right Vox party, is asking Morocco to pay for a wall he plans to build at Morocco’s border with the Melilla and Ceuta enclaves. He says the project aims at curbing the migrants’ flow. In a book titled “Santiago Abascal: Espana vertebrada” and published earlier this week, writer Fernando Sanchez Drago has published a book this week entitled revealed Abascal’s party immigration policies. The book states that Abascal wants to make Morocco pay for the wall because he sees the North African country as the primary culprit for the waves of irregular migrants that have reached Spain in recent years. According to the book, the party wants the Spanish army to monitor the borders until the construction of the walls is complete. Abascal also wants to introduce new irregular migration measures to prevent NGOs that, according to him, collaborate with Mafias to rescue migrants across the Mediterranean. The Spanish politician believes that “the great wall that we should be building is a psychological one and consists of informing immigrants that those who enter illegally in Europe will never be able to regularize their situation nor will they have the right to stay, nor will they have social assistance, nor will they be given a health card,” according to  Fernando Sanchez Drago’s book.

Rabat  – The National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) in Mehdya near Kenitra arrested on Thursday a night guard who, armed with a sharp weapon, robbed a woman and raped her in front of her baby. The 54-year-old man raped and abused the woman in a construction site he was guarding in Mehdya.  On Thursday night, police received a call from an anonymous person who reported the rape. The guard, the primary suspect was arrested on the same night, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Friday. Police immediately transferred the woman and her baby to a local hospital for emergency care. The baby was apparently not subjected to any form of violence, said DGSN. Police also seized the victims’ bracelet which the man had stolen during the robbery. The suspect is currently in custody pending investigations. Recently, Morocco has witnessed several shocking rape cases that became nationwide topics, including cases of sexual harassment and violence plaguing women. One of the rape cases that made international headlines and fueled the activism of national and international NGOs who was of Khadija, a teenager who was allegedly kidnapped, raped, held in captivity, and forcibly tattooed last summer.  According to an annual report issued by the King’s Attorney General, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi in 2018, there were over 1,600 rape cases reported in 2017 in the country. In hopes to eliminate sexual harassment and gender-based violence, Morocco enacted Law 103-13 in September 2018. But some women’s associations have expressed disappointment with the law.  They say it contains loopholes because some offenders still receive leniency, which,  according to the Union of Women’s Action (UAF), a Moroccan feminist association, will not allow the elimination of the violence that “affects two-thirds of Moroccan women.”

Rabat – The 58-year-old was subject to the international arrest warrant and red notice from the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) for an alleged premeditated murder, kidnapping, and escape from prison.  According to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the man, who goes by the nicknames “El Ruso” and “El Rober,” is linked to a violent criminal network in Spain.  The suspect took advantage of a hospital visit in Madrid to escape from prison on November 1, 2018, with use “violence against civil guards,” said the same source. The suspect managed to enter Morocco with a fake passport before local police in Tetouan identified him. The suspect is currently in custody pending more investigations before extradition to Spain. The investigations and arrest of the suspect are the fruit of a collaboration between Moroccan and Spanish security services.  Morocco and Spain share strong cooperation in countering terrorism and fighting transnational criminal networks. Following with King Felipe VI of Spain’s visit to Morocco in February, the two countries signed an agreement to combat terrorism; track down terrorist financing; fight drug trafficking, human trafficking, arbitrary arrest and detention, property crimes, money laundering, illicit trade of firearms, explosives, and nuclear materials.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, has expressed satisfaction with all government proposals to end the protests of teachers who describe themselves as the “forcibly contractual teachers.”  The contractual teachers, who have been protesting for four weeks in a row, are demanding better civil service benefits offered in the public sector. In response, the government has offered to abolish recruitment of teachers through contracts and hire the teachers as full employees of the regional academies of education. The teachers, however, found the offer unacceptable, arguing that regional academies lack the human and financial resources they need. El Khalfi said that the government has responded to all demands of the teachers as their status changed from being contractual employees to “regional employees.” El Khalfi argued that the aim is to “enable these teachers to be equal to the rest of the national education sector.” In the press conference held after the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Khalfi emphasized that the teachers should have reacted “positively” with the government’s measures, “especially as the contract was canceled.” El Khalfi added that the measure offered by the government is “irreversible.” No alternatives “The government did everything it could, and adopted a vision that was implemented gradually but quickly.” He added that the government will deal with the continuous strike by the teachers using measures within the law. “Regional academies will take the necessary measures to ensure the interests of students andto stem classes’ losses. Contractual teachers have been conducting strikes across the country. Said Amzazi, Morocco’s Minister of Education and Vocational Training, has already unveiled the government’s measures to deal with contractual teachers. In a Wednesday joint press conference with El Khalfi, Amzazi said that the government will send teachers warnings of expulsion and will cut their wages if they do not return to their work. Read Also: Moroccan Contractual Teachers Strike for 4th Week for Equality Amzazi said that contractual teachers are hampering their students’ education with their strike and demonstrations. “Despite the serious efforts we have made there is this coordination which incites employees at regional vocational training academies to stop working for the fourth week now. We are questioning, what is the legal status of this coordination? And does it have the legitimacy to lead a strike?” Amzazi asked. It remains to be seen whether the contractual teachers will resume their strikes, or the government’s statement to dismiss them for their absence will convince them to go back to work.

Rabat – As Morocco awaits Pope Francis’s highly anticipated weekend visit, March 30-31, sixty Christian migrants in Rabat are preparing to greet him. Pope Francis’s visit will be the second papal visit to Morocco, the first since 1985. The Vatican announced in January that the motto of the visit would be “hope,” and Moroccan bishops later clarified that the visit would revolve around interfaith dialogue and issues of migration, themes that the pope has pressed throughout his six-year tenure. But for Christian migrants who have sought aid from the Caritas Morocco center in Rabat, the significance of the visit will be felt on a more personal footing. The pope plans to spend an hour with them at the organization’s headquarters on Saturday.  Caritas is a collective of Catholic social service and relief organizations that operate in over 160 countries. Like other branches of Caritas, the organization’s Moroccan arm does diverse work—everything from agro-ecological projects to working with disabled individuals.  Migration, though, is a major focus for Caritas Morocco, and the primary reason for the pope’s visit. Caritas Morocco director Hannes Stegemann said in an interview with Morocco World News that he hopes the visit will bring attention to realities of migration in Morocco. The organization has worked with sub-Saharan African migrants in need since the early 2000s.  But the situation has intensified in recent years, and migrants are arriving in greater need. Caritas Morocco has assisted around 45,000 migrants since it began its work on migration nearly two decades ago, according to Stegemann. Now the organization, which also has branches in Tangier and Casablanca, works with 8,000 people annually. Over the past five years, though, migration in Morocco has transformed. More and more women with children and unaccompanied minors are arriving in Morocco to find opportunities—and coming to Caritas for support. “The profile of the migrants has changed drastically,” Stegemann said. “I think the migrant community realized that for the classical migrant, who is male and looking for work, the doors are closed.” Caritas, once accustomed to working with young men seeking employment, has been overwhelmed by the needs of the migrants that knock on its doors. Unaccompanied minors make up around 25 percent, Stegemann said. Their top countries of origin are Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Cameroon. Caritas provides a wide range of services to the migrants that come to their door. Depending on the needs of the person, that might be legal help, psychological support, or just a hot meal. Women and children, though, tend to need more long-term assistance. Caritas has seen women through pregnancies, prevented family separations, and tracked down relatives of children abroad. They rent apartments for two dozen minors who migrated, unaccompanied, to Morocco. “[It]’s a problem because it’s far more complicated far more expensive and, in terms of time, very time-consuming to accommodate these groups,” Stegemann said. “The need is high.” Caritas has persisted, though, he said, and is constantly adapting its strategy to the situation. “It’s learning by doing.” The high majority of the migrants Caritas serves are Christian, although the center does not discriminate on the basis of religion. It’s self-selecting, Stegemann explained; Caritas is a Catholic organization, and Christian migrants tend to require greater support integrating into Moroccan society. (People of sub-Saharan descent make up most Christians in Morocco.) And Caritas, itself, is a diverse mission. A third of its staff are sub-Saharan migrants, primarily Christian; another third are Moroccan; and a final third are European volunteers. It’s a prime example of the kind of interfaith cooperation that both Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI have lauded. Stegemann emphasized, too, that Caritas is just one part of the larger story of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco. “The migrant looking for assistance with Caritas is a migrant with problems,” he said—not one of the many migrants who have successfully integrated into Moroccan society. For these people, Pope Francis’s visit on Saturday may offer needed recognition and hope.

Rabat – The African Development Bank (AfDB) has once again approved a loan budget of over 400 million to back Morocco’s industrialization program. According to state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the loan will help finance projects initiated by small and medium-sized enterprises. AfDB’s manager in Morocco Leila Farah Mokaddem said, “This operation will help improve Morocco’s industrial competitiveness and strengthen its integration into African and global value chains.” The Moroccan Ambassador to Cote d’Ivoire Abdelmalek Kettani and the AFDB Vice President in charge of the regional development, regional integration and service delivery, Khaled Sherif, signed the loan agreement. MAP reported that the program aims to promote industrial acceleration in Morocco through the mobilization of industrial ecosystems, improving the competitiveness of operators in the sector and the financing of first-rate industrial economic activities. Mixed reception Although the loans granted to Morocco seek to contribute to its socio-economic development, several senior officials have warned against the issue of external debt and its influence on the country’s economic performance. The 2019 Global Firepower Index (GFP) found that Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt. Prior to this loan, several other international firms granted financial contribution to Morocco to carry out socio-economic projects. Earlier this month, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted Morocco an €80 million loan to contribute to enlarging the Casablanca highway. Several Moroccan officials warned against external debt. In January, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami said that Morocco’s economy will be weighed down by debt in 2019. The commissioner also warned that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of the GDP by the end of 2019, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018.

Rabat – Morocco’s berry exports increased remarkably from 66,332 tons in 2010-2011 to 115,442 tons in 2017-2018, announced the Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries, Aziz Akhannounch, at the National Festival of Berries in Kenitra. Morocco exported on average 60 to 70 percent of the total production of strawberries, 90 to 95 percent of raspberries, and more than 95 percent of blueberries, with the region of El Gharb, Loukkos and Souss Massa representing the three main areas red fruits are cultivated the most. The European Union demands red fruits from Morocco the most, with 90 percent of Morocco’s  total production going to EU countries, five percent to Asia, 1.5 percent to the Gulf countries, and 4.5 percent for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Africa, South America, Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), and Oceania. Akhannounch told Maghreb Arab Press Agency (MAP) that Morocco’s Green Plan has invested heavily in value-added agricultural value chains, noting that production and exports have increased by more than 85 percent. He also said that in 2018 the export volume increased by 48 percent compared to 2017, generating MAD 5 billion compared to MAD 2 billion. Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Regional Director of Agriculture Aziz Bellouti said that the festival comes in recognition of the region’s agricultural potential, particularly with the respect to the quality of the land and the abundance of water. On the sidelines of the festival, Akhannounch, Larache governor Bouassam El Alamine, and Australia’s Ambassador to Morocco, Berenice Owen-Jones visited Africa’s largest blueberries packaging station in Larache, which became operational two weeks ago. The station, which is 90 percent owned by Australian group Costa and 10 percent by the English group World Berry, is equipped with a blueberry packaging unit with a capacity of 100 tons per day and a refrigeration unit of 8,100 cubic meters.

Rabat – The weekly government council approved a draft decree against violence on Thursday on the elimination of sexual harassment and gender-based violence. The draft decree 2.18.856—presented by Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development Basima Hakkaoui—aims to implement the provisions of Articles 10, 11, 3, 15 of Law 103.13 enacted in September 2018. The aforementioned articles support female victims of violence through a number of mechanisms like cells and sectors-joint committees. Article 10 dictates that “cells of support for women victims of violence shall be established within courts of the first instance, courts of appeal, central and decentralized services of the sectors in charge of justice, health, youth and women, the General Directorate of National Security and within the High Command of Royal Gendarmerie.” Such cells will provide services such as reception, counseling, accompaniment, and other forms of support for female victims of violence. Article 11 requires the establishment of a national committee for support of women victims of violence. “The National Committee shall meet at least once a year, or whenever necessary upon invitation by the president or the majority of its members.” Article 12 stipulates the mission and tasks of the National Committee referred to in Articles 13, 14 and 15. The tasks range from ensuring communication and national coordination between government sectors and central administrations concerned with violence against women, to “giving its opinion regarding the action plans adopted by the regional and local committees.” The regional and local committees should determine the constraints and obstacles hampering the process of support provided for women, and propose appropriate solutions for them. The committee works are open for any person interested in women’s affairs, any representative of institution or association “which the committee sees useful to invite,” reads Article 15. During the meeting presided by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi and Hakkaoui enhanced the progress and achievements of the government’s equality initiative, “Ikram.” The “Ikram 2” 2018-2021, which follows the Ikram 1 plan, seeks to combat violence against women and ensure equality between men and women on economic, social, and political levels.  The “Ikram 1” 2012-2016 was dedicated to monitoring the National Observatory on Violence Against Women, a national campaign against domestic violence, in addition to the National Observatory for Improvement of Women’s Image in the Moroccan media. El Khalfi added that the government is also taking measures to implement the national strategy for 2018-2030 to combat violence against women. As for partnerships with civil society, El Khalfi affirmed that the government will finance women’s support centers throughout the next three years. The government allocated MAD 72 million (over $2.7 million) to 223 support centers for women between 2012 and 2017 to improve services, said El Khalfi. Women’s associations in Morocco have identified loopholes in Law 103.13 and recently expressed disappointment. On International Women’s Day, March 8, a Moroccan feminist association, the Union of Women’s Action (UAF), released a statement drawing attention to Moroccan women’s struggle with sexism, gender-based violence, marginalization, vulnerability to poverty, and lack of enforcement of their legal rights. In its statement, UAF said that “ the promulgation of Law 103-13 fighting violence against women has been a great disappointment due to its inability to protect against [violence], prevent it, and end impunity.” Because some offenders receive leniency, said UAF, the law will not allow the elimination of the violence “which affects two-thirds of Moroccan women.” The association also rued the fact that Morocco ranked among countries with a large gender gap—137th of 149 world countries. The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2019 report published on February 27 ranked Morocco third of Middle Eastern and North African countries in terms of gender equality in law and business.

Rabat – The National Ports Agency has said in a statement that the coal traffic increased by 28.9 percent, reaching 8.9 million tons in 2018, against 6.9 million tons in 2017.  Container traffic also increased by 1.6 percent, up from 11.9 million tons in 2017 to 12.1 million tons in 2018. Hydrocarbon traffic decreased by nearly 8 percent, down from 11.2 million tons in 2017 to 10.3 million tons in 2018. Morocco’s ports turnover slightly increased from MAD 1.74 billion in 2017 to MAD 1.78 billion in 2018. Operating expenses increased by 7.3 percent, reaching MAD 1.67 billion in income. The positive turnover is said to be due to three elements. One reason was an increase of MAD 34.5 million in study and service purchases. Part of that money served to upgrade certain port infrastructures and improve the quality of services.  The maintenance of port infrastructures for an amount of MAD 38.8 million and the implementation of investment projects resulting in amortization of MAD 31.6 million also contributed to the industry’s improved performance. The operating income decreased by 8.8 percent to MAD 227.3 million, while net income slightly increased from MAD 144.7 million in 2017 to MAD 147.1 million in 2018, up by 1.6%.

Rabat – On the sixth Friday since the start of anti-Bouteflika demonstrations in Algeria, tens of thousands of Algerians took to the street calling for both the president and his political “gang” to leave.  Days after Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s long-time ally, National Army senior officer Gaid Salah proposed the president’s removal through the Algerian Constitution, the people marched today to condemn the army’s intervention in the civil and political life. Chanting freedom slogans and carrying Algerian flags, the Algerian people reiterated their rejection of Bouteflika and his plans. They called for his entire political elite to step down, while also questioning the intentions of the army veteran, Gaid Salah. Algerians are demanding a drastic change in their country’s political system, evidencing growing distrust of the country’s independence war veterans.   Marchers said the country wants a ruler who can communicate with Algerians, deal with increasing socio-economic issues.  “We have only one word to say today, all the gang must go immediately, game over … the people want the fall of the regime,” an Algerian merchant told Reuters during protests on Friday, March 29—the sixth Friday since February 22. “Street pressure will continue until the system goes,” said another protester. Meanwhile, the ailing president Bouteflika has lost some of his strongest allies in the past few days. Powerful military chief Gaid Salah said on Tuesday that the solution to Algeria’s “crisis” is in the Algerian Constitution’s Article 102 which allows for the removal of an incapacitated president. On the other hand, journalist Hafid Derradji criticized Salah’s statement, calling it “circumentive,” and said that the “army should stay out of politics.”  “[Salah’s] intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of the temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” said the beIN SPORTS journalist. Bouteflika’s ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), supported Salah’s proposal, describing it as “a start to a constitutional plan that will allow us to protect our country from dangers.” The party has also rejected Bouteflika’s idea to hold a national conference which, saying that it is no longer a “valid” one. Another close ally who turned against Bouteflika is the former Algerian prime minister Ahmed Ouyahia, leader of Algeria’s National Rally for Democracy (RND) party. In a Tuesday message, Ouyahia urged Bouteflika to resign. Seddik Chihab, a spokesman for RND, which is in coalition with the FLN, took a scathing jab at Bouteflika’s administration in a statement on Wednesday. He described the regime  as a “cancer.” Although Bouteflika withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term, he announced his plan to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before electoral designation of a  successor.  By delaying the April 18 elections, Bouteflika effectively extended his fourth term indefinitely.

Rabat – Amid apparent icy relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Morocco’s foreign minister has again commented on diplomatic ties with its Gulf allies, urging reciprocity to salvage the damaged relations. Speaking on Thursday at a joint conference with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi, the Moroccan minister seized the opportunity to address the much-reported fallout with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Amid rumors of alleged friction, Bourita said that from “the point of view of Morocco, relations with Gulf countries,” especially Saudi Arabia and UAE, “have always been deep historical relations.” Morocco, he added, has always been keen to preserve and strengthen its diplomatic ties with the two Gulf countries.

Foreign policy is a matter of sovereignty, and in Morocco, it is also based on principles and constants,” said Bourita. According to the Moroccan official, maintaining cooperation should be a joint effort and a matter of reciprocal loyalty on important issues. He added that preserving the diplomatic ties should “be a concern on both sides, and if not, it would be normal for all alternatives to be examined.” In MENA regional crises like the situations in Libya and Syria, the Moroccan minister suggested, commitment to principles such as reciprocity should be the driving force of action. Bourita’s recent statement differ from previous remarks he made when asked about alleged friction between Rabat and Riyadh. Denying the reported spat, Bourita said in February that Morocco enjoys strong and historic diplomatic ties with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The rumors resulted from a documentary aired by a pro-government Saudi television channel against Morocco’s position in the regional conflict over Western Sahara. Following the broadcast of the controversial documentary, international news outlets reported that Morocco recalled its ambassadors from both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Bourita, however, denied the news, emphasizing that such decisions to recall ambassadors would be announced through its own special channels. Prior to Bourita’s latest statement, King Salman of Saudi Arabia called King Mohammed VI and requested Morocco to “review their brotherly relationship.” The latest comments on Morocco’s relations with Riyadh’s and Abu Dhabi suggest that officials may have taken into account the collective mood in Moroccan circles when reacting to perceived provocations from the two Gulf countries. While Moroccan officials remained silent in the first days of growing concern over some of Saudi Arabia’s actions towards Morocco, including the controversial Western Sahara documentary, Moroccans in chorus called for a strategic shift in Morocco’s stance vis-à-vis Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. They demanded reciprocity from the two kingdoms, arguing that Morocco did not owe loyalty to partners that fail to take its security and sovereignty seriously.

Rabat – During a joint press conference with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita on Thursday, Jordan’s foreign minister Aymane Safadi said that “Jordan has a consistent position on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara.” He added that his country “totally and absolutely supports the territorial integrity of the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco. The official also emphasized the importance of reaching an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1813, and within the framework of the Moroccan autonomy initiative. This is not the first time that Jordan has backed Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. In October 2018, the Jordanian foreign ministry emphasized the need to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict on the basis of the autonomy plan. Safadi said that his country will remain committed to its traditional “total and absolute support” for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Safadi’s recent statement falls within the context of a growing impetus to bolster regional cooperation on critical policy matters. In recent years, both Morocco and Jordan have expressed their determination to reinforce diplomatic ties, paving the way for more cooperation in several sectors. Safadi was among the Jordanian delegation which accompanied King Abdullah II of Jordan during his official trip to Morocco from March 27-28. King Abdullah left Morocco on Thursday after a busy agenda, including numerous audiences with King Mohammed VI. In their many discussions, the two Kings stressed the need for greater bilateral connections. The monarchs discussed several topics, including issues hindering the development of the Middle East like the Syrian and Palestinian crisis.  They called for more collective efforts to secure stability in Syria, while also reiterating their commitment to Palestine’s struggle for rights and self-determination.

Rabat – While Morocco recognizes the freedom of religious practice in its constitution, Christians dot not enjoy the same religious freedoms as Muslims, reports have suggested. Pope Francis’ official visit to Morocco from March 30-31 highlights the situation of Christians in Morocco, as Christian Moroccans have been vocal about their faith, especially on social media. A number of Moroccan Christians are taking the papal visit as an opportunity to raise issues of religious practice violations in Morocco. The number of Christians in Morocco has been decreasing since Morocco gained independence in 1956. Back then, the estimated number of Catholic Christians stood at nearly 300,000. Morocco was also home to more than 200 Catholic churches. Currently, there are 44 formal churches in Morocco, manned by 57 priests and pastors. The Catholic churches are administered by bishops in Rabat and Tangier. In the US government’s 2017 International Religious Freedom report, Christian leaders estimated there is 2,000 to 6,000 Christian citizens in Morocco. Another report by the NGO Aid to the Church in Need put the overall number as high as 40,000. The French arm of the Dutch Open Doors NGO put the number at 32,000 and claimed that Moroccan Christians have to practice their religion in secrecy. They cannot practice their faith in the open for fear of legal proceedings. By exposing their faith, Moroccan Christians might run the risk of being jailed for 6 months to 3 years in prison and a fine of MAD 200 to 500 ($21 to $53) under the pretext of proselytizing and shaking the faith of Muslims, prohibited in Article 220 of the Moroccan penal code, according to some Christian association representatives. Unlike many countries in Africa, however, Morocco does not impose the death penalty for apostasy under the penal code. However, the High Authority of Ulema, the most important religious authority in Morocco, issued a fatwa (religious edict) in 2013 stating that apostasy is punishable by death. While most Christians in Morocco are foreigners, there is a community of Moroccan Christians. There are an estimated 8,000 Moroccans who have converted to Christianity, most of whom are Protestant, according to the Observatory for Religious Freedom. Overall, however, there are more Catholics than Protestants in Morocco.  Constitutionally, Morocco recognizes Islam as its official state religion and Judaism as a native religion in Morocco, while guaranteeing freedom of religious practice to others. Foreign Christians enjoy full freedom to practice their faith under legal protection, although they do not enjoy the same legal status as people of Jewish faith. An AFP report indicates that some churches have allegedly been turned into mosques since independence, and others have fallen into disrepair. Reports estimate that over ninety percent of the Christians living in Morocco come from sub-Saharan Africa. That includes students on scholarships pursuing their studies in Morocco and migrants transiting from Morocco to Europe. In early 2019, a court in Taza, a city in northern Morocco, ruled in favor of a Christian man accused of “shaking the faith of a Muslim.”

Rabat – A senior Emirati official has slammed the traditional non-negotiation and principled Arab unity around the Palestinian cause, saying that a two-state solution is no longer feasible and Arab countries should change their approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s Foreign Affairs Minister, said in an interview with Emirati newspaper the National that it was “a very wrong decision” for Arab countries not to have normal diplomatic relations with Israel.  Despite a flurry of regional divisions on many issues, support to the Palestinian cause has remained perhaps the single steadfast rallying cry for MENA governments, with Arab countries traditionally saying that Palestinian’s rights to return should be the first condition of diplomatic normalization with Israel. Gargash, however, sees boycotting Israel as ineffective and counterproductive. He said Arab countries need a “strategic shift” in their relations with Israel if they are to expect a realistic end to the Israel-Palestine issue. “Many, many years ago, when there was an Arab decision not to have contact with Israel, that was a very, very wrong decision, looking back,” he said.  Gargash added that a more pragmatic and effective approach to ending the conflict would entail warmer relations with Israel. “Because clearly, you have to really dissect and divide between having a political issue and keeping your lines of communication open.” Two-state solution not feasible In recent months, US President Trump’s unapologetically pro-Israel moves in the Middle East, including the 2017 move to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the most recent controversial statements on the Golan Heights, elicited unanimous condemnations from MENA countries. In the Arab world, the condemnation of the US shift to an openly pro-Israel line was mostly due to the dismay at having Jerusalem stripped of parts of its Arab and Muslim identity. Arab leaders then called for the two-state solution, reiterating their commitment to the Palestinians’ struggle. According to Gargash, however, it is unrealistic to want Israel to return to the 1967 peace terms. Instead, he argued, pro-Palestinian voices should let go of the two-state solution and rather push for closer ties with Israel to broker peace based on new criteria. “A two-state solution will no longer be feasible because a sort of reduced rump state will no longer be practical,” the UAE minister said, adding, “What we are facing, if we continue on the current trajectory, I think the conversation in 15 years’ time will really be about equal rights in one state.” Gargash’s remarks come in the backdrop of reports that Israel and a number of Arab countries have been engaged in intensive behind-the-curtain negotiations to gradually establish official diplomatic lines of communication. While many of the concerned countries, including Morocco, have denied the reports, the Emirati official’s statements are bound to rekindle debates about Israel-Arab normalization. Meanwhile, as he campaigns for re-election in upcoming elections on April 8, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant about his Jewish nationalism-flavored stance on Palestine and other policy matters. “In the face of all pressure, I will always protect our country,” Netanyahu recently said, according to Reuters.  Like Gargash, the Israeli Prime Minister has maintained on numerous occasions in past statements that the two-state solution “is not going to happen.”

Rabat – After a flurry of controversies regarding the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the legitimacy of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, world leaders are reacting with outcry, condemnation, and anger. On Monday, March 25, US President Donald Trump officially recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory. Sunday, at an event in Washington, D.C., Prime Minister Viorica Dancila of Romania recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Washington, D.C., Dancila stated that Romania would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “I am pleased to announce today to the AIPAC audience that after the conclusion of the analysis by all the constitutional actors involved in the decision-making process in my country and, in full consensus, I as the Prime Minister of Romania and the Government that I lead, to move the Romanian Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel,” Dancila announced. If Romania moves its embassy, it would make Romania the first European country to do so and would contradict the EU’s consensus that the status of Jerusalem should be determined through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Romanian Senate President Calin Popescu-Tariceanu was previously invited by the Moroccan Speaker of the House of Councillors Hakim Benchamach to Morocco from March 27 to 31. However, after the comments made by the Romanian prime minister regarding Jerusalem, Moroccan officials transmitted via diplomatic channels that they would no longer be available for meetings. According to the Romanian Senate, Popescu-Tariceanu’s official visit to Morocco was postponed at the request of the Moroccan side of the arrangement. Popescu-Tariceanu was set to meet with leaders in the Moroccan Parliament, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, and foreign minister Nasser Bourita. Shortly after the prime minister’s comments, Jordan’s King Abdullah II canceled a visit scheduled for Monday to Romania. The Royal Hashemite Court attributed the decision to “solidarity with Jerusalem.” Jordan is the custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem’s Old City. In reaction to the criticism, Dancila backtracked her statement, calling it “a personal opinion.” Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, criticized Dancila’s comment, stating it was “ruining relations with the region.” He said Romania’s ties with Arab countries were one of “few constants of Romania’s foreign policy.” On Monday, US President Donald Trump officially recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The US is the first country to do so, and it reverses a US policy which has been in place for more than a half-century. Trump said the decision would allow Israel to defend itself from regional threats. The decision also boosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly before the upcoming Israeli elections on April 9. Israel captured the land from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel later annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move the United Nations condemned. Israel argues the strategic plateau is necessary to protect itself from Iran and Iranian allies in Syria. In a December 1981 resolution, the United Nations Security Council recognized Israel as “the occupying power”of the controversial region and said Israel’s desire to “impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.” This week, the UN reaffirmed the resolution, stating that the current Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues to adhere to the council’s resolutions. ידידי הנשיא טראמפ חתם על צו המכיר בריבונות ישראל ברמת הגולן. יום היסטורי למדינת ישראל! My friend President Trump signed an order recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights. A historic day for Israel! pic.twitter.com/dVAadIDxTH — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) March 25, 2019 
Outcry from the Middle East Shortly after President Trump’s announcement, leaders around the Middle East condemned and criticized the decision. The Syrian government called the decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty a “slap” to the international community and said it makes Washington “the main enemy” of Arabs. The Syrian foreign ministry also called the move a “blatant aggression” on its own sovereignty and said it represents the “highest level of contempt for international legitimacy.” On Tuesday, after calls from the leader of Hezbollah for “resistance,” thousands of Syrians protested in various cities around Syria against Trump’s decision. Saudi state news agency SPA stated that Trump’s recognition “will have significant negative effects on the peace process in the Middle East and the security and stability of the region.” The statement also called the decision a violation of the United Nations Charter and of international law. Lebanon’s foreign ministry recognizes the Golan Heights as “Syrian Arab” territory and said “no country can falsify history by transferring” land from one country to another. In accordance, Lebanese President Michel Aoun also stated the decision “causes particular concern in the countries neighboring Israel.” Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described the US to have “ignored international law.” The US has once again ignored international law. However, this decision will never legitimize Israeli occupation. On the contrary, it will further increase tensions in the region by preventing peace efforts in the Middle East. — Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (@MevlutCavusoglu) March 25, 2019  The Canadian foreign ministry reacted to the decision by releasing a condemning statement. “In accordance with international law, Canada does not recognize permanent Israeli control over the Golan Heights. Canada’s long-standing position remains unchanged.” Five ambassadors to the UN Security Council, from France, Germany, the UK, Poland, and Belgium, released a joint statement on the matter. “Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law,” and any unilateral border changes go against “the rules-based international order and the U.N. Charter,” read the statement published by the close US allies. “We raise our strong concerns about broader consequences of recognizing illegal annexation and also about the broader regional consequences.” The international human rights organization Amnesty International called the move “irresponsible, reckless and yet another example of the Trump administration violating international law and consensus by condoning Israel’s illegal annexation.” With Israeli elections approaching, the decision is likely to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election on April 9. However, the decision also sets a precedent that a country such as the US can ignore a UN Security Council resolution.

Rabat – As hours dwindle before the historic visit to Morocco of Pope Francis, March 30-31, Morocco has engaged in an intensive public relations campaign to broadcast its uniqueness and singularity in the Muslim world. The singularity, Moroccan officials have maintained over the past weeks, resides in that Morocco has a history of peaceful cohabitation with believers of other faiths, mostly Jews and Christians.  Morocco, a land of dialogue In statements from the Moroccan government regarding the schedule and the “historic significance” of the pope’s visit to Morocco, the consensus seems to be that Pope Francis’s choice of Morocco as a destination in his January-launched world tour does have a meaning.  Beyond the mere symbolism of the pontiff’s physical presence in Morocco, speaking side by side with King Mohammed VI on themes of peace, togetherness, and “celebration of our shared humanity,” the chorus among Moroccan officials has been that “Morocco truly is a land of dialogue and tolerance.” Central in the papal visit is Pope Francis’s insistence that “dialogue between Christians and Muslims will have a significant bearing on world peace,” according to a March 27 report from Morocco’s state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). MAP’s report, an interview with Khaled Akcha, a member of the Vatican-based Pontifical Committee on Interfaith-dialogue, where he is responsible for dialogue with Muslims, highlighted the meaning of the pope’s visit to the North African country, again putting it in the context of Morocco’s steadfast efforts in recent years to institutionalize diversity and tolerance. Read Also: King Mohammed VI Congratulates Pope Francis on 6th Year of Pontificate “The pope’s visit to Morocco is part of his desire to bolster dialogue between Christians and Muslims and strengthen world peace,” Akcha told MAP.  But beyond the significance that the visit may have on the global stage, that the pope chose Morocco also tells a lot about the country’s image and reputation, Akcha went on to argue. Morocco, he stressed, “has had, and has excellent ties with the Vatican.” The excellence of Morocco-Vatican relations, if Akcha were to be believed, is owed to Morocco’s “history of secular openness.”  A history of openness Having been the cradle of some of the world’s oldest universities where people came to study from surrounding Muslim and non-Muslim kingdoms, the country has long boasted a “reputation of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the concert of nations.” In May 2018, representatives from nearly 100 countries convened in Marrakech to discuss tolerance and celebration of diversity in a world of increasing hostility to migrants and people thought to be threats to the social fabric of societies where they live and work.  At the end of the meeting, they issued what they called the “Marrakech Declaration.” This, they said, was to propel Morocco, and the world with it, into an age where all countries will treat their citizens on the same footing, regardless of religion, gender, or race. While Morocco cannot be said to have achieved all points addressed in the Marrakech Declaration, it has done a lot in recent years to deserve much of the praise that has come its way as a diversity-friendly country, MAP’s interview suggested. In another report on the meaning of Pope Francis’s Moroccan visit, MAP gave a history-saturated list of reasons why Morocco is a sound choice for a papal visit. Morocco focuses on peace, dialogue, and openness to difference in a world of resurging claims of identity.  Reprising many of the arguments from earlier government statements, MAP’s report argued that the pope’s visit is a “consecration of Morocco’s cultural and civilizational singularity” as a historical land of intercultural relations. MAP wrote: “Throughout its history, and this is true in modern-day Morocco, the kingdom has always been a land of peaceful coexistence, encounters, tolerance, and interactions between Muslims and followers of other faiths, particularly Christians and Jews.” The report argued that Pope Francis’s visit should be read in that context of Morocco’s “secular heritage” of trans-cultural and trans-religious dialogues.  Evoking the 2011 Constitution, MAP went on to heap lavish praise on Morocco’s “genuine efforts” to go down a path of good governance where citizens, no matter which religion or political ideology they espouse, are treated like countrymen of equal religious and political worth. After all, MAP argued, Morocco rose above one of modern history’s darkest hours when it stood up “to France Vichy regime by refusing to hand over Moroccan Jews” and a number of Jews who made it to Morocco while fleeing from Nazi persecution in Europe.  “Morocco was also Pope John Paul II’s choice for his first visit in the Muslim world,” the article reminded readers. Not a bed of roses But the government and Moroccan newspapers have not been the only participants in the mass of “celebrating Morocco’s history of tolerance.” For its laudable reforms and actions to be seen as perhaps the entire MENA region’s strongest bastion of religious tolerance, Morocco’s legal tradition has not been particularly welcoming of the country’s minority of Christian converts, according to a recent Reuters report. “We want laws that protect religious minorities in the country on an equal footing. We will seize the pope’s visit to put more pressure on the state to protect religious freedoms,” one leader of an association of Moroccan converts told Reuters.  While acknowledging Morocco’s religious reforms, especially its efforts to market itself as “an oasis of religious tolerance in a region torn by [Islamist] militancy,” the newspapers spoke of the grievances of Morocco’s existing but largely invisible community of Moroccan Christians. “Moroccan converts say they are forced to worship at home, in secret,” the Reuters report noted. It added, “Conversion from Islam to Christianity is banned – as it is in many Muslim countries – and proselytizing is punishable by up to three years in prison.” In response, the Moroccan government denied the degree of gravity highlighted in the complaints of Moroccan Christians. According to the government, everyone in Morocco is free to practice their religion.  What the country’s laws forbid, however, the government has insisted, is proselytism. Outside of the spaces—mosques and religious schools—allocated for religious discourse, even Muslims are barred from engaging in proselytizing activities, the government has maintained. While it is unclear whether the reported suffering and legal problems of Moroccan Christians has links with their engagement in proselytism, the government’s denial is buttressed by a number of recent actions against what it perceived as “Islamist proselytization.”  In an unprecedented series of raids in February, the Moroccan government cracked down on Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane, one of the country’s most revered Islamist organizations. Dozens of the Islamist fraternity’s villas and meeting halls were closed, with the movement’s leaders also complaining about the “retreat of religious freedoms” in the country. Such occurrences led some to ask about the truthfulness of Morocco’s tolerance rhetoric. How tolerant is Morocco? Does the government’s gospel of religious tolerance and openness to diversity belie its actions on the ground against religious practices that do not embrace the government’s preferred line of religious experience?  “There is no persecution in Morocco and there is no discrimination on the basis of faith,” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said.

Rabat – Prior to his much-publicized visit to Morocco March 30-31, Pope Francis has sent a message of gratitude and peace to King Mohammed VI and Morocco. In a two-minute video published by Vatican News, the pontiff thanked the King for allowing him to use his country as a platform to preach the messages of mutual understanding, tolerance, forgiveness, and interfaith dialogue that have come to define the pope’s tenure as the highest authority of the Catholic church. “Assalamou Alaykoum dear people of the Kingdom of Morocco,” the pope said, starting off with the traditional Moroccan and Islamic greeting. The message continued, addressing Moroccans and their King: “I will soon pay a two-day visit to your country. I praise the Lord for the opportunity that he is offering me. I am also thankful towards His Majesty King Mohammed VI for his caring invitation and the generous collaboration of Moroccan officials.”  In line with his usual message of dialogue and togetherness between world religions, Pope Francis underlined the critical importance of rapprochement between Islam and Christianity for the future of world peace. As the two major and most expanding religions, Pope Francis suggested, Islam and Christianity have an even greater role to play in the world today in the face of people using the two religions for their own political and ideological ends. “As Muslims and Christians, we all believe in one God, the creator and most merciful who created men and established them in a shared world so that they live together as brothers and sisters and help each other in times of need.” Condemning what he perceives as the political instrumentalization of religions, the pope said that the purpose of all religions is to bear witness to God’s design when he created human beings: Embracing diversity and “responsibly preserving the earth for future generations.” Pope Francis said, “I will be more than happy to directly share with you these profound convictions of mine.” Read Also: King Mohammed VI Congratulates Pope Francis on 6th Year of Pontificate During his visit, Pope Francis will meet with Morocco’s Christian community. A fervent defender of migrants’ rights, the pontiff will also spare some of his time for Morocco’s migrant community. To them, too, Pope Francis said he will convey “encouraging messages” of peace and togetherness. “Dear Moroccan friends, I sincerely thank you for your hospitality and your prayers, reiterating my own prayers for you and your beloved country. See you soon,” the message concluded.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan met on Thursday at the Royal Palace in Casablanca to discuss wide-ranging issues driving politics in the Middle East.  In their discussion, the two leaders’ agreed to strengthen the Moroccan-Jordanian diplomatic ties. They also stressed the importance of collective actions to face some of the most high-priority issues of the region. In a subsequent show of the two kingdoms’ commitment to the principles discussed in the monarchs’ meeting, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita joined Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi in releasing a press statement that reiterated the two Kings’ insistence on greater regional dialogue to solve crises.  The press release said that the two countries will collaborate on several sectors, including energy, agriculture, and tourism. The statement also announced that a delegation from Morocco’s General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and the Moroccan Professional Group of Banks (GPBM) will visit Jordan to explore investment opportunities. King Mohammed VI also ordered the establishment of a training center in the fields of tourism, agro-Industry, construction-public works, energy, and water resources in Jordan. The move is aimed at easing expertise sharing and expanding trade ties between the two kingdoms.   Read Also: Jordanian King Abdullah II Cancels Romania Trip to Visit Morocco Unwavering support to the Palestinian people  In addition to the business cooperation, the Palestinian cause was at the heart of the topics discussed between the two sovereigns. King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan reiterated their full support to the Palestinian cause, emphasizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Both monarchs condemned Israel’s growing worrying policies  in Jerusalem. They said Israeli authorities are undermining the city’s ’s legal and historical status, as well as its demographic and spiritual make-up.  They said that Palestinians’ right to return to Israeli-occupied territories and their struggle for equal and dignified treatment as citizens should remain a rallying cry for governments of the MENA region.   King Abdullah II commended the continued efforts of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of Al-Quds Committee, in favor of Jerusalem and the Palestinian people. Prior to his visit to Morocco, King Abdullah II canceled a state visit to Romania, protestating the southeastern European country’s recently announced stance on the status of Jerusalem . On Sunday, March 24, Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila her country would soon move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move stirred controversy in the international community, especially in the Muslim World, where the Palestinian cause is a cause celebre. For many governments in the region, including Morocco, support for Palestine is a high-priority policy. In response to Romania’s prospective Jerusalem move, Morocco postponed the visit of a Romanian official, according to Romanian news outlet G4 Media.  Commitment to Syria’s unity and territorial integrity  The two King also discussed the importance of combining efforts to end the Syrian crisis in accordance with Security Council resolution 2254. The resolution, according to the monarchs, will preserve the unity and cohesion of Syria, restore security and stability in the country, while also facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland to contribute to reconstruction efforts. King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II also welcomed Iraq’s victory over ISIS, expressing their support for its stability. King Mohammed VI also applauded the Jordanian efforts in welcoming large numbers of Syrian refugees. He, however, called for further support to ensure the continuity of the humanitarian act. A Moroccan military field hospital was established in Zaatari camp in Jordan in 2012 to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees. As of November 2015, UNHCR reported that Jordan hosts 1.4 million Syrian refugees. The two monarchs also condemned Israel’s move towards the occupied Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. It annexed the territory in 1981 and has since maintained control over it.  On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation officially recognizing Israeli authority over the occupied Golan Heights. The United Nations said that its position “has remained unchanged from last week to today” despite Trump’s action Rejecting Trump’s declaration, Both King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II maintained that the Golan Heights is a Syrian land. Israel’s decision, they said, violates international law.

Rabat – The Somali minister of foreign affairs, Ahmed Isse Awad, has stressed his country’s support for Morocco’s national territorial integrity and appreciated Morocco’s support for Somalia. “In Somalia, we stand alongside the Kingdom of Morocco on the issue of its territorial integrity,” Awad declared earlier this week. He also said Morocco’s support is “very important for the strengthening of Somali institutions.” Morocco and Somalia held a signing ceremony on Tuesday, March 26, where they inked three MoUs to strengthen cooperation in politics and diplomacy. The signing ceremony comes at a time when Somalia is in the grip of a decades-long civil war. Many of the Somali population who were vulnerable to war, drought, and food insecurity, have found refuge in other countries, including Morocco. Morocco has granted refuge to seven Somali refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told Morocco World News. According to a 2017 report by the UNHCR, as many as 900,000 Somalis were displaced in the surrounding regions since 1992. In a 2018 report, UNHCR noted that Somalia is the fifth highest country of origin of refugees in the world, with an estimated 1 million refugees worldwide. Some Somalis escaped the violence and came to Morocco as a destination rather than a transit country. In reference to Morocco’s welcoming migration and asylum policy, UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi described Morocco as a model for other countries to follow.  The Moroccan and Somali foreign ministers, Nasser Bourita and Ahmed Isse Awad, signed the three MoUs on Tuesday. The first memo created the Morocco-Somalia High Joint Committee to be presided over by the foreign ministers of Morocco and Somalia. The aim is to ensure consultation and political cooperation on bilateral issues relating to regional and international common interests.  The High Joint Committee will implement cooperation at the levels of economy, finance, commerce, culture, science, judiciary system, consulate, and society. It will also monitor the process of putting into practice the agreements, treaties, and MoUs.  The second MoU intends to create a consultation facility between senior officials of the two ministries to hold regular meetings on bilateral relations and regional and international issues. The third memorandum concerns the consolidation of cooperation on diplomatic training for diplomats of both countries.  Through the partnership, Morocco and Somalia will train young diplomats within a framework of preparatory training courses and facilitate the exchange of experiences and information. In 2016, Morocco’s Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufik signed a cooperation agreement with his Somali counterpart to improve bilateral exchange in the religious field between Morocco and Somalia.  In March 2018, Morocco’s Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit held a working session with his Somali counterpart, Mohamed Abou Bakr Eslo, after the 35th session of the Council of Arab Interior Ministers.  The two countries discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security, especially in fighting terrorism and radicalization.

Rabat – The Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) hosted a seminar on Wednesday, March 27, in Tunis to present the Trans-Maghreb Railway Line project.  The seminar, chaired by Taieb Baccouche, the secretary-general of the AMU, discussed the rehabilitation and modernization of railways in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia as part of the planned cross-border railway line. The project involves constructing a new crossborder railway from Annaba, Algeria, to Jendouba, Tunisia; modernizing the Jendouba-Jdeida railway line in Tunisia; modernizing the railway line connecting Fez and Oujda in Morocco; and rehabilitating the line between Oujda and Akid Abbes, Algeria. Participants discussed the ways for private and public agencies to finance and implement the Maghreb railway project. The AMU said in February that it had received the financial support of the African Development Bank (AfDB) to fund the preparatory activities of the project railway. Through the project, the AMU hopes to create a Maghreb economic union that will take charge of managing goods and passenger traffic between the three countries. The project will strengthen the economic and social integration of the citizens of the region, according to an AMU statement. It will facilitate job creation and support national economies. The $3.8 billion railway line is expected to span over 2,350 kilometers, according to Al Jazeera.  According to Railways Africa, the overall project is expected to link Casablanca to Tripoli, and is only set to finish in 2060. Once the Casablanca-Tripoli railway is complete, it would take 15 hours to travel between the two cities. In addition to its “economic and trade” benefits, the project would drive the Maghreb countries to further integration, which would help “sustain peace and security” in the Euro-Mediterranean area, the former head of the Rapid Rail Network (RFR) of Greater Tunis, Kamel Ben Amor, told the Arab Weekly news outlet. Representatives of the AfDB, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency, the Maghreb Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade (BMICE), and global and regional banks attended the meeting. The general director of the Algerian National Railway Transport company (SNTF), Yacine Bendjaballah, proposed the project in 2015. Morocco’s border with Algeria has been closed nearly continuously since 1994. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have national rail networks constructed under the French colonial rule decades ago. Morocco has other rail extension ideas beyond the Maghreb line. In February, Morocco and Spain announced they were studying the possibility ofto connecting the two countries through an intercontinental railway line. The study phase will take one to two years, said Morocco’s State Secretary to the Minister of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics Mohamed Najib Boulif.

Rabat – Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that contractual teachers are hampering their students’ education with their strikes and demonstrations, vowing to expel the protesting teachers. During a press conference on Wednesday, March 27, Amzazi announced that the government will start procedures to fire the protesting teachers hired through regional academies across the country. Expressing frustration with the protests, the minister warned the teachers that the government will send them warnings of expulsion and will also cut their wages if they do not return to their work.  Amzazi also strongly criticized the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) “forced into contractual teaching” for encouraging strikes that have lasted for four weeks so far. He argued that the coordination is only adding fuel to the fire and hindering the government’s efforts to find solutions. “Despite the serious efforts we have made there is this coordination which incites employees at regional vocational training academies to stop working for the fourth week now. We are questioning, what is the legal status of this coordination? And does it have the legitimacy to lead a strike?” Amzazi affirmed that if the teachers resume their work and end their strike, the government will “provide them with all their needs and guarantee all their rights, except for the deduction of their wages,” which the government will still execute. The decision also includes the 15,000 teacher trainees at regional academies. Like the contractual teachers, the trainees will receive a warning letter, and if they do not end their strike within five days, they will be replaced by others on a waiting list. According to Amzazi, in the past four years, the government employed 70,000 teachers who were jobless. “They now have an honorable job and important job,” he stated. Beginning in February, more than 10,000 young teachers who describe themselves as “forcibly contractual educators,” made international headlines with days of marches and protests in Rabat.  The marches, organized by the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) “forced into contractual teaching,” rose against the signing of a contract extension for contractual teachers hired in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The protesting teachers are denouncing the government for not meeting their demands and accuse it of “discriminating between teachers” in Morocco through the contracts. Contractual teachers do not benefit from rights granted by the employment law for public sector employees like permanent teachers. Contractual teachers also have a smaller pension, and their salaries come from the educational academies with whom they are contracted for a certain period of time. According to the contracts, teachers’ salaries can increase depending on the employee’s pay grade. However, the ministry did not abide by some of the conditions in the contracts, teachers say. The teachers say the government should increase their salary by MAD 100 each year. The Ministry of Education offered to change the teachers from “contractual teachers” hired under fixed terms to full employees of the regional academies of education, but the teachers did not accept the proposal. The teachers said that the regional academies do not have the human and financial resources to adopt all of them.

Rabat – France’s Secretary of State for Digital Affairs Mounir Mahjoubi is stepping down from office to run for the Paris mayoral election, announced the Elysee in a statement on March 27. At the suggestion of Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed Mahjoubi alongside Minister of European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau and Government Spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux, because the three are campaigning for elections. The president is following the principle that politicians cannot fulfil their functions as well while campaigning, according to France24. Loiseau will head the La Republique en Marche (LREM) candidate list for the European elections on May 26. Griveaux and Mahjoubi are both LREM candidates to be mayor of Paris in the March 2020 local elections. Mounir Mahjoubi, a 35-year-old French-Moroccan, was appointed the secretary of state  for digital affairs in May 2017. In January, Mahjoubi announced the creation of Next40, an index of 40 French tech start-ups with strong economic and environmental potential. Mahjoubi holds a degree in business law and finance. Between 2002 and 2007, he spent his weekends working as a technician for the Internet Club, one of France’s first internet service providers.  In February 2017, Mahjoubi worked as the digital manager of Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign. Mahjoubi’s Moroccan parents came to France in the 1970s from the town of Afourar in central Morocco.

Rabat – Long before the start of the political unrest and protests in Algiers, the Sahrawis of Tindouf began their revolt against the ever-increasing corrupt, self-serving, and tribal policies of their “leader” Ibrahim Ghali. As the situation worsens in the Camps, Morocco appears unprepared to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reassure its Sahrawi citizens to return home. This episode should serve as a wake-up call for Moroccan authorities to set up programs to help defectors find a way to escape to Morocco or Mauritania where they can be processed for resettlement. The crisis in Algeria poses not just widespread political, but also economic and security, implications on Algerians as well as Sahrawis who live on international aid. The social upheaval in its neighbor to the east should not distract Rabat from its main mission to read, analyze and act on signs of possible mass desertions from Tindouf. Indeed, recent events in Sahrawi camps, including the desertion of the young officer, reveal the extent of the political turmoil in Algiers on the moral and dedication of Polisario fighters. There has been widespread discontent in the ranks of the Polisario Militia for a long while, especially since the death of some militiamen due to medical neglect last year. This incident led to protests around the refugee camps and calls for the resignation of high-ranking members of the armed group. Before that, more than thirty members of a security service called “National Gendarmerie” went on strike to protest their living conditions, meager salary, and the dwindling numbers of their force. According to sources in Shahid El Hafed where the strikers took refuge back in September, there has been an ongoing dispute between senior leaders of the Polisario over control of resources and funds of some armed units. Furthermore, the escape recently pulled off by drug traffickers from Polisario’ s facilities in Imhiriz and Tifariti rocked the camps and exposed the level of corruption and collusion between members of the organization and drug lords active in the Sahara and the Sahel regions. These incidents show Polisario’ s abandonment of its fighters and its leadership loss of control in the camps. There is a feeling in Tindouf that Ibrahim Ghali lost his compass, revolutionary and ideological, and that he is unable to lead. Given the volume of information that the Sahrawi and Spanish press have circulated about the level of disgruntlement among the Sahrawis military and civilian, an inevitable question is whether Moroccan intelligence officials have viable, sufficient and reliable plans to encourage, seduce and convince fighters to leave Tindouf. The unprecedented level of political and military interdependence between the Algerian military and the Polisario and the shaky political environment in Algiers are making some rebel leaders think about jumping ship and joining the Moroccan Sahara. Algerian and Polisario propaganda has misrepresented the truth about life in the Moroccan Sahara. The Kingdom, unfortunately, has done an average job highlighting the true situation in Laayoune, Dakhla, and Smara. The return of the 29- year-old “Captain” who drove his military vehicle and surrendered to Moroccan official is a significant event. While this type of desertion is the first in many years, it came at a sensitive time for the Polisario and the Algerian military. Decades of poor governance, mismanagement of international aid and tribal favoritism have given birth to a wave of dissent, rage, and disillusion with the revolutionary dream of an independent state. Today, thousands of Sahrawis including members of the armed militia are ready to leave the harsh conditions of the refugee camps for a normal life in the Moroccan controlled Sahara. The Moroccan intelligence community needs to organize centralized teams that can work across multiple agencies.  It must avoid the fragmentation of information, skills, and operations that can lead to failures. Rabat can successfully tackle the challenges in Tindouf if members of its intelligence organizations work hand in hand as one team and use and share all analytic resources and reports about conditions on the ground.

Rabat – The Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), President Abdelaziz Bouteflika‘s party, called for the invocation of the Algerian Constitution’s Article 102, allowing for the removal of an incapacitated president. In a statement released on Wednesday, FLN supported the proposal of Ahmed Gaid Salah, the Algerian National Army senior officer and Bouteflika’s long-time ally, to remove the president from power by applying Article 102. “We announce our support for the initiative as a start to a constitutional plan that will allow us to protect our country from dangers,” stated FLN. The party has also rejected Bouteflika’s idea to hold a national conference, saying that it is no longer a “valid”one. Although he withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term, Bouteflika plans to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. By delaying the April 18 elections, Bouteflika effectively extended his fourth term indefinitely. Meanwhile, Seddik Chihab, a spokesman for Algeria’s National Rally for Democracy (RND) party, which is in coalition with the FLN, described Bouteflika’s administration on Wednesday as “cancer.” Another ally of Bouteflika who turned against him and joined the voice of the Algerian people is former Algerian prime minister and RND leader Ahmed Ouyahia, who urged Bouteflika to resign in a message on Tuesday. In a speech on Tuesday, March 26, Gaid Salah, the most powerful army chief, insisted that the solution to Algeria’s “crisis” is in the Constitution. “We must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework that is the only guarantee to preserve a stable political situation,” Salah said. Algerian beIN SPORTS journalist Hafid Derradji, on the other hand, criticized Salah’s statement, calling it “circumentive,” and said that the “army should stay out of politics.”  “[Salah’s] intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of the temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” wrote Derradji on his Facebook page on Tuesday. Since February 22, hundreds of thousands of Algerians have been protesting in the anti-Bouteflika demonstrations, including students, judges, lawyers, unions, and many others.

Rabat – A group of 12 Polisario soldiers have presented themselves to a Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) unit near Mahbess, north-eastern Western Sahara. The 12 soldiers arrived wearing military uniforms and chanting slogans praising King Mohammed VI. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath reported Wednesday that the soldiers have been authorized to enter Moroccan territory after identity verification. This comes nine days after a 29-year-old Polisario officer arrived at the Moroccan defense line,   fleeing from Algeria. The officer had said that there are other Polisario army members who wanted to leave Polisario and return to Morocco. It remains unclear whether the 12 were Polisario deserters or Moroccan soldiers detained by Polisario. Mustapha Salma, a former leader in the Polisario Front, announced Wednesday in a Facebook post that the 12 soldiers belonged to a group of 19 Moroccan soldiers Polisario has held in custody 100 kilometers south of Mahbess in the Tifariti area, alleging that they are drug dealers. Mustapha Salma stated that 8 soldiers fled the Polisario Front in November 2018, escaping from years of detention in inhumane living conditions. Many former Polisario members have returned to Morocco from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, including Yenja Khattat, current president of the Dakhla region, and Bachir Dkhil, one of the founders of the Polisario Front. Sahrawis have conducted several protests against poor living conditions inside the Tindouf Camps. In the most recent protest, they conducted a sit-in at the United Nations Square in Geneva on March 17, to denounce the recruitment of children in the Tindouf Camps into armies and terrorist groups by Polisario.

Rabat – After long debates, Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi’s proposal to teach more subjects in French at schools has won the favor of the majority of the heads of political parties in Parliament on Monday, March 25. The parliamentary meeting, attended by Amzazi and Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki, agreed on a reform to teach science and technology subjects in French.  Amzazi argued that “some subjects should be taught in a foreign language,” referring to French, “for the benefit of students.” The decision is in line with the Strategic Vision for the Reform of the Moroccan School launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research in 2015. On Thursday, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani will sign a decree to convene an extraordinary Parliament session in April, which will review and implement the pedagogical reform. The debate on which foreign language would be more useful in the Moroccan educational system continues, especially when it comes to science. Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) are the official languages of Morocco, and French is the primary foreign language in the country.  As some Moroccans, including politicians and professors, believe that schools should teach science in French, others vouch for other languages like English and Arabic. Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane defended the use of Arabic in national education during the National Conference on the Arabic Language on March 15 at the National Library (BNRM) in Rabat. Benkirane also preferred English over French. “If [higher] education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French,” he stated.

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Rabat has sentenced four journalists and one member of Parliament to a six months suspended prison sentence and a fine of MAD 10,000, each. The journalists—Mohamed Aheddad with Al Massae newspaper, Abdelhak Belachgar with Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper, and Kaoutar Zaki and Abdelilah Sakhir with Aljarida24 online outlet—and MP Abdelhak Hissane began their trial in early 2018. The president of the House of Councillors, Hakim Benchamach, brought the lawsuit against them. Benchamach sued the four journalists for reporting “on excerpts of the classified documents, in December 2016, of the former head of government, Abdelilah Benkirane, in the commission of inquiry into the deficit of the Moroccan pension fund (CMR),” according to Medias24. He sued Hissane for leaking the information. The journalists and the MP were prosecuted under Article 14 of the procedural rules governing parliamentary commissions of investigation.  The article stipulates total confidentiality in the commission’s work. Anyone who has published information from the commission can incur a sentence from one to five years in prison, with a fine from MAD 1,000 to 10,000. Mohamed Aheddad declared to AFP news agency that “the verdict is against the freedom of expression.” Aheddad further stated that he was prosecuted along with the other journalists for “publishing accurate information.” He said that they would appeal the verdict and argued that he is convinced of his innocence. MP Abdelhak Hissane told AFP, “The verdict is unfair and based on nothing.” He added that “the journalists were just doing their job.” In agreement, the National Union of the Moroccan Press (SNPM) published a statement on March 27, condemning the verdict, considering it “unfair towards the four journalists and the freedom of the press.” The SNPM holds Benchamach responsible and described him as a “self-proclaimed opponent of the freedom of the press and expression.”

Rabat – The Australian teenager known as “Egg Boy” who gained international praise after he cracked an egg on a far-right politician’s head has broken his media silence. The 17-year-old, whose real name is William Connolly, went viral after he smashed an egg on far-right Senator Fraser Anning’s head during a political meeting on March 16. Anning proceeded to punch the teen several times in the head before his entourage of supporters tackled the teenager to the ground and put him in a headlock. The whole series of events was caught on camera and received 2 million views within just a few hours of being posted. The egging incident came after Anning released a statement blaming Muslims and immigration for the March 15 terrorist attack on Christchurch’s Islamic community that left 50 people dead. Instead of blaming the far-right terrorist who committed the attack, he said in his statement that “the real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” Ever since he cracked the egg that divided the nation, Melbourne teenager Will Connolly, better known as #EggBoy, has been both vilified and dubbed the “hero of the Earth”. Will approached us to set the record straight. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/31VogQPs5C — The Project (@theprojecttv) March 25, 2019 Despite going viral, Connolly remained mostly silent until this week. Speaking to Australian talk show “The Project” on Monday, March 25, Connolly acknowledged that even though cracking an egg over a senator’s head was not the right thing to do, the egging “united people.” He said he initially attended the political meeting to see if Anning “could change my mind,” and only after an hour of listening to the senator speak did he make his decision. “I’m a pretty forgiving person and in my mind, I wanted to forgive him, but then he started saying some more things.”  When asked why he thought the senator deserved an egging, he answered: “After that tragedy in Christchurch, I thought the world should be supporting all those victims.”  He continued, “The Senator released a statement that was pretty much a divisive hate speech blaming the victims for the attack — and I was just flat-out disgusted.”  When asked if he was an activist of any kind, Connolly replied: “I don’t know much about politics at all, I’m not pro any specific religion, I’m just pro-humanity.” He added he is not a member of any political party or organization.  Some criticized his actions following the incident, saying there is no room for any kind of violence in political discourse and the act drew attention away from those affected by the Christchurch terror attack. When asked whether there is ever a good reason to physically attack a politician, he said, “There’s no reason to physically attack anyone,” and he “can understand why some people reacted the way they did.”  Connolly elaborated, “I understand what I did was not the right thing to do; however, this egg has united people and money has been raised, tens of thousands of dollars has been raised for those victims.”  A GoFundMe was created for Connolly to help raise funds to cover any legal fees and buy “more eggs.” The fundraiser raised over AUD 80,000 (US $57,000) and Connolly received yet more admiration after he pledged to donate all funds to those affected by the Christchurch attack. Connolly was also offered a Ferrari, a holiday to Turkey, free tickets from famous bands, and a lifetime supply of beer among other gifts.  The 17-year-old said the attention he has received since the incident was completely unexpected, and it has not been easy for him. “I didn’t think this was going to blow up, it’s blown up completely out of proportion.” Connolly received applause worldwide for his especially proactive response to Anning’s Islamophobia. One Muslim teenager, while standing in front of a hospital in Christchurch, told Buzzfeed News, “Did you see that video of the Queensland senator being hit by an egg? That made my day.” “It’s a bit embarrassing actually because too much attention is actually being brought away from the real victims suffering, we should be focusing on them. I was just going to show my mates, it was just going to be a few laughs,” Connolly recounted. He said being called Egg Boy was actually starting to annoy him, and that funnily enough, he had been called Egg Boy at school even before the famous incident. “I’d eat boiled eggs at lunch and all the girls would be like ‘get away from me, that reeks,’” he said. “I’m off the eggs now, officially off the eggs.”     To my family, friends and people around the world, I would like to thank everyone for all the overwhelming support. I’m so proud to stand for what is right and I encourage everyone to stand up for what you all believe in. I do not condone violence and I do not condone egging someone, and everyone has a right to an opinion, but as I listened to Senator Anning for over an hour, I realised a point had to be made and if no one was going to do anything, then I was. I’m so humbled to be able to shed more light in response to the Christchurch shootings. My heart goes out to all who are suffering. I’ve had one lady from Christchurch tell me that through this period of darkness in her life, it’s the first time she’s smiled since the shootings, which meant so much to me. The main focus here has to be the people who are suffering and the issue at hand, and I’m really happy it has united people the way it has. I will continue to try and make the world a better place and I hope the end of racism is on the horizon. Keep spreading the love ❤️. Will Connolly A post shared by  will Connolly (@willconnolly__) on Mar 25, 2019 at 1:28am PDT Connolly also released a statement on Instagram following his talk show appearance, thanking people for their overwhelming support and encouraging others to “stand up for what you all believe in.” He added that he does “not condone violence and I do not condone egging someone, and everyone has a right to an opinion, but as I listened to Senator Anning for over an hour, I realized a point had to be made and if no one was going to do anything, then I was.” He reiterated that now should be a time to focus on the victims. “I’ve had one lady from Christchurch tell me that through this period of darkness in her life, it’s the first time she’s smiled since the shootings, which meant so much to me. The main focus here has to be the people who are suffering and the issue at hand, and I’m really happy it has united people the way it has.” While many believed Anning’s reaction to punch the teen several times in the face was unjustified, Anning said it was simply self-defense. “He got a slap across the face, which is what his mother should have given him long ago, because he’s been misbehaving badly,” Senator Anning said. “When someone cracks you on the back of the head you react and defend yourself. That for years is what Australians have been doing. Luckily they did that in the trenches and otherwise we’d all be speaking German now.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison disagreed though, saying Anning should “face the full force of the law” for his violent reaction. Anning has only doubled down on his divisive statements since the attack, saying, “Countries that allow large-scale immigration invariably have an escalation in crime, violence and terrorist attacks. Now, as far as I’m concerned, that’s just a statement of fact.”  World leaders condemned Fraser Anning’s statement, with New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern simply describing the comments as a “disgrace.”  Scott Morrison said Anning’s words were “disgusting” and, “Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.”

Rabat – The Moroccan American Network will host its fourth Business Forum – CEO Summit at the Willard InterContinental Hotel, in Washington, D.C. The summit will focus on small business opportunities between the US and Africa. The day of the event corresponds with “Morocco Day,” celebrated March 29. In 2018, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed March 29 as “Morocco Day” following a formal resolution by the D.C. Council.  “Morocco Day is an opportunity to explore economic, cultural, and educational exchange opportunities that are mutually beneficial for the Kingdom of Morocco and the United States of America,” according to Antoine Battle, CEO of Diplomatic Communications. Establishing Morocco Day in D.C. was just the “first step in a long and ambitious journey to strengthen Morocco’s position in the United States of America,” said Mohamed El Hajjam, the President of the Moroccan American Network. The Business Forum-CEO Summit will be attended by members of the Royal Cabinet of Morocco, D.C. Government, the US Black Chambers, the National US-Arab Chamber of Commerce, think tank experts, academics, and business leaders. “The summit is designed to expand opportunities for conducting business in Africa, and we are honored to have the city of Zagora, Morocco as a guest of honor, representing Morocco’s Eighth Region,” El Hajjam said. “Specifically, we want to highlight opportunities for greater collaboration and exchange of ideas, promoting foreign investment and economic growth.” The Morocco delegation will include Mohamed El Rherrass, state secretary to the minister of national education for vocational training, higher education and scientific research; Abderrahim Chahid, president of the Provincial Council of Zagora; Hmad Ayt Baha, MP; and Mohammed Elansari, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Draa-Tafilalet region. The official recognition of Morocco Day in Washington, D.C., reflects recognition by lawmakers and American citizens of Morocco’s long-standing relationship with the United States. El Hajjam said that the Moroccan American Network has a strategy to celebrate Morocco Day by recognizing one of Morocco’s twelve regions each year. This year, the event is celebrating the city of Zagora in the Draa-Tafilalet region. The Moroccan American Network creates opportunities for small businesses in the United States, Morocco, and Africa. The organization hosts forums, dialogue and events to educate the American public, media, and government about business and investment opportunities in the region. The network also sponsors exchange trips between the US and Morocco.

Rabat – A declassified document has revealed that Morocco’s proposal for a mutually acceptable settlement in Western Sahara was an American initiative in the first place. The US has been a staunch Moroccan ally on Western Sahara and plans to remain so even as it seeks to navigate the complexities of the conflict in Western Sahara, the document suggests. Titled “Sahara Policy History,” the seven-page document, which appears to have been written by the former Moroccan ambassador to Washington, Aziz Mekouar, shed light on previously unknown US support for Morocco’s Western Sahara claims. Morocco’s position in Western Sahara has in the last decade insisted that only through a “realistic” and “feasible” compromise-based solution can the Sahara dispute be brought to an end. Rabat laid that principle out in a 2007 document that has come to be known as the “Autonomy Plan.” The idea is to advance local Sahrawi autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. But according to the declassified document, the plan was conceived at the US’ request. “To solve the problem” in Western Sahara, the declassified document noted, “Morocco proposed in 2007, at American urging, a plan for a very broad autonomy for the region.” After that straightforward revelation in the introduction, the document provided a full roadmap of the events and people that contributed to the writing and adoption of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. It explained, “The present state of play on this issue is a direct result of an American initiative in 1999 to change course on how best to resolve the problem. The abandonment of the referendum option has been an American policy initiative, not a Moroccan one, and it took a very difficult internal political debate for Morocco to follow the American request to propose autonomy for the Sahara.” When the UN brokered a ceasefire between the Polisario Front and Morocco in 1991, the initial move was to station a peacekeeping mission—MINURSO—in the disputed territories until the conflicting parties could reach an agreement on referendum. By 1998, however, a series of failed attempts to prepare the ground for the promised referendum prompted stakeholders to realize it was a doomed idea because of fundamental disagreements between Morocco and Polisario over who should be allowed to vote. Faced with a political and procedural stalemate, the US State Department took the initiative in December 1998 to produce a “policy review” on how to best end the diplomatic gridlock. The review, which saw the contribution of the US ambassador in Rabat, Edward Gabriel, and the embassy’s political counselor, Bob Holley, concluded that the referendum option was a “dead end,” according to the declassified document. Having abandoned the referendum alternative, the US urged for a “political solution” brokered on the basis of a “negotiated, political solution to the problem.” Important in the move was the idea that the negotiated solution would be based on “continued Moroccan sovereignty in the Sahara, but with the granting of a broad and substantial (by international standards) autonomy for the territory,” according to the declassified document. Even as the Clinton administration presented its conclusions to King Hassan II, convincing him of the viability of the “broad autonomy” option in contrast to the impossibility of a referendum, the Moroccan monarch did not immediately approve of the move. “He lacked confidence that Algeria would be prepared to bargain in good faith on such a compromise – nor was it clear that he had much confidence in the willingness or ability of the United States to become a full partner in bringing Algeria to this point of view,” the document said of the King’s initial skepticism. By July 1999, the King, having apparently reached an agreement with Algeria’s newly emerging strong man, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, that “a solution along the lines of the American proposal was now possible,” the Moroccan monarch finally agreed to the proposal. But he died three days after agreeing to the proposal. King Mohammed VI, who replaced his father in 1999, was quickly briefed on the pending proposal. After the new King green-lighted the plan, the next move was to associate the UN mission in Western Sahara with what the US believed was the most effective way of ending the longstanding dispute in Western Sahara. Senior American diplomats subsequently briefed James Baker, who was then the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara. Baker, the document notes, “agreed with the approach and undertook to shape a proposal with Morocco that was consistent with the sovereignty/autonomy approach.” In the spring of 2000, Baker met with King Mohammed VI to discuss the proposal. Baker said after the meeting that he was convinced of the new Moroccan King’s genuine desire to commit to “an internationally acceptable autonomy arrangement for the people of the Sahara, under Moroccan sovereignty.” In 2001, Baker proposed a settlement plan known as “the Framework Agreement,” consistent with the US-inspired autonomy plan and hours of behind-the-door negotiations with Moroccan diplomats. Morocco accepted Baker’s proposal, but Algeria and Polisario vehemently opposed it. After that first initial failure and subsequent difficulties in passing a settlement proposal at the UN Security Council, Baker “secretly negotiated another proposal with Algeria and the Polisario Front, which he eventually tabled in 2003 as ‘the Peace Plan.’” The plan brought back the referendum option to the table. But Morocco, taken aback by the sudden change in Baker’s move, categorically rejected the “Peace Plan.” However, because of “Baker’s great prestige both in New York and in Washington, there was considerable confusion as to whether he spoke for himself only, or for the new Administration,” the declassified document noted. Those doubts ended in September 2003 after King Mohammed VI met with US President George Bush. President Bush told the King that Baker was not a US official, implying that the UN official’s actions on the Sahara question had nothing to do with the official US position. Bush promised the King that his administration would commit to the action plan Morocco had agreed to with the Clinton administration, urging the King to go ahead and put together the autonomy plan. With inputs from US officials, Morocco produced its “Autonomy Plan” and presented it to the UN in 2007. The US was among the first countries that saluted the Moroccan proposal, calling it “serious and credible.” Seeing that the US was siding with Rabat, Baker resigned from his UN position. While many of the events highlighted in the declassified document were already public knowledge, the information that Washington was the originator comes at a politically-charged time as the UN pushes for a sustainable settlement to the dispute. In line with the latest UN move to revert back to supporting Morocco after months of wavering commitment, the news of the US requesting the autonomy proposal is bound to ditch many speculations that have surrounded the international politicking in Western Sahara. Meanwhile, the declassified document suggested that Morocco continues to wait for the day when the US will publically reiterate its support for Morocco’s Western Sahara claims. But the news of the US helping in the entire process of what has become Morocco’s trademark on the Sahara dossier is also set to comfort Morocco in its growing confidence that only its position will stand the test of realism and political pragmatism. Morocco is already convinced that its proposal is more feasible and more in line with UN requirements than Polisario’s position is. With the unpredictability that has fraught the Trump administration, however, it remains to be seen whether the current, or the subsequent, US administration will provide Morocco with what other US administrations simply flirted with: Disclosed and full support for Morocco’s Western Sahara position.

Rabat – Morocco has reportedly requested the postponement of a visit planned by Romanian Senate President Calin Popescu Tariceanu to the North African country. Sources told Romanian outlet G4 Media that the Moroccan government might have canceled the meeting due to a busy agenda. “The Moroccan side has transmitted via diplomatic channels that it was not available for meetings.” The news outlet reported that Tariceanu’s official visit to Morocco was scheduled for March 27-31. “It was postponed at the request of the Moroccan party, to be reprogrammed for a later period, to be agreed upon.” Morocco’s alleged decision followed the announcement of King Abdullah II of Jordan that he would cancel his visit to Romania this week. He visited Morocco instead in response to Romania’s Prime Minister Viorica Dancila announcing plans to move her country’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan News Agency (Petra) said, “The decision came in solidarity with Jerusalem, following Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila’s remarks on Sunday.” Following King Abdullah’s cancellation, Morocco’s news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) announced that the Jordanian monarch changed his destination to Morocco. MAP reported that the Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery said that King Mohammed VI will meet King Abdullah II to hold official talks. Morocco’s alleged decision to postpone the Romanian official’s visit to Morocco King Abdullah’s cancellation of his visit to Romania suggest that both monarchs will discuss the Palestinian cause and US President Donald Trump’s proclamation recognizing Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights. According to G4 Media, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis criticized Dancila, accusing her of being “responsible for canceling King Abdullah II’s visit to Romania, who felt personally offended by her statements on the relocation of Israel’s Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.” “The prime minister shows complete ignorance regarding foreign affairs,” said Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

Rabat – A Casablanca court will announce its verdict in the final appeal for the convicted Hirak Rif activists, including Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, on Friday, April 5.   In a Facebook post, Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, shared a letter from the imprisoned Hirak activists reiterating their rejection of “marginalization, opportunism, political and economic corruption,” and their call for justice, dignity, integrity, and freedom. Although the Moroccan state rejected accusations of violence against the Hirak activists, the Hirak detainees insisted in their letter that “hundreds of [them] were subjected to torture,” and “unfair trials and sentences.” The Hirak activists attended their appeal hearing last January 14, but Zefzafi condemned the “absence of fair trial conditions” and vowed to boycott the rest of his appeal hearings.  Quoted by his father, Zefzafi had said, “[The trial] is but a stage play by the judicial institution … Therefore, I declare to the local, national and international public that I am boycotting this trial, in which the most basic conditions of fairness do not exist.” Responding to torture allegations by Amnesty International, Moroccan authorities said earlier this month in a statement that the NGO did not provide any evidence for its conclusion in its reports about the Hirak case. Moroccan authorities condemned Amnesty International’s statements twice. The first time was in January when the ministry said that the NGO’s position was “blatant interference” and a “clear violation of the most basic international standards.” Amnesty had said then that “Morocco’s judicial authorities must ensure the appeal trial does not descend into another charade marred by torture complaints and other fair trial violations.” Amnesty also condemned the heavy sentences activists received. In June 2018, a Casablanca court handed down sentences varying from 1 to 20 years to 54 Hirak activists for participating in the “unauthorized” Hirak protests. Nasser Zefzafi received 20 years. Between 2016 and 2017, police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the Hirak Rif protests in northern Morocco. The movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, an Al Hoceima fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities.  The incident caused citizens across Morocco, but particularly in the Rif region, to rise in major protests against social disparities in Morocco.

Rabat – The Moroccan and Malagasy foreign ministries have signed a cooperation agreement to enhance gender equality and an agreement on youth and sports cooperation. Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Malagasy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andriantsitohaina Franck Michel Naina signed nine agreements in total on Tuesday, March 26, during the first session of the Morocco-Madagascar Joint Cooperation Committee in Marrakech. Bourita and Naina signed agreements on the promotion of gender equality, combating sexual discrimination in education and the job market, and preventing violence against women. Madagascar may have useful experience to share with Morocco regarding gender equality. In the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Gender Gap Report, Madagascar ranked 84th out of 149 countries, whereas Morocco ranked 137th. The report focuses on the gender gap between men and women across four key areas: Health, education, economy, and politics. According to the the OECD Development Centre’s Social Institutions and Gender Index, Madagascar enshrined equality between the sexes in its constitution and amended its family code to raise the age of marriage from 14 for women and 17 for men to 18 for both sexes in 2007.  In a 2019 World Bank analysis, however, Morocco scored slightly better (73.13) than Madagascar (71.88). The analysis studied women’s freedom of movement, laws affecting women’s decisions to enter the labor market, laws affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage gap, and protection from sexual harassment. In September 2018, Morocco implemented Law 103-13, which criminalizes violence and sexual discrimination against women and can bring up to one year imprisonment, for example, in cases of street harassment of forced underage marriage. The two countries also signed action programs on youth and sports for the next two years, allowing people to take part in artistic and cultural events. It will also facilitate access for Malagasy students and teaching staff to use sports training institutes in Morocco. The committee’s first session also saw the signing of cooperation agreements and MOUs on diplomat training, scientific research, scholarships, internships, urban planning and housing policy, and decentralization.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior has said it will “firmly” address all illegal practices that threaten public safety and order in a statement about the contractual teachers’ sit-in overnight Saturday, March 23. The ministry’s statement, published on March 26, also dealt with the security forces’ response to the protest.  The ministry argued that security forces’ use of water cannon to disperse protesters “was proportionate and respected all legal provisions far from the fabricated images conveyed on social networks.” Stating that the government has responded positively to contractual teachers’ demands, the ministry condemned their continued protesting and rejection of the government’s offers. The contractual teachers are now in their fourth week of protests. The ministry stated that security forces conducted a direct dialogue with the protestors to end the overnight sit-in in front of Parliament at midnight before firing water cannons to disperse them.  Security forces fired the water cannons to prohibit acts violating public order, according to the statement. The statement added that the local authority offered to transport protesters to their respective cities and provide accommodation. The demonstrators rejected the proposal and continued to protest until 2:30 a.m. on Sunday. Although police attempted to disperse the protesters, some of the protesters “persisted in their practices of incitement and provocation of the public forces,” throwing stones and bottles and injuring 21 police officers and five members of the auxiliary forces, the statement concluded. Morocco’s Ministry of Higher Education has proposed reforms to improve contractual teachers’ work situation. The reform would give contractual teachers the same labor protection as permanent teachers, health care, a pension fund, early retirement in case of a permanent sickness, and the right to promotions to posts with greater responsibilities. Contractual teachers are employed for a fixed term within regional academies. Compared to permanent teachers who are employed as regular government employees, contractual teachers are entitled to a smaller pension after retirement. Although they receive the same salary, contractors are paid by the academies with whom they have contracted.

Rabat – Moroccan-French comedian Yassine Belattar is under police custody in Paris’s fifth arrondissement for allegedly making death threats and for sexual harassment in the workplace, according to AFP news agency sources. Belattar, a dual-nationality radio host, went to the police station Tuesday morning after a preliminary investigation into his conduct opened in late January, Le Monde reported. French comedian Bruno Gaccio had filed a complaint against Belattar for death threats. He said Belattar had threatened to attack his family, as French outlet Mediapart reported. Gaccio also filed a complaint for defamation, claiming Belattar called him a rapist during a public argument on social media. According to Mediapart, three other men in the entertainment industry also testified to police that Belattar threatened them with physical violence. “Many people spoke of humiliating or threatening behavior. Two women reported being sexually harassed while looking for a job,” the outlet added. It reported additional allegations of harassment, some made anonymously, others publicly, such as by television host Jessie Clair. In an investigation led by the news outlet, in which reporters had interrogated Yassine Belattar at length twice, one year apart, about the harassment charges, Mediapart concluded, “While he denies any accusation of ‘harassment’ at work, he is not hiding on the other hand that he usually uses words intended to frighten his interlocutors.” Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Belattar to the Presidential Council of Cities which focuses on priority neighborhoods.

Rabat – The United Nations has said it hopes all member states support its work in Western Sahara, after 37 African states reiterated their support for the UN’s exclusive role in mediating the Western Sahara conflict. The spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General, Stephane Dujarric, commented on the 37 countries’ decision in a press briefing on Tuesday, March 26. Of the 54 African countries, 37 states convened in Marrakech on Monday to make a declaration in support of the UN-led political process.  Asked if Antonio Guterres had a response to the declaration, Dujarric said, “The SG’s response is in the work and the effort of his Special Envoy, Mr. [Horst] Kohler, who you know just finished a latest round of discussions with the parties.” “We would hope that all Member States support the UN’s effort, as they are… as Mr Köhler’s efforts are being mandated by the Security Council,” added Dujarric. While the 37 countries reaffirmed the UN’s role at the Marrakech conference, several other states engaged in a symposium hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity. Algeria, and several other southern African countries attended the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi people in South Africa on March 25-26.South Africa and Namibia co-hosted the event. During the symposium, attended by Polisario Front leader Ibrahim Ghali, representatives discussed ways to solve the conflict by supporting the separatist principle of self-determination. By contrast, the 37 countries, which convened in Marrakech on Monday, reiterated support for the AU’s Decision 693 adopted in July 2018 at the 31st AU session in Nouakchott, Mauritania. The decision pushed back against efforts to mediate the conflict within the AU, affirming the UN as the only legitimate body to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

Rabat – Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most prevalent airborne diseases in Morocco, affecting more than 30,000 people every year, according to Moroccan Minister of Health Anas Doukkali. Following World Tuberculosis Day on March 24, Doukkali announced on Monday—during a national meeting to prepare an action plan to end tuberculosis in Morocco by 2030—that the annual TB case rate is 87 cases per 100,000 people. Tuberculosis is most likely to affect people aged 15 to 45. Pulmonary tuberculosis, a contagious bacterial infection of the lungs, makes up half of the TB cases in Morocco. Doukkali said that 70 percent of tuberculosis patients are from marginal neighborhoods near major cities like Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat, Sale, Kenitra, Marrakech, Safi, Fez, Meknes, the northern regions of Tetouan and Al Hoceima, and the southern Souss-Massa region.  According to the latest tuberculosis statistics, 86 percent of annual tuberculosis cases are found in those cities and regions which are home to 78 percent of the Moroccan population. Doukkali noted that Morocco’s national program has achieved positive results in diagnosing and successful treating tuberculosis. The rate of detection of the infectious disease, which enables early treatment, rose from 75 to 85 percent in Morocco since 1995, said Doukkali. In 2016, a total of 31,542 cases of tuberculosis were recorded in Morocco, according to the ministry. To limit the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health is allocating an annual sum that has more than doubled from MAD 30 million (over $3 million) in 2012 to MAD 76 million (over $7.8 million) in 2018. Doukkali rued that the global annual rate of tuberculosis infections did not decrease “despite the efforts of all world health organizations.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis, and 1.6 million people died from the disease worldwide in 2017. Tuberculosis is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the “Mycobacterium tuberculosis” bacteria that commonly affects the lungs. It is a contagious infection that spreads through the air from an infected patient’s coughs, sneezes, or spit.  “TB is a treatable and curable disease. Active, drug-susceptible TB disease is treated with a standard 6 month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs … Between 2000 and 2017, an estimated 54 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment,” says the WHO.

Rabat – Algerian journalist Hafid Derradji has criticized the “circumentive” statement of Algeria’s powerful National Army chief, Gaid Salah, who called on the Constitutional Council to remove President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power by implementing Article 102. Derradji took to his Facebook to comment on Salah’s statement, which shocked many Algerian citizens supporting the Algerian Hirak protest movement. The senior officer has long been known for his unwavering support for Bouteflika.   The beIN SPORTS journalist wrote: “Do they want Bouteflika’s departure and the continuation of the system?? Is the activation of Article 102 a constitutional solution or a coup against the will of the people?” According to Article 102, “whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” In a televised interview, Derradji questioned Gaid Salah’s capacity to make such statements. Since Salah resigned from political office and only holds a military position, Derradji asked, “With which capacity does the chief of staff speak?” He suggested that Gaid Salah cannot order the application of Article 102 because he is no longer deputy minister of defense. Derradji said that the Constitution clearly asks the army to stay out of politics under any circumstances. Against Algerians demands? Derradji then asked if there is a “consensus” between the chief of staff and Said Bouteflika, Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s brother, who has long been accused by political observers of controlling the Algerian regime. “President Bouteflika left a long time ago in my opinion,” said Derradji, asking whether there is a “consensus for what can be saved.” Before the interview, Derradji said that Gaid Salah could not have commented without Said Bouteflika’s knowledge. “His intervention can be seen as a way to block the proposal of temporary presidential council to oust the chief of staff. People have the right to be suspicious, to doubt and fear you because you made us used to not trust you even if you give up,” wrote Derradji. Derradji also recalled when Salah himself was among the majority who supported Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term. He added that Salah was among the group who submitted a file with a medical certificate to prove that Bouteflika was qualified to run for president again. “How can he be eligible a few weeks ago and is not qualified today? These are the existing contradictions,” the journalist concluded. It is not the first time Derradji commented on Algeria’s hirak, the popular movement against the “pouvoir,” or the system. In February, Derradji criticized Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term before his decision to step down. Derradji wrote that people in Algeria “started feeling ashamed.” “Bouteflika did not run, nor can he make his candidacy, nor campaign, nor even swear in,” said Derradji, doubting Bouteflika’s ability to perform “his constitutional duties.”

Rabat –  Themis, a Morocco-based electricity company, has concluded a partnership with the Kingline Development Nigeria company to build a natural gas electricity plant in Ondo State Industrial Park in southern Nigeria. Themis and Kingline expect the new power plant, called the Kinglinge Power Project, to be one of the world’s “lowest cost gas-to-power facilities.” Themis, backed by the international Denham Capital equity firm, will provide funding in the $600 million project. Tas Anvaripour, CEO of the Casablanca-based power supplier Neo Themis, stated, “Kingline offers compelling advantages for the Federal Government of Nigeria given its extremely competitive pricing, availability of peripheral gas and transmission infrastructure, timing to operation, and technical flexibility.” Kingline plans to sell 4.5 terawatts per hour of electricity to the state-run electricity company when the project becomes fully operational by 2022, according to Business Day. The project includes a 550 megawatt combined cycle powerhouse, a substation, a desalination facility, and related infrastructure. With the aim to support power projects in Africa, Neo Themis was set up in 2018 to launch the Africa Power Investment Platform under a partnership between Themis and Denham Capital. Nigeria currently has an operational capacity of 4,000 megawatts. However, it has 13,400 megawatts at maximum capacity and 15,000 megawatts of demand. Kingline’s CEO Sean Kim expressed his excitement at working with Themis: “The Project has strong technical and financial support and will deliver a powerful solution for Nigeria, cost-competitive within any international market.” In May 2017, Morocco and Nigeria partnered to build the Gazoduc project linking Nigeria to Morocco through a gas pipeline. The pipeline would benefit over 300 million people. The project aims to speed up electrification projects in West Africa and create competition in the region. However, the progress of the project is facing challenges, according to a study conducted by Fetch Solutions. The project, it says, will face delays due to political and security concerns in the region. It said that the the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline will face “considerable commercial, technical, legal and financial challenges” making the project “unlikely to materialize in the short or medium-term.”

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Sale has sentenced the train driver in the Bouknadel train accident to time served, five months and five days, and a fine of MAD 500. The court announced the verdict on Tuesday, March 26. Police arrested the driver, Laarbi Rich, following an investigation after the train he was driving derailed on October 16, 2018, near Bouknadel, north of Rabat. Laarbi Rich was detained in prison on October 23, 2018, and prosecutors charged him with murder, accidental injuries, and driving the train over the speed limit.  The court president, El Malki Hizam, announced that Rich would only get a “time served” sentence equal to the time he had already spent in prison, five months and five days. Rich left the prison today. Rich’s defence threatened previously to sue the government for detaining him, saying there was no evidence to convict him. However, Rich was found guilty of homicide and unintentional injuries. The train derailment killed 7 people and left 125 injured. The charges carried punishments between five months and five years in prison and a fine of MAD 250 to 1,000, as stipulated by Acts 432 and 433 of the criminal code. The judge ordered medical examinations on the individuals injured before bringing a court case against the National Office of Railways (ONCF). A number of doctors have been designated to carry out the medical examinations. They will also determine the duration of the survivors’ disability. The judge has fixed April 26 as the deadline to submit the medical examinations. He also fixed May 7 as the date of the ONCF trial. Rich’s defence blamed ONCF for not communicating with the driver and for not providing the train with automatic braking nor a display screen. They also accused ONCF of breaching Article 58 of the criminal procedure code, arguing that some evidence was corrupted.

Rabat – Uber announced on Monday night that it will be paying $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes for full ownership of Dubai-based ride-hailing company Careem. The tech deal is the largest of the kind in the Middle East, overpassing Amazon’s acquisition of Souq for $580 million in 2017. The Careem brand will stay intact for now, and the cofounders of the company, Mudassir Sheikha, Magnus Olsson, and Abdulla Elyas are staying on with Careem, the companies said. However, the structure of Careem’s board will change. Three seats will go to Uber representatives and the remaining two to Careem. Uber has previously operated in Morocco, launching in Casablanca in June 2015, but it halted operations just three years later due to local regulations. As Morocco only allows taxis to register as a legitimate service, Uber was operating in a legal gray area simply connecting independent drivers and passengers through its application.  In an official statement, Uber explained that their decision to stop operating was due to the lack of “clarity about integrating applications like Uber into the existing transport model.”  Uber also faced backlash from taxi drivers, who said the service was unfairly undercutting them. Tensions between taxi drivers and Uber drivers even escalated into violence, with numerous incidents being reported of intimidation, threats, car chases, and Uber vehicles being vandalized.  Uber said in its statement that “the current regulatory uncertainty does not allow us to provide a safe and reliable experience that meets the requirements of our customers, both drivers and passengers.” Careem was founded in March 2012 in Dubai and currently serves over 100 cities in 14 countries in the Middle East, Southern Asia, and Africa, including Morocco. Even though Careem was in an identical position to Uber when it launched in Morocco, the company pushed through the criticism and gained popularity.  Careem estimated it had 300,000 users in Morocco in 2018, whereas Uber only had 19,000 users in Morocco at its peak before terminating its services. Uber’s acquisition of Careem comes during a difficult time for the company. Uber booked a $1.8 billion loss in 2018, and exited China, Russia, and eight Southeast Asian countries, selling its business in the regions to homegrown startups similar to Careem. The acquisition of Careem is pending regulatory approval and is expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2020.

Rabat – After weeks of protests by contractual teachers, Omar Balafrej, an MP of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), stated in an interview with Moroccan news outlet Walaw that employing teachers under a fixed-term contract is “nonsense.” Contractual teachers have staged a number of strikes across Morocco over recent weeks demanding to be integrated into the public sector.  The government has hired teachers under annually renewable contracts every year since 2016.To fill the need for more teachers while managing heavy public debts, the government hired the teachers through regional academies. The contractual teachers’ unions are protesting the government’s alleged inability to meet their demands to be hired into the public sector and provide free public education. Hinting at the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) and the opposition Istiqlal (Independence) Party (PI), Balafrej, whose PSU belongs to the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD), argued that those who own private schools do not want to reform the education system because reform threatens their interests. “These people,” stated Balafrej, “belong to powerful political parties like the PJD and the PI.” He continued, “Some MPs even call for privatizing education even in marginalized and rural areas.” Approximately 1 million students from middle-class families attend private school in Morocco, generating a profit of  MAD 10 billion, according to Balafrej. Balafrej argued that some private sectors should be nationalized, citing Sweden as an example of a country with a 0 percent rate of private schooling at primary and secondary levels and Turkey as a country with a 1 percent rate. According to a 2015 report conducted by several Moroccan organizations, beginning with the implementation of the National Charter for Education and Training (NCET), Morocco has been promoting private education. The charter states that “the private education and training sector is considered as a main partner, alongside the State, in the promotion of the education and training system, the broadening of its extension and the continuous improvements of its quality.” The solution, Balafrej proposes, is that the government should improve the public school system. Private school should not be a necessity but an option, he said.  “What we need to do is to show a strong willingness to hold out against lobbyists of the private sector. Public education is not only about employment under fixed contracts,” Balafrej stressed. In sympathy with contractual teachers, the National Syndicate of Higher Education (SNESup) declared that they are going to protest at the Ministry of Education in Rabat on Thursday, April 17. In a special meeting on March 23, SNESup also decided to go on another nation-wide strike but has not decided when. Their statement calls for an open dialogue between contractual teachers and the government regarding the teachers’ demands, particularly to increase the wages of researcher-teachers especially because of the high cost of living.

Rabat – Algeria’s powerful National Army senior officer, Ahmed Gaid Salah, has called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down and for the Constitutional Council to implement Article 102, allowing for the removal of an incapacitated president. Salah, who was Bouteflika’ closest ally, said on Tuesday, March 26, in a speech broadcast on state television that the way to solve Algeria’s “crisis” is to apply Article 102 of the Constitution. “We must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework that is the only guarantee to preserve a stable political situation,” Salah said. Salah’s statement followed his comments earlier in March when he said that the military and the people share a “united vision” of their country’s future, where Bouteflika is not in power. While Bouteflika withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term on March 11, he insisted on delaying the April 18 elections, effectively extending his fourth term indefinitely. Bouteflika plans to hold a “national conference” to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. Bouteflika’s party itself,  the National Liberation Front (FLN), rejected his idea to hold a national conference, telling Algerian television channel Dzair News that is no longer a “valid”one. Since February 22, hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting in the anti-Bouteflika demonstrations, including students, judges, lawyers, unions, and many others.

In their coverage of the visit, pro-Polisario outlets boasted about the US’ Senate being on the side of the “Sahrawi cause.” That misreading of the US position in the conflict came straight from Senator James Inhofe’s comments at a news conference after the delegation’s meeting with the Polisario leadership. A known devotee to the Polisario’s Western Sahara “cause” and the sitting chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Inhofe led the 17-member delegation which subsequently met with high-profile Algerian and Sahrawi officials, including the self-styled president of the Polisario-administered territories Brahim Ghali. “President Trump’s commitment to the freedom of this people that he will undoubtedly recover,” he said. Infusing his statements with the usual Morocco-damning tropes of “colonization,” “occupation,” referendum, and self-determination,” Inhofe said that his visit to the camps was a reflection of his struggle alongside downtrodden and disenfranchised Sahrawis for human rights and dignity. The US, the UN, and the entire international community, he explained, should wait no longer to make Morocco bow to international laws and principles. The “Sahrawi cause,” he explained, is one of rescuing a helpless people from the jaws of Morocco’s “colonial and repressive” regime. While the senatorial visit and the telling picture of the Inhofe-Ghali bromance did not pick up in Moroccan media outlets as expected, the Senator’s rhetoric is the kind of impetus that has been driving the pro-Polisario legions in the US and around the world. Buoyed up by perceived injustice, reported “daily violations of Sahrawi rights,” and a certain morality-flavored imperative to come to the rescue of the needy and the marginalized, the point of such statements is to increase the ranks of groups that self-describe as “Friends of Western Sahara.” Unchecked and readily believed, words and rhetoric such as Senator Inhofe’s become the center of gravity of the enduring appeal to save Sahrawis from “Moroccan colonization.” 
Evangelical activism When checked, however, does the Senator’s humanitarian-cloaked and liberation-energized plea hide something other than a principled commitment to helping the needy and the oppressed? Is Inhofe’s engagement on similar fronts consistent with his professed disinterested adherence to “self-determination and independence for Western Sahara?” The answer, according to scores of studies on US evangelists’ decades-long involvement with Sahrawis, is that the Senator’s fervor for Western Sahara has more to do with performance and ideology than principles. While the urge to assist and help is commendable on many grounds, Inhofe’s activism in favor of the Tindouf camps is the culmination of a perceived deal with the Polisario leadership. The suggestion is that, as a die-hard Evangelical Christian, the Oklahoma Senator is throwing his political weight behind the “Sahrawi cause” in order to help the decades-long Evangelical overtures in the camps—and the Sahrawi imaginary. The allegation is heavy, perhaps even discourteous; it supposes that Senator Inhofe’s indictment of Morocco’s Western Sahara position is more about ideological posturing than genuine protestation. But such allegations are not without precedent. Over the years, researchers have used expressions like “holly humanitarianism,” “disaster evangelism,” or faith-based humanitarianism, among the most widely circulated, to explain the presence in Western Sahara of religion-driven donors and sympathizers like James Inhofe. Since establishment in 1976, the Tindouf camps have exclusively depended on material and financial assistance from the UN-linked organizations and a number of secular and faith-based NGOs. Documenting the ways in which donors navigate the needs of Tindouf refugees, a number of studies have nearly unanimously established that “Holy humanitarians” have historically engaged in activities other than providing assistance. Although religion can be a true “cataclysm for change,” anthropologist Marisa O Ensor remarked in her study of what she termed “disaster humanitarianism,” Evangelicals’ interest in “helping the victims of wars and natural disasters… has sometimes led to a form of bribery, promising material advantages to those who embrace the Gospel.” In the Western Sahara context, the Polisario leadership “ingratiates themselves” with Evangelists, green-lighting the former’ desire to establish churches in the camps and asking in return that they lobby in their favor in the US and on the international stage, according to Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, who has conducted some of the most insightful studies on the politics of Western Sahara-related humanitarian assistance.  The apparent deal between zealous evangelists like Senator Inhofe and the Polisario Front,” as Fiddian-Qasmiyeh put it in a 2012 working paper, is underpinned by each party’s avowed desire to advance its own interests. The paper documents Inhofe’s role as one of the most prominent figures among Western Sahara’s “American brothers and sisters,” groups of US evangelists who have organized numerous events in favor of the “Sahrawi cause,” including collective prayers and worship concerts. What’s in it for us? While UN and secular humanitarians generally limit themselves to discharging their duties as assistance providers, Evangelical humanitarians go beyond the primary goal of humanitarianism, coupling material assistance with spiritual and religious comfort. Rather than an instance of disinterested and unconditional support to “the Sahrawi cause” its proponents purport to fiercely espouse, evangelism-inspired assistance workers see in the Tindouf camps a fertile ground for proselytizing their faith. Help, therefore, is provided in the hope of medium to long term rewards: Conversion to Christianity of as many Sahrawis as possible. With “implicit and explicit conditionalities attached to the provision of aid,” Fiddian-Qasmiyeh wrote in another paper, assistance first and foremost follows the ideological priorities of the donors. Inhofe, a key member of the mainly Republican-composed US Senate Defense Forum Foundation known for its pro-Polisario sympathy, has no qualms about lobbying for the pro-Polisario claims at the US Congress. Referring to one of his numerous visits to the camps, Senator Inhofe said before Congress in 2009, “I strongly support the independence movement of the Saharawi people of Western Sahara, which demands the fulfillment of a 1991 United Nations resolution calling for a referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara.” He went on to invoke alleged human rights abuse by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara, brandishing his total adherence to the principle of “self-determination and the right to return.” The problem with the senator’s position, or the obvious religious underpinnings of his human rights-saturated discourse in the Sahara context, is that he loses his ardor for international law principles when taking stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Unlike in Western Sahara, where the UN Security Council does not refer to the disputed territories as “occupied” and where there is disagreement over who “the authentic Sahrawis” are, there is a fairly robust agreement in the Palestine-Israel case over the status of Gaza and the West Bank. Speaking at the US Congress in 2002, however, Senator Inhofe voraciously lamented any UN “imposition” on Israel to depart from a land that is “its historic right.” In a speech filled with overtly biblical references, the senator went on to give “7 reasons why Israel is entitled to the land.” This remarkable change of discourse, experts have argued, boils down to the fact that it is ideology—religious or political—rather than adherence to human rights principles, that governs the politics of Western-Sahara bound humanitarian assistance in many circles. Fiddian-Qasmiyeh describes this practice as “selective inclusion,” implying that, in many instances, humanitarian assistance—financial, material, and logistical—is provided insofar as the recipients adhere to the politico-religious conditions imposed by the donors. Another pro-Western Sahara recruitment trope in Evangelical circles is the religious idealization, or romanticization, of the Tindouf camps. In the evangelical vocabulary, Tindouf is not only a site with people in need of external succor. Rather, it is a non-Christian place incredibly welcoming to Christian ethics and values, which also makes it a place where Christianity can establish itself and potentially thrive. Chief in this narrative is the perception that despite its authorities’ insistence on religious tolerance and a history of peaceful accommodation of faiths other than Islam, Morocco is far from being a bastion of inter-faith dialogue. The resulting idea is that Christianity will only thrive in Western Sahara when it is not part of Morocco, where Islam is the overwhelmingly dominant and visible religion. This was much obvious in March 2010, when Morocco expelled hundreds of American and European Evangelicals for proselytizing to orphan and abandoned children under their care in the village of Hope in the Fez region. Covering a similar incident in May of the same year, Christianity Today observed: “Six years ago, a delegation of evangelical leaders visited the Kingdom of Morocco and hailed it as ‘open to evangelical Christian outreach.’” With the expulsion of Christian missionaries, however, the outlet concluded, “The North African country is apparently open no more.” A 2004 feature article in the Christian Science Monitor hammered that point home in a far more telling pro-Polisario rhetoric. “Literacy and democracy are thriving in an unlikely place,” the article observed, referring to Tindouf camps. It added that the Sahrawi women are the “most liberated women of the Muslim world.” But that literacy and democracy thrived was merely the tip of the iceberg, according to the Christian Science Monitor, in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps’ espousal of values closer to those of Christianity. Enshrining religious tolerance and an individualistic approach to Islam, the camps are places where “mosques are conspicuously absent.” The reason for the absence of Islamic symbols in the camps, the article went on to argue, is because the majority of Sahrawis “don’t believe that to speak to God you need a fancy place.”
Even more important, one Sahrawi translator allegedly told the Christian Science Monitor reporter, each Sahrawi “has his own Islam.” Few things are as close to Evangelists’ hearts and view of religion as interpretations that put each believer’s individual relationship with God at the heart of the religious experience. The Polisario Front understands this, and has heavily capitalized on it. According to Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, the group frames its discourse in line with its perception of its supporters’ priorities and “normative preferences.” When dealing with American evangelists, the group foregrounds its tolerant and secular approach to religion. Meanwhile, Fiddian-Qasmiyeh notes, “the Polisario habitually centralizes Islam in interactions with Algerian authorities, whilst displacing Islam and mobilizing notions of shared experiences of colonial oppression and racism to secure support from the Cuban and South African governments.” Toward an end of the Western Sahara conflict? There has been a mounting impetus for a frank political dialogue to settle the Western Sahara dispute under the auspices of the UN Security Council. For the first time in decades, the UN-led process to settle the dispute has convinced Algeria and Mauritania to take part in negotiations and peace talks as full participants in the trust-building and settlement discussion process. The four stakeholders are just coming out of a UN-led roundtable in Geneva. UN diplomats have expressed resurging confidence in a prospective end to the dispute, despite perceptions that longstanding ideological fervor may obstruct the newfound optimism. As ideologies tend to simplify complex realities, ideologized accounts of any crisis, much less one as complex and historically multifaceted as the Sahara dispute, often tell partisan truths, reinforcing listeners or receivers’ already entrenched biases. “Western Sahara is and has always been part of Morocco….The ‘Sahrawi people’ does not exist. It is the creation of Algeria and a large part of the Spanish left which are still not ready to come to terms with the fact that the territories are Morocco’s,” Spanish politician Jorge Verstrynge Rojas, who is close to pro-Polisario circles in Spain, recently commented. Rojas’s point, as he went on to highlight, was that, in the Sahara crisis, a clash of competing ideologies and revolutionary zeal has finally sidelined historical validity, throwing it in the dustbin. As much as ideologies inform knowledge and decisions, they also obfuscate, oversimplify, and sometimes confuse otherwise straightforward matters. As history is twisted and facts become mere tools at the service of one’s own truth, Rojas seemed to suggest, Morocco still has a lot on its public relations plate in a world where it has become fashionable—and virtuous—to come to the rescue of the oppressed, or the wretched, no matter how historically or factually invalid their claims are. In a global order that fetishizes revolution, history easily becomes a casualty of the urgency to do something about anything. Amid the confusion, Rojas and some other analysts have suggested, the most effective answer to Western Sahara’s long-standing stalemate lies in foregrounding both historical context and deft diplomatic maneuvering. For Rojas and those who think like him, there is very little prospect of sustainable settlement for Western Sahara so long as ideological and revolutionary outbursts whitewash historical relevance and factual evidence. Given the international community’s increasingly genuine desire to once and for all broker a lasting and mutually acceptable political solution in Western Sahara, a reading such as Roja’s may be overly pessimistic—and unwelcome. Whatever scenario one pictures, however, noted Francois Delattre, France’s Ambassador to the UN, brokering the necessary compromises will take time. “I think one of the lessons in diplomacy, and on this issue in particular, is each step at a time,” Delattre said during meetings to prepare the second Geneva meeting.

Rabat – Even without En-Nesyri, Hakim Ziyech, and Nordin Amrabat, three foundational elements in this Herve Renard-coached and somewhat good-looking Morocco, the Atlas Lions did produce a rather satisfying and confidence-boosting football against a Messi-less Argentina. But it is highly doubtful whether the quality of the game the lions produced will soothe Moroccans. Two consecutive goalless displays have brought to light what Morocco Atlas Lions mostly seem to lack: A sense of urgency and the guts to grab the defining moments when given the opportunity to do so. If anything, tonight was a hugely underwhelming performance from both sides, leaving supporters from both camps disappointed that a game that had garnered so much passion and so many talking points was after all not as stellar as supporters may have hoped. There was nothing particularly soporific about the 90 minutes of football in Tangier, but neither were there moments of ecstatic display that could live up to the pre-match fervor and excitement. With most of the ball possession and a far greater passing accuracy, Morocco looked set for an upset, something that seemed quite doable given that Argentina were clueless and unthreatening without the genius of Lionel Messi. The first half hour, as though a carefully choreographed display from Morocco’s Lions latest game in Malawi, was rife with moments of confidence and promising brilliance. But that brilliance never really came. In the absence of Ziyech, Belhanda, Achraf Hakimi, and Ziyech’s Ajax teammate Masraf Azraoui took it upon themselves to unsettle Argentina, playing with a level of confidence and mastery that quickly eclipsed Argentina’s starring player Paulo Dybala. But, as was the case late last week when facing Malawi, Morocco failed to make its domination count, missing the few opportunities that came its way in the first half. The first half’s most telling moment came down the right flank at the 22nd minute. A succulent combination between Belhanda and Hakimi caused riotous uproar inside the Tangier stadium, with Moroccan supporters obviously expecting a goal. But there again, once inside the Argentine zone, the Lions lacked the clinical edge needed to transform that beautiful footballing moment into a goal that would define the evening. Argentina replied in kind at the 24th minute, with a short-ranging strike from Rodriguez forcing the game’s first save from Morocco’s Yassine Bounou. But Argentina’s Roja were mostly unimpressive in the game, visibly out of ideas and inspiration, and perhaps waiting for an unlikely moment of grace. Passes were poor, while transitions were even more laughable. Without Messi, it seemed, Argentina plays like an ordinary team barely able to threaten its opponents. In the players’ defense, however, the weather may have been responsible for some of the game’s most lackadaisical displays. With an unruly, windy weather that made it impossible for many players to perform at their usual level, it is understandable that the game went the way it went: prosaic, awful, uneventful, and only marginally exciting towards the end. Of particular relevance here is the second half: Nothing remarkable, no outstanding moment. It was not only an extension, but a literal copy of the first half. Morocco kept playing beautiful but inconclusive football, while Dybala and company continued looking clueless. At least that was the impression until the last ten minutes. Collecting a gracious pass at the 84th minute, Angel Correa, who moments earlier had entered the game in replacement of Paulo Dybala, crossed the entire Moroccan defensive line with a deft touch before lodging the ball inside the Moroccan net. Bounou read the soft strike’s trajectory, but could do little to save it. After that late-minute goal, Morocco looked rejuvenated, now chasing an equalizer with a tempo and urgency than they had not even come close to evincing for more than eighty minutes. As both coaches look forward to collecting the wherewithal needed for prospective victory in their continental tournaments, tonight was certainly a test of nerve for both teams. In that regard, it is sensible to suggest that both teams left tonight’s game with notes that may serve them well en route to the tournaments they are preparing for. Argentina needs a working formula to get the most out of Messi in probably his last Copa America, whereas Morocco, for all their brilliance in passing and keeping the ball, are miles away from the finishing line required to secure the continental crown that has not been theirs since 1976.

Rabat – King Abdullah II of Jordan will spend a two-day visit in Morocco at the invitation of King Mohammed VI, March 27-28. The Ministry of the Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery said that King Mohammed VI would hold official talks with his royal guest. Two years have passed since King Abdullah II visited Morocco and discussed with King Mohammed VI political developments in the Arab world and the terrorist challenges the region faces. The two heads of state also agreed on the importance of mobilizing the international community to find solutions to Middle Eastern conflicts, including Palestine. King Abdullah II was due to arrive in Romania Monday but he canceled the visit on Monday in protest against Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila’s plan to move Romania’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On Sunday, Dancila said she was “pleased to announce” that Romania would “move our embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel.” She made the announcement at a conference in Washington, D.C., held by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent and influential pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States. Romanian President Klaus Lohannis rejected the Dancila’s announcement, saying that he is the only one who has the authority to do so. According to Jordan News Agency (Petra), the Jordanian sovereign was supposed to participate in the Aqaba Meetings, which Romania had been planning to host in partnership with Jordan. A Jordanian-Romanian Business Forum had been also planned with the participation of private sector representatives from both countries. The agency also reported that the Jordanian and Romanian governments had planned to sign one agreement, two memorandums of understanding, and a cooperation program. On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation to recognize Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights, a territory Israel seized from Syria in 1967. Trump’s decision received applause from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who commended the US for its decision at a joint press conference with Trump. Trump has been a close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu and recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017. Since then, a number of other countries followed suit, moving their embassies to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Both King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah of Jordan rejected Trump’s decision, emphasizing the status of the city as the future capital of the Palestinian state.

Rabat – The European members of parliament have voted in favor of ending the Daylight saving time (DST), with 410 voices in for and 192 against.  The vote results do not mean however that the EU countries will abolish the practice. Instead, concerned European countries will take it into consideration when making the decision. Since 2001, all EU countries have been using the DST, adding one hour on the last Sunday of March of each year and switching it back to standard time on the last Sunday of October. The goal of the practice of changing time twice yearly was to save energy. But studies have shown that DST has been detrimental to more damage to the health of people. Its contribution to increasing the amount of energy savings was marginal when compared with the mental troubles it caused among populations. The EU countries will now have the choice to whether stick with the summertime or keep the winter time. In Morocco, meanwhile, the daylight saving was supposed to end on Sunday, October 28, but Moroccans were taken aback by the government decision to stay in DST all year round. The move angered Moroccans who were used to move their clocks back by one hour every year on the last Sunday of October.  The government justified its move, saying that the decision was based on a study they conducted. The alleged study found that the “adoption of ‘doubling timing’ has created a kind of confusion,” according to the government. As 68 percent of Moroccans were against a permanent shift to using DST, the government explained that the decision is aimed to end changing time four times a year. Morocco goes back temporarily to GMT during the holy month of Ramadan. In recent months, speculations ran wild that Renault, and not the Moroccan government, was behind Morocco’s decision to maintain GMT+1. In a comment on LinkedIn, Chikhi Adib, the General Director of Altitude RH, a human resources consultancy, stated that Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn had come to Morocco to “personally demand” the permanent adoption of DST.

Rabat – It is unclear why the Algerian people waited for this moment to rise up, given that Bouteflika was already weakened by a stroke in 2013, and has been struggling to govern since.   Perhaps they were appeased by their relatively thriving economy which was heavily reliant on energy exports. Since oil prices began dropping drastically in 2014, Algeria’s reliance on oil has meant that its economy is becoming increasingly unsustainable.  The Algerian people are no longer willing to accept the paralysis of their leadership in the face of the challenges caused by the country’s stagnant economy, rising up in unprecedented numbers in recent weeks.  During the Arab Spring, a wave of anti-government protests that swept across the Arab world in 2010, the Algerian people did not demonstrate  for two main reasons.  The first reason is the scarring effects on the Algerian psyche of the Black Decade, a civil war between the government and Islamist rebel groups in the 1990s in which around 200,000 Algerians lost their lives.  The second reason is that political leaders  had promised democracy to the people once peace was achieved, but none of these promises were kept and although the people were well taken care of by the welfare state in terms of their basic needs, they had a dim view of the future and their aspirations were dulled by the limitations of what the state could offer them. Read Also: ‘Game Over’: Anti-Bouteflika Protests Resume in Algeria It is widely believed in Algeria that Bouteflika is a puppet of the military regime that governs Algeria with an iron fist. This regime finds its roots in the Liberation Army, which led the war of liberation against French colonialism.  After independence in 1962, the army withdrew from the political scene and gave revolutionary and socialist soldier Ahmed Ben Bella the opportunity to form a government and become the country’s first president.  Emboldened by the army’s trust and confidence in him, Ben Bella quickly forgot where the true power lay, and his flippant decisions soon antagonized Boumedienne, a heavyweight of the military, as well as his protégé, a young Bouteflika. In 1965, Boumeddienne seized power through a coup and brought the army to the forefront of the political scene, an institution whose leitmotif was and still is: “the use of revolutionary violence, if necessary, to remain in power.”  The Algerian army, unlike in the other countries of the region, functions like a powerful secret club headed by forty senior officers that rule the country behind the scenes. In 1991, the army’s dismissal of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), an Islamist political party who were victorious in the first round of parliamentary elections, pushed the country into a bloody civil war which is still known as the Black Decade.  In 1999, the army called on Bouteflika to get rid of the Islamist party by peaceful means. The secret of the ruling army’s longevity is undoubtedly their ability to bow and bend in order to eventually achieve their aims.  With the fall of Bouteflika, the army is continuing in this vein, making concession after concession to manage the Algerian people’s demands and unshakeable will. Their continued mass demonstrations have led the army to agree to withdraw Bouteflika’s candidacy, but the withdrawal has simply led to more political deception: In any case, the Algerian people will no longer stand for a government that doesn’t serve them. Doubtless, the mass protests are likely to continue in the face of the military’s undemocratic rule until Algerians have a government that they feel truly represents them.  Now, only time will tell if they will succeed in changing the face of Algerian politics and bringing about real change.

Rabat – The lawyers of Hassan Ennaciri, a Moroccan man living with his family in Spain, have denounced a Spanish court’s decision to expel him for drug dealing. The Spanish Provincial Court of Teruel in eastern Spain ordered the expulsion of Ennaciri, a Moroccan father of three, after he was sentenced to three years in jail in 2016 on charges of selling cocaine and “endangering public health.” In the same year, a court changed the sentence and ordered his expulsion from Spain, which it only implemented on March 9. According to one of the lawyers, Antonio Perez, Ennaciri’s family was shocked to learn on Monday that authorities took him from the Foreigners Detention Center (CIE) in Valencia, eastern Spain, toward Algeciras—a city in southern Spain connected to Morocco by passenger ferry. Ennaciri was transferred in compliance with an “immediate” expulsion order although he had appealed the earlier 2016 expulsion order. Ennaciri’s current whereabouts are not known yet. The lawyers deemed the court’s expulsion order abrupt and “illegal” because the court did not expel him within the first two years of making the order and did not review his case. Meanwhile, sources in the Valencian government delegation told Spanish news agency EFE that authorities originally made the expulsion order at the request of Ennaciri himself who had chosen to replace the three-year prison sentence with expulsion. Born in Morocco, Ennaciri had lived in Alcala de Xivert, a town north of Valencia, since 2004. He is a father to a two-year old and two girls aged 5 and 7, reported the news agency. Spain is home to 1 million Moroccans, according to EFE’s recent statistics. In 2018, the country issued a total of 220,929 visas for Moroccans, making them the third most likely non-European nationality to obtain a Spanish visa, after Russia and China. As for citizenship, Spain is tightening its procedures for Moroccans to get citizenship in the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. The Spanish left-wing Movement For Dignity and Citizenship (MDyC) party indicated last month that throughout the past 14 years, only 2,300 people were granted citizenship in the enclaves among a total of 1 million foreign residents there.

Rabat – A recent study from the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) found that social media is contributing to irregular migration from the Maghreb region. The European dream has been a goal for many young people living in the Maghreb region, including Moroccans. The study said that Maghreb migrants in European countries often share posts on social media, depicting Europe as a safe place and with better socio-economic opportunities than their home countries. “Through daily or weekly video blogs and other social media posts, Maghrebi emigres in Europe offer a mostly romanticised representation of the continent,” said ISS. Migrants returning for vacations in their home countries also represent Europe as a dream land. “Through social media this message reaches a bigger pool of youth, including those with little first-hand exposure to the European diaspora,” reads the study. ISS shows that access to the internet has become easy in Maghreb countries, especially in Tunisia,  Morocco, and Algeria. “Sixty-three percent of Moroccans and Tunisians, and 53% of Algerians are online, with many using inexpensive smartphones to connect.” Focusing on internet access in Morocco, the study found that the average Moroccan spends nearly three hours on the internet daily. Read Also: Report: Migration, Mobility Key Elements of Morocco-EU Partnership Social media, according to ISS, also offers migrants ways to reach Europe through lists of migration routes, crossing points to avoid, prices for “different forms of crossing, useful cover stories, and information on the degree and form of counter-migration enforcement used by security forces in both the Maghreb and Europe.” “Posts also cover strategies on how to regularise one’s legal status – or, at the very least, avoid deportation – once in Europe.” The study quoted a Moroccan video, which advised possible irregular migrants to “claim to be underage, claim to be Libyan, claim to be looking for your father” once in Europe. “In the videos’ comments sections, the information becomes more specific: phone numbers of smugglers and the specific dates, times and locations of groups planning to cross. This information is generally unfiltered and uncensored, and is continuously updated and corrected,” warned the study. ISS called on Maghreb countries to engage and cooperate to solve migration issues in the region. “Rather than seeking to stymie social media discussions on migration, governments should see this as a valuable opportunity to understand the factors and frustrations that drive their citizens to depart for Europe.” The study confirmed that  migration content is “likely to continue to grow rapidly” on social media since the number of Maghreb youth migrating to Europe “continues to increase.” “This will create an expanded group of network influencers ready to share their stories and offer advice.”

Washington, DC – While the Western media and academia keep referring to the PJD as an “Islamist party”, Moroccan voters and the public at large have dropped this label in describing the political faction. In fact, the PJD, that had its share of scandals, has shown little “Islamic tendencies”. Thus, the narrative that the PJD is a religious organization ruling as a remedy to the unchecked powers of the “Makhzen’ in Morocco is null and void. For a long while the PJD and its former secretary general and prime minster Abdelilah Benkirane, enjoyed the backing of a sizable share of the Moroccan electorate. While it is true that a large number of voters supported the party for its religious discourse, others trusted that its leaders would be less corrupt and more attuned to the need of the population. Voters recognize the difficulties PJD leaders encountered in forming their first and second governments.  It is not easy to direct ministers, secretaries of state, agencies, many of whom have their own loyalties and agendas. The PJD came to power with no experience of governing but had plenty of time to learn and gain skills in governance.  Seven years into their ascendancy to the premiership, Mr. Othmani and his party can’t get things done suggesting that their failure isn’t merely lack of experience but rather an absence of a program and a deficiency in experts and managerial personnel. It was a challenging environment at first, no doubt. Nonetheless, after two mandates in office, Moroccans expected to see better quality healthcare, improved public school and lower unemployment. Moroccan voters put the PJD in the government hoping to see improvements in key sectors such as public education, health care and employment. Unfortunately, the party has been unable to follow up on policy details or even draft legislation to try to pass in the Parliament. PJD’s leaders including Benkiran, Othmani, and the current Minister of Justice and Liberties Mustafa Ramid had plenty of time to recover from their early blunders when they formed their first government. However, after years in office and no major achievements, the PJD led government seems to have little legitimacy and looks weak and ineffective. The result is that even after seven years of rule, the PJD failed to deliver on the promise of a better life for Moroccans, especially the less fortunate ones. International observers love to judge the PJD in the broader context of the experiment of Islamists parties’ ability to rule. However, the voters in Morocco view the PJD like any other political organization in the nation.  Since there are no reliable opinion polls in Morocco, social media turn into the medium to gage the extent of the PJD’s government approval rating. Popular websites become the source to go to in order to read the public’s mood and feel the citizens’ pulse. Indeed, recent posting on news sites capture a somber mood and Pessimism about the future among Moroccans including the middle class. There is a feeling among the public that the PJD has not contested the powers behind the pockets of corruption and mismanagement that persist in some corners of the Moroccan society. Furthermore, the dreadful state of public education and healthcare sectors are examples of PJD’s policy impotence and incompetence in running a government. The Othmani team would remain feeble, hesitant, and irresolute, and Moroccans are convinced now that the PJD will not fight for them. Articles in the local press show evidence of an overall erosion of public confidence in the PJD government while other political parties find themselves, also, less popular now than during the last parliamentary elections. As the government struggles to show off significant achievements or display major successes, Moroccan voters’ reservoir of goodwill and excitements for the ruling PJD seem to dry out. PM Othmani’s chances of an electoral win in next parliamentary election in 2020 seem slim.

Rabat – Anas Doukkali, Morocco’s health minister, said that there are many clinics and private hospitals that sell medicine at higher prices than the set prices.  Doukkali issued a warning note last week, announcing that the health ministry had conducted an investigation and found that many private hospitals break the law by charging higher than the regulated prices of medical products. The minister promised to sue and penalize the private health institutions and clinics. Doukkali also promised to reinforce the monitoring of drug prices.  According to Doukkali, the clinics take advantage of the absence of supervisors at medical storage cabinets, stressing that every clinic should appoint a pharmacist who is certified by the ministry to supervise the medical supply and the prices of medical products. Hospitals then must provide receipts to patients, and the receipts should reflect the same price as the product’s original price. Raising prices of medical products is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of MAD 800, according to the Moroccan medical law concerning the responsibilities of medical professionals. In February, the ministry announced major cuts to the regulated prices of 319 medicines, including blood derivatives, antibiotics, and treatments for anemia, hemorrhaging, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. The decision was to facilitate citizens’ access to medicines under the provisions of the 2019 Finance Bill on the exemption of Value Added Tax or TVA for medicines that cost more than MAD 588 ($61). The Moroccan government promised Moroccans to improve access to health services and health coverage.

Rabat – Representatives of imprisoned Moroccan Salafis have raised concerns about the “failure” of the country’s de-radicalization programs, complaining that “the government has not kept its promises.” One argument has become familiar for Morocco experts and observers: Since the Casablanca terror attack in 2003, Morocco has heavily invested in counter-terrorism and de-radicalization programs. In addition to its world-renowned anti-terrorism elite police units, Morocco has devised plans to combat extremist discourses via education and rehabilitation. Rabat has since been described in a slew of reports as North Africa’s bastion of counter-extremism and de-radicalization. Yesterday, however, members of organizations representing extremism-linked inmates raised their voice about their growing “lack of trust” in the country’s new de-radicalization programs. They particularly protested the government’s unwillingness to deliver on a March 2011 agreement with representatives of formerly and currently imprisoned Salafis. The agreement, signed on March 25, 2011, entailed promises such as reduced prison terms and improved detention conditions. The deal involved over 1,200 inmates to whom the government promised mitigation of prison sentences and smoother rehabilitation. In return, the inmates promised to “fully subscribe” to the government’s de-radicalization vision and ease the task of rehabilitation workers. Abderrahim Ghazali, the spokesperson of the Coordination of Salafi Inmates, said the government has failed them. “Eight years later the results are mixed. The government has not kept its promises.” Of the 1,200 mainly concerned with the March 2011 agreement, 85 are serving “harsh sentences” for links to the 2003 Casablanca bombings, according to Ghazali. Also concerned with the agreement, he explained, are nearly 500 returnees from former ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria as well as members of extremist cells dismantled during DGSN or BCIJ raids across Morocco. Having obtained what it wanted, Ghazali elaborated, the government is no longer showing any willingness to have dialogue. He said, “Right now there is no dialogue between the government and Salafi inmates. All they offer us these days is the Moussalaha Program.” The Moussalaha reconciliation program is a 2017 initiative launched through collaborative work between security services; extremism experts; the National Council for Human Rights (CNDH); and the Mohammedia League of Scholars or Ulemma, Morocco’s highest body of Islamic clerics. According to Moroccan authorities, the program is a “comprehensive de-radicalization plan” with four axes of intervention: Religious re-education, courses on human rights and civic duties, psychological assistance, and socio-economic assistance. While authorities describe the program as “incredibly successful,” Ghazali said that Salafi inmates he spoke with “have no faith in Moussalaha and refuse to subscribe to it.” The news comes amid concerns over the degree of success of Morocco’s de-radicalization strategy. In February, a study from the US Carnegie Institute Endowment for International Peace established that there is an alarming rate of recidivism among released Moroccan jihadis. While Rabat has been successful in dismantling terrorist cells and preventing terror attacks, the same cannot be said of the country’s de-radicalization strategy, the study found. It established that “despite Rabat’s sporadic efforts to deradicalize jihadis while they are in prison, the policy remains unable to reintegrate them after they have been released.”

Rabat – Observers are questioning who will replace the ailing Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as the original date for the 2019 presidential election, April 18, is around the corner, although Bouteflika has promised to postpone it. All Africa reported that the Algerian government “might force Bouteflika to resign and instal the head of the Senate, Abdelkader Bensalah, to serve as interim president for 45 days.” However, Bensalah’s Moroccan origin is problematic for some Algerian politicians. The head of Algeria’s Justice and Development Front Party, Lakhdar Benkhellaf, argued that Bensalah, speaker of Algeria’s National Council, cannot replace Bouteflika until elections as an interim president because he was once Moroccan. In a television broadcast, Benkhellaf said, “The popular movement [in Algeria] demands the immediate departure of the president. He can do this either by resigning or by applying Article 102 of the Constitution.” Article 102 stipulates, “Whenever the President of the Republic, because of serious and enduring illness, finds himself in a total incapacity to exercise his functions, the Constitutional Council shall meet as of right and, after having verified by all appropriate means that the incapacity indeed exists, shall propose to the Parliament by unanimity to declare a state of incapacity.” Benkhellaf said that Bensalah has a “problem with his nationality of origin. The condition for a [leader] occupying the post of President of the Republic, is that he must have the Algerian nationality of origin. And he [Bensalah] had another nationality until 1964 during which he had obtained Algerian nationality,” said the Algerian MP. Benkhellaf added that Bensalah’s former nationality “poses a problem.” According to Article 87 of the Algerian Constitution, candidates are ineligible for the presidency if they have a foreign nationality. To be eligible, candidates should have solely Algerian citizenship from birth and prove that his/her parents were also born with Algerian citizenship.  Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has been running the country as since 1999, was born in Oujda, a city in northeast Morocco on the border with Algeria. Benkhellaf ’s comments on Bensalah’s nationality implies also the long-standing tension between the two countries on a number of regional conflicts, including Western Sahara and the closed border. Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994. Algeria made the decision after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Algeria is witnessing waves of protests, called “Hirak” or popular movement. The protests began against Bouteflika’s decision to campaign for a fifth presidential term and are continuing against his decision to postpone the 2019 election, suggesting that he aims to indefinitely extend his fourth mandate.

Rabat – The African Ministerial Conference on the African Union’s Role in Supporting the UN-Led Political Process in Western Sahara has issued its final declaration unanimously supporting the AU’s Decision 693, which reaffirmed the UN as the only authority to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. The conference met in Marrakech this week. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared a statement listing the fundamentals of the final declaration approved by the 37 African states attending the conference, including Morocco. The 37 African countries, according to the ministry, agreed to welcome the “unanimous adoption” of the AU’s Decision 693 adopted in July 2018 at the 31st AU session in Nouakchott.  The decision pushed back against the efforts of some African countries to mediate the Western Sahara conflict under the auspices of the AU by affirming the UN-led political process as the only legitimate institution to find a mutually agreed upon solution to the Western Sahara conflict. At the Marrakech conference, the African states also agreed to “preserve the spirit and the letter of the 693 Decision.” The countries also believe that “any initiative to undermine the substance of Decision 693 could undermine the credibility of the partnership process and their contribution to the achievement goals of our continent.” Nigeria, which recognized the Polisario Front in 1984, also attended the conference and signed the declaration, a testament to Moroccan diplomatic gains. Notably absent from the meeting were Mauritania and Algeria, both involved in the UN-led political process in Western Sahara.  The Marrakech event also aimed to counter an event hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity meeting this week in South Africa. Algeria and several southern African countries are attending the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi People in Pretoria, meeting March 25-26. South Africa and Namibia are hosting the event. Algeria, South Africa, and Namibia, hostile to Morocco’s sovereignty over the region, have long held links with the separatist group of the Polisario Front, supporting their independence claims. The symposium seeks to emphasize that the “solution of Western Sahara should be based on the principle of self-determination and decolonisation.” The Southern African Development Community (SADC) symposium marked the attendance of Algeria’s foreign minister Ramtane Lamamra; and Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa; Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni; and the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali. On Monday, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita criticized hostile actions inside the African Union from Polisario’s supporters. The official said that the Decision 693 of the AU should be “neither reinterpreted, nor circumvented nor instrumentalized” because it enshrined the exclusive competence of the UN.

Rabat – Morocco is sending four senior athletes to the 43rd World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, on March 30. One of the athletes is Abdalaati Iguider, 32, a seasoned middle distance runner who has represented Morocco in various championships since 2004. Iguidor won bronze at the London Olympic Games and the IAAF World Indoor Championship title in 2012 for the 1,500 meters. In 2015, Iguider became the eighth fastest ever to run the 1,500 meter at the Herculis Diamond League in Monaco. Rababe Arafi, 28, will also be competing in Denmark. An outstanding athlete, in 2018, Arafi was the only athlete to secure a double victory at the Mediterranean Games in the women’s 800 meter and 1,500 meter. Arafi also earned three medals at the African Championships in Athletics in 2012.  A steeplechase runner, Soufiane El Bakkali, 23, is the third senior athlete on his way to Denmark. He secured first in the 3,000 meter steeplechase race in 2018 in Spain and won second place at the African Championships in Asaba, Nigeria, the same year. Kaoutar Farkoussi, a 23-year-old long-distance runner, rounds out the senior Moroccan team. The Royal Moroccan Federation of Athletics (FRMA) announced the runners on its website. In preparation, the athletes are undergoing an intensive training period in Ifrane, a city in the Middle Atlas Mountains known for its ideal atmosphere for athletes, according to Anfas Press. Although FRMA is only sending four senior athletes to Denmark, it has a more robust junior squad. Eleven junior athletes, five boys and six girls, will be at the start line of the world championship.  Morocco hosted the World Cross Country Championships twice, in 1975 and 1998.  Future prospects for Moroccan athletes In retired professional runner Hicham El Guerrouj’s view, the situation of athletics in Morocco has become dismal. Morocco enjoyed a formidable reputation in running in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to professional athletes like Hicham El Guerrouj, whose trailblazing trajectory, along with the prowess of Nawal El Moutawakel, Said Aouita, and others, is still a source of pride for Moroccans. A retired Moroccan track and field Olympian, Said Aouita, now 59, won gold in the 5,000-meter at the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1987 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and won gold in the 3,000 meter at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships.  Called the Moroccan sportsman of the century, Aouita set five outdoor records for the 1,500-meter, 2,000-meter, 3,000-meter, 5,000-meter, and two miles. He also set a record for the indoor 3,000 meter.  After Aouita began losing ground to Algerian athlete Noureddine Morceli in the 1990s, El Guerrouj, a middle-distance runner, won Morocco’s pride back. El Guerrouj still holds the world record for the outdoor 1,500-meter, 1 mile, and 2,000-meter events. He also held the indoor world record for the 1 mile and 1,500-meter events from 1997 up until February and March this year.  The first Moroccan to win a world championship medal after Said Aouita, the now-retired 44-year-old El Guerrouj is regarded one of the best middle-distance runners globally. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was the first to win  both the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter at the Olympics since 1924. In a nine-year span, El Guerrouj competed in 68 1,500-meter races, winning 63 of them. Nawal el Moutawakel, 56, made history for Moroccans after winning her first medal in the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 in the 400 meter hurdles, making her the first Arab, African, and Muslim woman—and the first Moroccan athlete male or female—to win a gold medal at the world stage in that event. According to Jeune Afrique magazine, she was also ranked among the 50th most influential African personalities in the world in 2014. In an interview with Radio Mars, Hicham El Guerrouj expressed despair at the condition of athletics in Morocco earlier this year. Especially for those coming from lower social classes, El Guerrouj said they are not given the opportunity to showcase their talents. “Today, the reality is that [Moroccan] athletics is going from bad to worse, from failures to even more failures, and as a result generations of athletes are unfortunately lost,” el Guerrouj stated. “Today athletes don’t even have places to change or take a bath, this should be punished. I call on King Mohammed VI to save [Moroccan] athletes.”

Rabat – An engineering teacher at the Hoofdvaart College vocational school in Amsterdam has received a temporary suspension for calling the Prophet Muhammad a “pedophile.”  According to Dutch education minister Arie Slob, the 49-year-old teacher had discussed Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), telling his students that the prophet is seen as a “pedophile” in the Netherlands. The teacher’s comments, made in January, had offended students, and they reported him to the school board for “insulting religion.” The school suspended the teacher and the story reached the lower house of the Dutch Parliament. Slob said in a written parliamentary statement—after his ministry sent a commission to inspect the college and speak to the board, students, and teachers—that the teacher’s suspension was justified. He also informed the lower house that it is temporary. The teacher’s lawyer, Wilco Brusse, criticized Slob’s statement as “extremely careless,” reported Dutch news outlet De Volkskrant. The lawyer explained that the ministry’s commission was biased because it did not question the teacher during its investigation and never considered his version of the story. “As a result, my client’s reputation is now tarnished,” Brusse said. In an interview with the Volkskrant, the teacher denied having made the statement and insisted that he respects other believers. Muslims in the Netherlands are witnesses to several forms of Islamophobia, experiencing both verbal harassment and physical violence. One of the recent instances of Islamophobia was against a mosque earlier in March.  The German Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) group attacked a mosque in the Netherlands by hanging a banner with an obscene message insulting the prophet next to a mannequin dressed in traditional Arab male dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint. Provocations at mosques are not uncommon in the country. Last summer in Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, Pegida led a series of offensive acts on mosques by roasting pork, considered impure in Islam, in front of mosques to provoke Muslims. The world is still mourning the March 15 terror attacks on two mosques in New Zealand, which killed 50 Muslims.

Rabat – The US State Department has approved the sale of 25 F-16 fighter jets to Morocco for $3.8 billion. The US also agreed to approve of Morocco’s purchase of upgrades for the 23 F-16 aircraft it already has, for $985.2 million. The military deal, according to Defense News, is Morocco’s second largest purchase from the US after a November 2018 agreement for new Abrams tanks. On November 29, the US State Department announced that it had approved a deal to enhance 162 Abrams tanks with machine guns and rounds for an estimated cost of $1.259 billion for Morocco. Morocco aims to upgrade its military capability as well as enhancing interoperability with the US and other partners. Morocco buys most of its arms from the US. Between 2014 and 2018, Morocco received 62 percent of its arms from the US, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In addition to the US, France is also a major supplier of arms to Morocco. Despite Morocco’s efforts to upgrade its military, Algeria has a more powerful military. In its latest reports, SIPRI ranked Algeria among the top five importers of major arms in the world between 2014-2018. The Global Firepower Index (GFP) ranked Morocco’s military power 61st out of 137 countries globally for 2019. GFP said that Morocco has 1,109 combat tanks, 800 artilleries of three different types, and 2,270 armored fighting vehicles. The report also mentions that the country holds a “Power Index” rating of 0.8244 in which 0.0 is “perfect.” Morocco also has 346,000 military personnel in total: 196,000 active personnel and 150,000 reserve personnel. According to Global Firepower, Morocco has 291 total aircraft, including 61 fighters, 16 attack planes, 31 for transports, and 79 trainers. The country also has 72 rocket projectors. The report lists zero submarines, 3 frigates, and 81 patrol vessels. The report estimated Morocco’s defense budget at $3,400,000,000, but lowered Morocco’s score because of its large debt to international countries.Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt, according to the report.

Rabat – The United Nations has commented on US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Israel’s authority over Golan Heights. In a press conference, the UN Secretary-General’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said on Monday that the UN’s position “has remained unchanged from last week to today.” Dujarric added that it is “clear that the status of Golan has not changed. The UN’s policy on the Golan is reflected in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and that policy, again, has not changed.” On Monday, Trump signed a proclamation officially recognizing Israeli authority over Golan Heights, a territory on the Israeli-Syrian border. Trump said, “Today I am taking historic action to promote Israel’s ability to defend itself.” In a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump remarked, “This was a long time in the making.” He added that the decision should have been made “many decades ago.” Israel took control of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981, a move the UN did not recognize as legal. In reference to a missile attack from Gaza into Israel that injured seven on Monday, Trump said: “We do not want to see another attack like the one suffered this morning north of Tel Aviv.”  Netanyahu described Trump’s decision as “historic justice” and a “diplomatic victory.”  “Israel won the Golan Heights in a just war of defense,” he added. Prior to Trump’s proclamation, several countries condemned Trump’s decision to recognize Israel’s authority over the region. “The recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, occupied territory, would be contrary to international law, in particular the obligation for states not to recognise an illegal situation,” the French foreign ministry said last week. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised to take the issue of Golan to the UN. In December 2017, President Trump announced a controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The president also moved the US embassy from Tel  Aviv to Jerusalem. The decision received international backlash. King Mohammed VI was among the world leaders who condemned the action.

Rabat – Award-winning French director Michel Ocelot is working on an animated film featuring Morocco and Turkey, reported UK-based news outlet Middle East Online (MEO) on Sunday. “The starting point is Morocco … in the 18th century,” Ocelot told Middle East Online at the Meknes International Festival of Animated Cinema (FICAM) taking place from March 22 to 27. The film “depicts… a female doctor who has been listening to tales orated by female storytellers in the palaces where she has been working,” he explained. Ocelot said that cinema can be a powerful inspiration for good or bad. “The guy who committed the massacre in New Zealand did a cinema. The cult of weapons is also a cinema art. I’m sure that when we make a violent movie, it inspires people to kill,” said Ocelot. “People, however, become noble” when they watch “noble” movies, he added. Ocelot said that animated cinema in Morocco needs some work to make it appeal to a global audience while preserving local taste. “The danger is to try to sell Moroccan animated cinema abroad and lose the identity.  You have to be both Moroccan and international,” he said. Ocelot is a self-taught director who kick-started his career in animation movies with the 1998 animation film “Kirikou and the Sorceress.” Last month, Michel Ocelot won the Cesar for Best Animated Film for his film “Dilili in Paris” at the 44th Cesar Award ceremony. Ocelot will present the film at FICAM 2019. “Dilili in Paris” shows the exploitation and enslavement of women at the turn of the 20th century Belle Epoque. “The harm men do to women is worse than wars. We should talk about this taboo,” Ocelot said. FICAM was founded in 2001 and has been under the patronage of King Mohammed VI since 2018. The Aicha Foundation is responsible for its production and the French Institute of Meknes provides artistic direction.

Rabat – An individual used an accelerant to set fire to a mosque at 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning, March 24, in Escondido, southern California.  The arsonist also left behind offensive graffiti on the wall referencing the terror attack on two New Zealand mosques on Friday, March 15. Police did not reveal the content of the graffiti, but commented that the “graffiti left behind by the suspect made reference to the shooting incident in New Zealand.” According to the Escondido Police Department, seven people were inside the mosque at the time of the blaze, but none of them were injured. The incident happened more than two hours before the early morning fajr prayer. The seven in the mosque used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire before police and firemen arrived. The fire only slightly damaged the exterior facade of the mosque. Escondido police Lieutenant Chris Lick said that the suspect used an accelerant to set the fire. Police have not identified any suspects and are investigating the incident as arson and hate crime. The police are getting assistance from fire investigators, a regional bomb/arson task force, and agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Since the New Zealand attack, police have increased surveillance in Escondido by deploying patrol vehicles at every corner in order to help the Muslim community feel safe. Police in Escondido encouraged locals to report any suspicious activity near mosques and urged the Muslim community to stay vigilant and watchful at their prayer centers.

Rabat – More than 10,000 of young Moroccans made their voices heard internationally as they flocked to Rabat to protest the government’s alternative decision regarding their status as contractual teachers throughout Saturday night and Sunday morning. The teachers, who describe themselves as “forcibly contracted educators,” decided to camp out in front of Parliament on Saturday night to show their determination. Anti-riot police used water cannons and police motorcycles to disperse the protests.Some teachers also said there was “violence” during the protests. Some video clips and pictures showed faces covered in blood. The government has hired teachers under annually renewable contracts every year since 2016.To fill the need for more teachers while managing heavy public debts, the government hired the teachers through regional academies. The contractual teachers, who are not officially part of the public sector, receive the same salary, starting at MAD 5,000 ($520) monthly, as teachers who are permanently on the government payroll but have reduced pensions. Teachers have not held up their end of the contracts they signed, the government said. Minister of Education Said Amzazi issued a statement earlier this month, explaining that teachers were informed of the contracts’ conditions before signing them.But contractual teachers are demanding equal treatment to their public sector counterparts. Oussama Hamdouch, a 27-year-old member of the National Coordination of “the Forcibly Contracted Teachers,” spoke to Morocco World News about their demands and loopholes in the contracts. Hamdouch said that the situation of the teachers has reached a critical and decisive moment. “We are in a battle” Hamdouch, who became a teacher when he signed a contract in 2018, said that the government has offered to change 14 articles of the contracts as a compromise. He said that the Ministry of Education offered to change the teachers from “contractual teachers” hired under fixed terms to full employees of the regional academies of education. The offer was unacceptable, teachers said.Regional academies do not have the ability to adopt all teachers, Hamdouch said. “They lack the human and financial resources teachers need.”Morocco’s regional academies are not autonomous institutions and receive funding from the Education Ministry. “The academies will be able to fire teachers if they don’t have financial resources whenever they want to. School principals will also have a certain authority over us. We want to work with dignity like the other teachers in the public sector,” Hamdouch told MWN. Among the working conditions the contractual teachers are complaining about is the pension system. Teachers working under contracts will only receive 40 percent of their monthly salary after retirement. If they receive MAD 10,000 while working, the teachers will receive MAD 4,000 monthly after retiring. Debts, politics drive the issue Hamdouch said that contractual teachers signed the contracts because they were not offered better job opportunities. “We had no choice. The job market is disappointing.” Explaining why the group representing teachers calls themselves “forcibly contracted teachers,” Hammouch said, “If the government wants to increase the prices on gas cylinders, there will be protests, but people will buy anyways because of their need and lack of options.” In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance announced a joint decision to recruit teachers through contracts  to offer job opportunities, to meet a need for teachers, and to improve human resources in education. The Ministry did not respond to our calls for comment. The unemployment rate in Morocco remains high, despite the slight year-on-year decrease from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP). Morocco continues to borrow from international firms to complete socio-economic and infrastructure projects and cover its budget deficit. HCP estimated that the overall public debt of the economy will increase to 82.5 percent of GDP in 2019.
Several senior officials have warned that rising external debt could negatively impact Morocco’s economy. In 2018, the governor of the central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, Abdellatif  Jouahri, said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2019, up from 13.8 percent of GDP in 2018. He added that he refused to apply in 2016 when the government was looking for 10,000 candidates. “I did not have a choice in 2018; I applied because there are no other options.” One condition of the contract specifies that the teachers cannot seek to become public sector employees in the education sector for the duration of the contract, a key demand of the protesting teachers. Good health coverage, bad pay According to the contracts, teachers’ salaries can increase depending on the employee’s pay grade. But the ministry did not respect some of the conditions in the contracts, teachers say. The government should increase the salary for the contractual teachers by MAD 100 annually. Every two years, the ministry should offer qualifying exams to evaluate the performance of teachers which could allow them to move to a higher pay grade. Another teacher speaking on condition of anonymity, however, acknowledged that the teachers are offered good health coverage. “The government introduced employment under fixed term contracts because of pressure from the World Bank,” Hamdouch said. To handle mounting debts, the government has reduced its payroll obligations. “The contracts make teachers feel unstable, disappointed, and deceived, he said.

Rabat – In remarks at an AU conference in Marrakech, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has spoken about the importance of the AU’s adoption of Decision 693 and its support for the UN-led political process on the Western Sahara conflict. The decision was adopted at the 31st AU in July 2018 in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Bourita made his remarks at the opening of the African Ministerial Conference on the African Union on Monday. According to Bourita, the decision “contributes to strengthening serenity within the AU regarding the Moroccan Sahara issue.” He argued the decision should be “neither reinterpreted, nor circumvented nor instrumentalized” because it enshrined the exclusive competence of the UN to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The decision also prevented a parallel process to that of the United Nations and stressed the AU’s support for the UN-led efforts. The conference in Marrakech is convening representatives of 37 African countries from the five subregions of Africa. The chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, released a report in July 2018, stressing the AU’s support of the UN-led political process to end the conflict in Western Sahara.

Rabat – Essaouira and Shengzhou, a city in eastern China, signed a memorandum of cooperation on Friday, March 22, to promote friendship, cooperation, and exchanges of experience in areas such as tourism, culture, transport, the environment, and digital technology. Hicham Jabari, the mayor of Essaouira, and Yan Gang, the mayor of Shengzhou, signed the agreement at the first International Shaoxing (Shengzhou) Green Tea Conference.  Trade between China and Essaouira dates back to the 18th century, when Chinese tea arrived in Essaouira and then was distributed to other ports in Morocco and West Africa, Jabbari said. Jabbari also mentioned other cooperation prospects for Essaouira, one of Morocco’s most popular beach cities. “We are thinking of the city of Essaouira as an ecological city, and we are thinking of a framework for cooperation to lead to the adoption of electric buses” in Essaouira. In a speech at the opening of the conference, Mourad El Ayachi, Morocco’s deputy ambassador to China, welcomed the signing of the memorandum. El Ayachi stressed the importance of developing economic and cultural interactions between the two cities, improving mutual exchanges and creating conditions for “win-win” cooperation. He also referred to the long-standing friendship between the peoples of the two countries, which dates back to the 14th century, during the visit of the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta to China. Morocco, the world’s largest importer of green tea in 2017, accounted for 25 percent of the total export volume of the tea industry in China, according to Moroccan news outlet Medi 1.

Rabat – After submitting a request to UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee to add Gnawa music to its Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list, Morocco has made a similar request for tbourida, a traditional horse festival, also known as the Moroccan fantasia. The Moroccan Ministry of Culture and Communication announced on Monday that it had prepared and submitted the file for tbourida in partnership with the Moroccan Royal Society of Horse Encouragement (SOREC). The move is part of the ministry’s project to promote Moroccan culture abroad. The ICH list seeks to enhance visibility for the traditions of communities but does not set standards of excellence or exclusivity. “Tbourida is a major component of horse-related sports … It is an art deeply-rooted in the Moroccan culture and associated with both national and regional festivities,” stated the ministry. Tbourida, which is known internationally as “fantasia,” is a type of horseback riding in which equestrians fire guns and ride in synchrony. It is a colorful exhibition usually held during seasonal festivals known as “moussem”or other cultural and religious festivals. Tbourida is a historical practice in the Maghreb region, depicting the strong relationship between the man and the horse. To preserve and promote the Moroccan Gnawa art, which is a combination of spiritual or ritual poetry and dance, the ministry registered it for the ICH list on February 21. UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) will consider adding Gnawa music and tbourida to its ICH list at its 14th session on December 9-14, in Bogota.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) has reported that its 2018 revenues jumped by 15 percent to MAD 55.9 billion over 2017.  OCP group gave the figures in its annual outcomes report for 2018 on Monday. The group said that the positive result was supported by demand for higher volumes and higher prices for both phosphoric acid and fertilizer. Volumes and prices remained stable for phosphate rock. “These positive results further strengthened the Group’s position as the largest global exporter of phosphate fertilizers, while it has maintained its market-leading positions in phosphoric acid and rock,” wrote the group in a press release. OCP reported that in 2018 fertilizer revenues grew by 20 percent compared to 2017 and represented 55 percent of its total revenues, an increase from 45 percent in 2014.  The growth in fertilizer revenue is explained by higher demands globally. North America imported 24 percent of OCP’s exports, Latin America 23 percent, Africa 22 percent, Asia 16 percent, and Europe 15 percent. Rock and phosphoric acid each represented 18 percent of OCP’s total revenue. OCP exported the majority of its phosphoric acid, sales of which grew 39 percent, to Asia, Latin America, and Europe. OCP said that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), were MAD 17.1 billion in 2018, up by 34 percent from 2017. The company reported that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2018 were MAD 11.3 billion, up by 71 percent from 2017. By the end of 2018, OCP’s net financial debt was MAD 35.2 billion, down from MAD 43.9 billion in 2017. The leverage ratio was 2.02. OCP predicted that 2019 will be prosperous with increased demand and consumption led by a stronger spring application season in North America, improved weather conditions in Europe, a pick-up in Brazil, and higher demand from Africa.

Rabat – New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has tasked a royal commision with making a top-level inquiry into whether security services could have prevented the March 15 terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch. Jainda told reporters on Monday, “It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to how this act of terrorism occurred and how we could have stopped it.”  She also ordered the royal commision to produce a “comprehensive” report. The commission will look into ways to prevent terror attacks from happening, the accessibility of semi-automatic weapons, and social media’s role in the attacks. On March 15, a 28-year-old Australian attacker filmed himself shooting Muslims inside two mosques in Christchurch. The attacker killed 50 people and injured 50 more. The incident generated condemnation and shock across the world. Recently, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) spoke with several members of the Moroccan community in New Zealand who expressed fear over the terror attack. Moroccan businessman Taoufik El Idrissi said that “all New Zealanders, including members of the Moroccan community, are in a state of shock, and no one is close  to forgetting this terrible day.” “We were leaving our doors open in a country … where we thought to be far from all the evils of the world,” he said. He added that the lives of all people have “changed” since March 15. “We need a lot of courage to overcome this ordeal,” he added. El Idrissi said that he wanted to show solidarity with the victims by traveling more than 300 kilometers from the city of Palmerston to Christchurch to be alongside other members of the Muslim community. Another Moroccan member of the community, Ahmed Belghashi, said he was only a few kilometers from Al Noor Mosque during the attack. “I was working at the bank when we knew the terrible news of the terrorist attack.” He said the atmosphere at the bank was sad. “The members of the Muslim community feel anguish they have never experienced in New Zealand. The peace that prevailed in this peaceful country no longer exists,” he added. Adil Bennani, another Moroccan, said, “The faces changed and the smiles on New Zealanders’ faces disappeared.”  With tears and a cracking voice, Bennani said, “We have lost dear friends in these attacks.” Reports said that the victims of the attacks were aged 3 to 77.

Rabat – Algerian politicians are warning of an economic crisis, as revenues from Algeria’s oil and gas exports are dropping. “The debate is now focused on politics, but the real iceberg is the risk of an economic crisis in the next couple of years and no one has a strategy to tackle this,” said Riccardo Fabiani, an Algeria-focused analyst at the London-based research institute Energy Aspects.  According to Fabiani’s analysis, Algeria’s foreign reserves are falling quicker than anticipated and they “probably have less than two years of import cover left.” As Europe’s third-biggest natural gas supplier, Algeria’s fuel exports bring in more than 95 percent of its foreign currency.  Meanwhile, employees at energy firms are responding to online calls to strike and join the mass protests. Officials fear a strike could threaten energy exports. The CEO of the country’s state energy firm, Sonatrach, said last weekend that while employees have the right to join the protests, they should first fulfil their duties and keep working. Last week, employees in several oil and gas corporations went on strike nationwide, joining the demonstrations against their ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Protests are still ongoing in the North African country, and Bouteflika’s party itself rejected his plan for a leadership transition. Although he withdrew his bid for a fifth presidential term on March 11, Bouteflika insisted on delaying the April 18 elections, effectively extending his fourth term indefinitely. He has called for a national conference to approve a new constitution and reform the political system before his successor steps into power. Bouteflika’s party rejected his plans for a national conference. The National Liberation Front (FLN) told Algerian television channel Dzair News that the conference idea is “no longer valid” because unelected figures would participate in it, and Algerians do not want it. When Bouteflika announced the conference, Algerians bitterly accused him of trying to “trick” them into ending the protests without achieving their aims.  Demonstrators then took to the streets to start further protests, denouncing the president’s failure to let go of power and demanding that he leave at the end of his current term on April 28. Demonstrations across the country started on February 22 and are the biggest Algeria has experienced since the Arab Spring in 2011.

Rabat – A driver harassed and attempted to run into two veiled Muslim women while they were picking up their children from school on Friday, March 22, in Uccle, Belgium. The two Muslim women, Nabila and her sister Kautar, were at a pedestrian crossing when the driver began to swear at them and make Islamophobic comments, before attempting to hit the women with his car.  He then sped off. The women were able to write down his license plate and make a formal complaint to the police, who arrested the attacker not long after. Nabila told the Brussels Times, “In the ten years that we have been here, we have never experienced any problems. I’m still in shock.” However, this is not the first incident of its kind in Belgium. In December 2018, a veiled woman of Moroccan origin walking down the street with her 10-year-old daughter was punched in the face. A CCTV camera captured the incident, and the woman could be seen falling to the ground screaming after the attacker ran off.  In 2018, the Collective against Islamophobia in Belgium (CCIB) provided further insight into Islamophobic attacks in Belgium. In a report, CCIB revealed that they had opened 90 investigations into Islamophobic attacks in 2018. Seventy-six percent of the victims were women.  The collective estimated that an Islamophobic attack occurs once every two days in Belgium on average. They also found Islamophobia is most often expressed in the media and on the internet (29 percent), in general society (17 percent), in education (16 percent), and at work (14 percent).

Rabat – After deliberations between the government and fuel distribution companies, the minister delegate of public affairs and governance, Lahcen Daoudi, stated on Sunday, March 24, that the government has reached a final decision to regulate the price of fuel. After a final meeting between the government and the Moroccan Petroleum Group (GPM) which represents fuel companies on February 19, when fuel company representatives said regulation was reasonable, the companies have reportedly agreed to conform to the government’s final decision. According to Daoudi, there is no disagreement between fuel companies and the government so far on the principle of oil price regulation. “I have accomplished my mission and will hand my report to the head of government in order to put the agreement into practice in the near future,” said Daoudi, whose ministry has been negotiating with fuel companies. Daoudi said that fuel companies had no option to block the regulation of oil prices, but some companies’ opposition made the decision difficult. The government has been firm about regulating fuel prices despite the criticism of the Council of Competition, which described the move as unnecessary. The council said it “would harm industry stakeholders.” In mid-December 2018, Daoudi, whose ministry regulates pricing, gave in to demands to regulate oil prices following complaints about the large profits companies had made in a two-year period. An MP of the Democratic Left Federation party, Omar Balafrej, described the profits of fuel companies, which he estimated at MAD 17 million, as “unethical.” “This [profit] would not have happened if it were not for the Council of Competition being frozen,” Balafrej argued. He further asserted, “This huge amount of money would ensure that all Moroccan students benefit from free transport.” He questioned why politicians have not talked about seizing companies’ legal profits. “It’s strange that none of the MPs or heads of parties have raised the issue of retrieving the 17 billion dirhams,” he said. “It’s not a ‘trivial’ amount.” In 2015, the government liberalized the prices of fuel. According to one MP from the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Abdellah Bounau, fuel companies tripled their profits from MAD 300 million to MAD 900 million. Bounau chaired a committee of inquiry into oil prices last year.

Rabat – After Mozambique launched an international call for emergency aid following the deadly Cyclone Idai on March 14-15, Morocco sent 93 tons aid which landed on Sunday. Abdelali Rahali, the Moroccan ambassador in Maputo, Mozambique, received the aid yesterday from the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). FAR delivered 200 tents, 2,000 blankets, and foodstuffs, according to the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. On the occasion, the Mozambican minister of agriculture and food security, Higino De Marule, thanked King Mohammed VI for his humanitarian gesture in a time of need, expressing that his country was “not surprised by the gesture because the Moroccan and Mozambican people are united.” De Marule emphasized that the Mozambican people—especially those who are still in the affected area, need all the support they can get, including food, medicine, and shelter. The situation in Beira, a major Mozambican city on the Indian Ocean where Idai hit, noted the minister, is improving thanks to international aid and the efforts of Mozambican contributors. For his part, Ambassador Rahali affirmed that King Mohammed VI’s gesture reflects the strong and sincere ties keeping Morocco and Mozambique together.  Mozambique’s Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia told reporters last Saturday, March 23, that the cyclone’s the death toll had risen to 446 from 417. He added that the cyclone affected 531,000 people, and 110,000 were in camps. Correia said on Saturday that some 1,500 people were still sitting in trees and on rooftops and needed immediate help, more than a week after the cyclone hit on March 14. Many died after falling from precarious perches. The floods have also raised water-borne diseases such as cholera, prompting the Mozambican government to open a cholera treatment center. Cyclone Idai, described by the UN as the most disastrous weather event ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, lashed Beira with winds of up to 170 kilometers per hour. The storm had developed in Malawi, moved out to the ocean, and after hitting Mozambique, moved inland to Zimbabwe, killing hundreds in its wake. Other countries that sent aid to Mozambique include Turkey, Portugal, and Tanzania.The European Union and Pope Francis also sent aid.

Rabat – Lebanon has refused entry to Moroccan journalist Nora Fouari after an immigration official noticed her passport bore a sticker showing she had visited Israel before. The journalist, who works for Assabah newspaper, took to her Facebook to express her anger over the situation. Fouari wrote: “Security services at the Rafic Al Hariri airport in Beirut prevented me from entering Lebanese territory because of a previous visit to Israel. I spent the night in a cold room with a Palestinian … who has an Israeli visa printed on her passport.” She added that the security services sent her to Istanbul after long hours of waiting and a “stupid investigation.” Once in Istanbul, the journalist spent a night “held” in a room with “undocumented migrants” and people arrested for forgery before returning to Morocco.  According to the journalist, her passport had a sticker instead of a stamp or official visa from Israel because Israeli immigration is aware that it can prevent passport bearers from traveling in some Arab countrie. “I forgot to remove a sticker that proves my journey in Israel from the back of the passport, and I had already entered another Arab country without any problems.” She continued, “The securityman at Rafic El Hariri Airport did not like me … he thought that I was showing off and in love with myself, and he was searching for something until he found the sticker. I had to keep laughing with him because he is handsome, and because I am Moroccan.” In another post, the journalist criticized Lebanese people who supported their country’s decision to refuse her entry. The journalist addressed “those who consider the ‘peoples of the Arab Maghreb’ to have provided nothing in the war against the Zionist enemy  …. we are proud of our identity, our culture, our civilization and our openness, and we thank God that we are far away from you geographically and intellectually.”  Criticizing the Lebanese government, Fouari said that Israel would not have found itself a home “without your treachery and conspiracies … We, here in Morocco, are happy to receive your citizens who live among us with dignity.” Fouari’s case is not the first time a Moroccan has faced consequences for visiting Israel.  An Arab women’s business council stripped Moroccan poet Bouchrail Echchaoui of an award she received in Lebanon after she visited Israel. The majority of Moroccans criticize any move towards normalizing diplomatic ties with Israel. Amid rumors that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was planning an official visit to Morocco, the Moroccan government received backlash from campaigners.  Journalists questioned Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi about the rumors, but he declined to comment.  Dozens of activists went to Parliament in Rabat to protest against any normalization of Moroccan relations with Israel in  February.

Rabat – As the only delegate from Morocco, 22-year-old Noureddine El Bakali competed against some of the most experienced debaters in the world at the six-day Harvard World Model United Nations (MUN) in Madrid March 17-22.  During the conference, El Bakali was part of a field of 2,000 delegates from over 110 countries. “It was a pleasure to be there and represent Morocco in such [an] important event, I’m doing what I love and I would like to help my country to develop itself in the future,” said El Bakali. El Bakali was born and raised in Al Hoceima, a city in northern Morocco, and began attending the Spanish Institute Melchor de Jovellanos when he was 5 years old. He is now studying political science and law at the University of Granada. This year, El Bakali is partaking in the Erasmus political science program at Sciences Po Bordeaux in France. El Bakali began partaking in MUN conferences in 2017 and has since attended five conferences. In 2018, he took part in a conference in Madrid representing Morocco where his committee debated Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. He has also acted as a delegate representing other countries, such as Spain, France, and South Africa. El Bakali told Morocco World News the reason he partakes in MUN conferences is to further his diplomatic skills. “Diplomacy is what I would like to do in the future, and I hope that it will be for my country Morocco,” said El Bakali. What is Model United Nations? MUN is an extra-curricular activity where students roleplay as delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. The purpose of the conferences is to provide students with opportunities and experience to debate and find resolutions to world conflicts. MUN conferences are held around the world at the middle school, high school, and university level. Harvard World Model United Nations is the world’s most internationally-diverse university-level MUN and the largest outside North America. Over 2,000 university students came to the conference from over 110 countries. The conference location changes between cities around the world every year. At the conference, El Bakali participated in a committee that roleplayed Spain’s governmental transition in 1975. El Bakali represented former Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez on the council of advisors of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. In his position, he advised the King of Spain during the transition following Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. Over five days of intensive debate, the committee wrote a new constitution and achieved democracy. Throughout the conference, El Bakali interacted, learned from, and formed relationships with students from around the world, including Venezuela, Tanzania, and Canada. “We achieved democracy. It was very intensive debating with others (sic) advisors from all political spectrum, but we managed to do it,” said El Bakali. Morocco and MUN As for Morocco’s role in the MUN, El Bakali was the only participant in the conference of over 2,000 delegates. “I would like to see in the future more Moroccans participating in these kinds of events because Morocco needs people who are prepared and MUN prepares us very well,” said El Bakali. El Bakali believes that MUN is a special experience where students can get exposure to competitive students with advanced debating skills. While Morocco hosted two MUN conferences in the cities of Agadir and Ouarzazate in 2019, MUN clubs and conference have yet to gain popularity with Moroccan youth.  “Morocco needs to invest more in political studies because at this moment I don’t see in Morocco the interest in politics as I see here in Europe. I would like to organise in the future a Model United Nations Conference in Morocco,” said El Bakali. “Moroccans are good at having relations with people from other countries and that’s very important in diplomacy,” he continued.  Petitioning the King of Spain Beyond taking part in the conference,  El Bakali also had the opportunity to meet several prominent political figures, such as Spanish Minister of Science Pedro Duque, President of the Community of Madrid Angel Garrido, and King Felipe VI of Spain. During El Bakali’s meeting with the King, he delivered a petition concerning the name of his hometown of Al Hoceima. The petition, written by El Bakali, asks the King to grant Al Hoceima the title of “villa.” The town’s name in the 1920s, “Villa Sanjurjo,” became “Villa Alhucemas” in the 1930s. The city’s name comes from the Spanish word Alhucemas, meaning “lavenders.” After Moroccan independence, the name was Arabized to Al Hoceima and followed French spelling. The Spanish King is the only person capable of granting the honorary title of “villa” to any city due to the historical and cultural significance of the title. According to Filipino historian Luciano P.R. Santiago, the title is a “territorial classification” which “comes with a coat of arms.”  El Bakali believes the name change could attract more Spanish and foreign tourists, since the symbolic title of “villa” is held by other important cities, such as Madrid. “I think that it would transform Al Hoceima into a precious city of great cultural interest,” said El Bakali. The name change “may contribute to the prosperity of the city’s tourism after suffering from economic recession with a lack of job opportunities,” he continued. In 2007, the mayor of Al Hoceima stated that all new houses would be painted blue and white in efforts to restore the city’s traditional appearance. Members of the town are seeking to boost tourism in the region, drawing on the historical significance of the region and its Spanish influence. El Bakali received support from his family and friends for the petition but has yet to receive greater support from the town. This in part may be due to a lack of understanding of the title’s significance. “I tried to speak and I sent messages to newspapers from my region, but they did not answer me. It’s sad for me and I’m a little bit disappointed,” said El Bakali. After delivering his petition directly to the King of Spain, El Bakali hopes his voice will improve the state of his community of Al Hoceima as well as inspire Moroccan youth to become interested in diplomacy.

Rabat – Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli stressed the need to strengthen Moroccan-Argentine cooperation on Thursday, March 21, in Buenos Aires. Morocco and Argentina need “stronger cooperation” to match their “excellent bilateral relations,” said Jazouli, who headed the Moroccan delegation to the UN High-Level Conference on South-South Cooperation from March 20 to 22. Jazouli called for joint action on a range of issues, including investment, trade, and business relations. Morocco and Argentina have several judicial agreements in the process of finalization, but cooperation should extend to the agricultural, livestock, and nuclear and renewable energy sectors, said Jazouli at a meeting with Argentine Deputy Minister for External Relations Gustavo Rodolfo Zlauvinen.  In the context of Morocco’s South-South agenda, Jazouli noted “a real need to support development in Africa.” He also cited the major implications of the continent’s demographic growth. The population of Africa is expected to reach 2.5 billion people, including 1 billion youth, by 2050. According to Jazouli, development is crucial to prevent “a real humanitarian disaster [ensuing from] migration, terrorism and … underdevelopment.” Morocco has made South-South cooperation a priority of its foreign policy, said Mohamed Methqal, the director general of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), on March 19 in Buenos Aires. Argentina supports Morocco’s territorial claims over Western Sahara and does not recognize Polisario. Last year, the South American country expressed its interest in entering into a free trade agreement with Morocco.  In 2017, Argentina exported goods worth $509 million to Morocco and imported goods worth $133 million from Morocco, according to World Integrated Trade Solution. The UN Conference on South-South Cooperation is the world’s largest South-South cooperation meeting. The conference’s setting is significant, coming 40 years after the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.

Rabat – Saturday night to Sunday morning, young contractual teachers decided to camp outside of Rabat’s parliament in protest of the government’s recent decision to keep contractual teaching positions. The teachers, aged 20-30, donned white coats and carried banners with slogans such as “the people for the abolishment of contractual employment” and “freedom, dignity and social justice” as they marched around Rabat during the day. There were approximately 10,000 protesters on Rabat’s streets, according to Reuters.  As night fell, the protesters marched from the Ministry of Education to the Parliament, where they lit candles and set up an improvised camp in front of Rabat’s parliament. Authorities initially attempted to negotiate with the contractual teachers, but when the teachers refused to leave after two hours, police and auxiliary forces used water cannons and batons in an attempt the disperse the protest. March 23 was chosen as the day for this large protest in reference to a mass student protest in Casablanca that occurred on the same date in 1965, which ended in as many as 100 deaths according to the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires (UNFP). The protest follows the government’s unwillingness to change the laws on contractual employment. Contractual employment doesn’t allow the teachers to seek a permanent position in the education sector, and they can be fired with 30 days of the contract being signed.  Contractual teachers are also only paid MAD 5000 month, putting in them in the government’s ninth pay grade. Many are protesting to receive a raise to the 10th pay grade, adding an extra MAD 1500 to their salary. Approximately 55,000 contractual teachers have been hired since the practice was introduced by the government in 2016. The protests began on March 3 and are showing no signs of slowing down. On March 10, the government tried to find solutions to ease the tension, such as proposing the contractual teachers by hired within the regional academy they currently work, but protesters said this was not enough and they would keep protesting until the contractual hiring of teachers was abolished completely. Government Spokesperson, Mustapha El Khlafi, in response to contractual teachers rejecting the government’s proposed solutions, said that the protests have “nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.”

Rabat – Speaking after the second roundtable discussions on the Western Sahara, Deputy Prime Minister of Algeria Ramtane Lamamra said Algeria reiterated the need to hold a meeting with the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU). Lamamra, who represented Algeria during the second roundtable discussion on Western Sahara held Thursday and Friday near Geneva, said that his country “made contributions regarding regional construction.” Commenting on the second roundtable, Lamamra said that the meeting emphasized the “continuation of efforts and hopefully with more concrete measures, more significant advances in this  [UN-led] process.” Lamamra implied that his country is still firm on its position that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Morocco and the Polisario Front only. Quoted by Algerian news agency APS, Lamamra said that the agenda for this second round table “was essentially based, first and foremost, on the need for confidence-building measures between the two parties to the conflict, Morocco and the Polisario Front.” He added that the meeting was also marked by “an exchange of views on the critical importance of building confidence between the two sides.” In several prior statements, Morocco has condemned Algeria’s unwillingness to shoulder its responsibility In recent years, the Moroccan government called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict, including in the alleged unbearable situation  of Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps. In November 2018, King Mohammed VI addressed a direct invitation to Algeria, offering a dialogue initiative to break the stalemate between the two countries. Through a speech addressed on the anniversary of the Green March, the King called for a direct and frank dialogue between the two countries. The lack of unity between the Maghreb countries is “an unreasonable situation” which contradicts “the brotherly bonds uniting” the peoples of Morocco and Algeria, according to the monarch. In addition to its position on the conflict, Algeria also ignores Morocco’s invitation to open border between the two counties. Algeria’s border with Morocco has been closed since 1994 after Morocco announced a new visa requirement for Algerians following the Marrakech terrorist attack thought, at the time, to have been perpetrated by Algiers.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba has left Morocco after a medical stay in Morocco to finish his recovery after suffering a stroke in October 2018 in Saudi Arabia. Bongo left Morocco on Saturday from the Rabat-Sale airport. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani greeted Bongo in the airport before his departure. Speaking about the Moroccan-Gabonese diplomatic ties, state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press said that Morocco and Gabon have “strong relations of friendship and solidarity, based on deep and historical bonds of fraternity between the two peoples and the two heads of state.” Throughout his stay in Morocco, Ali Bongo made two visits to his country to chair official ceremonies after a coup attempt. He then came back to Morocco to finish his recovery. On January 7, a group of Gabonese rebels seized the state-owned broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. The government managed to intervene and arrested the group of rebels, killing two of them. Bongo has been in Morocco since November recovering from a stroke he suffered in Saudi Arabia in October 2018.

Rabat – Morocco has never had as many media outlets as it has today. The emergence of thousands of news platforms, mostly digital, is something to be celebrated. That is especially so in a country where the media scene was for decades dominated by the state-run television and radio company and a handful of newspapers acting as the mouthpieces of political parties. But there are serious questions about how much this boom is affecting society, whether positively or negatively. Around 2010 and 2011, digital outlets were making their baby steps. At the time, privately owned newspapers and magazines had long dethroned papers run by political parties. Private radio stations also added a flavor of diversity to the broadcast sector after decades of monopoly by the state. Advances in technology; widespread access to the internet for Moroccans; and national and international political upheavals, especially the Arab Spring, helped online platforms to increasingly extend their share of the marketplace and paved the way for the birth of more outlets. Remote and marginalized areas, long forsaken by subsequent governments and media which mostly reported on events in the big cities where they are located, got their own local media platforms. Citizen journalism flourished. Ordinary people recorded what they witnessed and posted it online or cried out loud their grievances on YouTube or Facebook, often asking their countrymen to share their videos for awareness. Moroccans, from all walks of life, have probably never consumed more news. People share, comment, react, and express their opinions freely about political, social, and economic issues in their country. Social media has given them a power never known before. Whenever there is a hot topic in Morocco, articles are written about how people are reacting to it on social media. To get more readers and viewers to engage with their content, competition intensified between digital media outlets. Instead of the sometimes deliberate blackout of some sensitive issues by state-run media, as was the case with the months-long protests in the northern Rif region in 2016 and 2017, digital platforms were at the forefront. Taking sensationalism to another level All this leads one to believe that Moroccans are now more informed than ever before and that digital platforms have had a tremendous positive impact on society. But, is that so? One of the results of competition between digital outlets is a propensity to sensationalism. Sensational news has been the bread and butter of countless papers around the world, including Morocco. Still, online platforms have given it another dimension. In the 1990s, the audience of such papers was limited due to high illiteracy among Moroccans or the fact that these newspapers were less popular than more established ones whose focus was more serious political and social issues. “Serious” papers at the time, like Al Itihad Al Ichtiraki and Al Ahdath Al Maghribiya, sold thousands of copies thanks to sensational topics. Al Itihad published graphic accounts of the sexual crimes of Mohamed Tabet, the infamous police officer who abused his power to rape women and recorded his crimes in sex tapes. Al Ahdath’s “From Heart to Heart” section was a platform through which Moroccans expressed their emotional problems and sexual fantasies. The section was so controversial that many speculated some of what was published was not real but rather figments of the imagination of the newspaper’s reporters. According to a study by the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT) published in September 2018, around 19.6 million people have smart phones that they use to access the internet. When we look at the mounting trend in Moroccan digital media to publish sensational content, we understand that many people consume it. As the economic model of digital media is based on the number of clicks these platforms get, which allows them to get advertisement, outlets understood that the shortest cut to more clicks is sensationalism. The desire to be the first to snatch a soundbite whenever a scandal erupts or a crime happens leads these outlets to cross the lines of journalism ethics. For the love of clicks In late December 2018, Moroccans were appalled when an online platform posted an interview with a child describing how she found her mother decapitated. Social media users could not understand how a little girl, already struck by the loss of her mother and seeing her body mutilated, could be interviewed in front of camera. While the editor-in-chief of the outlet acknowledged the mistake and removed the video, the damage was already done. The child’s rights were violated. The video was seen by many. Others reposted it, which means that the harm will continue. In November 2017, a high school student in Casablanca slashed his teacher’s cheek open after school. The incident was one in a series of violent incidents across the kingdom in which teachers or students were victims. While it is clear nothing justifies the student’s crime, some digital outlets published sound-bites of his schoolmates, in which they blamed the teacher for what happened because she and her colleagues decided to transfer the student to another school. The interviews with those teenagers, even though they did not bring any insight to the story, reflects these outlets’ propensity to spice things up whenever there is a similar incident of a widely-publicized act of violence. This is exactly what some of those platforms did in August 2017 when six teenagers sexually assaulted a girl on a bus and filmed their crime. The media outlets added their own touch by interviewing people from the neighborhoods of the assaulters. The interviewees defended the assailants, saying they were “only having fun.” In both incidents, the outlets chose sensational quotes from their interviews as their headlines. They did not take the trouble to make sure that such behavior, whether committing a crime or giving lame justifications for it, is not condoned. This hardly seems an issue of freedom of opinion, too, as we were clearly dealing with cases of horrific violence. The way these media outlets published their videos and the fact that these were not isolated incidents give the impression that they do not care about the victims, freedom of expression, or, as a matter of fact, journalism ethics. All they seem to care about is more clicks. Less quality, less respect The boom in digital media led to the creation of countless platforms that hired un-trained, under-paid journalists who lack, according to professionals with more experience, the tools to produce good quality reporting. There is much that can be said about the quality of language published on those platforms. The increasing use of Darija (colloquial Moroccan Arabic) instead of Modern Standard Arabic in published content will only impoverish people’s vocabulary, especially the young generation, and will deprive them of tools that help them to read, digest, write, and discuss issues in the language of education and academia. The quality of language in a good number of media outlets bears no resemblance to that used by political-leaning newspapers of the 1990s or some of today’s privately-owned papers and magazines. Much also can be said about the videos posted by these outlets, from the poor quality of sound and light to editing or angles of filming. In sum, whether we are talking about media ethics, the quality of language, or the professional and technical aspect of journalism, Moroccan digital platforms have a lot of work to do to step up to the occasion created eight years ago: That of building a more diverse, open, and highly informed society aspiring for more democracy.

Rabat – Following months of rumors and speculation, FC Barcelona issued an official statement to announce news about Lionel Messi’s participation in the Morocco-Argentina friendly game. In a statement issued on Friday, the football club said that Lionel Messi “did not have the return to international action that he would have wanted, and an injury picked up on Friday night means he will miss Argentina’s game against Morocco” on Tuesday, March 26. The statement added that the “the FC Barcelona star captained his side and played the entire 90 minutes of the friendly against Venezuela at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid, but they would lose 1-3.” Speculation ran wild that the superstar set up several conditions after Argentina announced its plan to play a friendly match against Morocco. Some international outlets reported that Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) have to pay MAD 10 million to Argentina’s football association for Messi to play in Morocco. The alleged cost angered Moroccans, some of whom started a boycott campaign on Facebook recently calling for the match to be suspended and the money to be used to improve the lives of those in need. The match convening Morocco and Argentina will serve as preparation for the Atlas Lions for the coming Africa Cup of Nations championship in Egypt, planned for June 15 to July 13. The game will take place in Tangier.

Rabat – Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has criticized contractual teachers, who are protesting to demand permanent employment. Benkirane spoke about the importance of work in Islam, which considers working hard as an act of worship in itself. The former Head of Government made his remarks in Taroudant, a city near Agadir, where he was visiting a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). “We have problems in health and education, that is true. But, we can improve education sector performance by 90 percent,” Benkirane said.  Other sectors can also be improved by 90 to 100 percent through making efforts and hard working according to Benkirane. Commenting on the protests, Benkirane said that the concerned teachers will be held responsible for their duties the same way they would be held accountable for not respecting one of the most important fundamentals in Islam, such as prayers and fasting. “I left the education sector in 1988, and I acknowledge in front of God that I was not the best professor I could have been,” he said. Morocco, according to Benkirane, is a good country. “If you compare it to other countries, our country is way better.” “We want a better Morocco, this is why his majesty the King [Mohammed VI] said that ‘something has been missing.’ This means that we are not how we are supposed to be. We need to be good and direct. If everyone is committed to their roles, everything will be alright,” said the former Head of Government. Contractual employment of teachers by contracts was introduced in 2016, when Benkirane was still a Head of Government. The announcement came after a joint agreement from both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance in October 2016. The agreement stipulates that regional education academies have the right to hire teachers on a contractual basis in order to promote human resources and to curb shortage of teachers in Morocco. The contracts, according to the government, do not allow the concerned teachers to apply for a permanent position in the education sector for the duration of the contact. Benkirane concluded his statement by advising contractual teachers to make further efforts to promote the sector and to help improve their country. “If you are telling me the minister or the ministry are responsible [for these issues], what will you gain? Whatever the program looks like, if you perform your duties and teach people sincerely, it will be beneficial,” he added. His comments generated critical remarks from internet users who questioned his role in Morocco’s politics. “Who are you Benkirane, and in what capacity are you  speaking? You no longer have a role in the political arena,” said one citizen. While Benkirane advises teacher to commit themselves and provide concrete services, the secretary-general of the Istiqlal Party Nizar Baraka said that the “government is evading responsibility for the situation of contractual teachers.” The former minister said that the contract adopted by the government is “characterized by legal fragility, as it has nothing to do with the public employment or the labor law.” Baraka called on the government to end recruitment through contracts and to improve the the situation of the concerned teachers.

Rabat – Hundreds of contractual teachers dressed in white coats while marching with banners to voice anger over the government’s decisions on Saturday night in front of the Parliament. The protest, which continued after midnight, was surrounded by several vans of police and auxiliary forces who used water cannons to disperse the protesting teachers.  The teachers continued their demonstrations despite law enforcement’s approach. The protesters held several banners and chanted  slogans such as: “social justice, freedom, and dignity” and “people want to bring [temporary] contracts to an end.” The protests followed statements made by Minister of Education and Vocational Training Said Amzazi and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, who reaffirmed the government’s unwillingness to abandon employment by contract. While the government calls the protesters “contractual teachers,” the demonstrators have described  themselves as “forcibly contractual teachers.” What’s in the contracts? Contractual employment in the education sector was introduced in 2016, when the country’s government was still run by former head of government Abdelilah Benkirane. On November 1, former Minister of Education Rachid Ben Al Moukhtar Ben Abdellah announced that regional educational and training academies are able to employ teachers via contract, in accordance with Joint Decision Number 7259, convening Ministry of Education and Ministry of Economy and Finance. One of the conditions of the contract is that regional education academies have the right to terminate a contract within 30 days of sending notice to the teacher. 
The teachers, who are required to have a  university degree, can be hired on a contractual basis  after oral and written tests and one year of field training. According to the document signed by the former minister, contracts sought  to strengthen human resources. The decision came as an attempt to solve the teacher shortage as a matter of urgency and to curb unemployment. A condition of the contract specifies that  the concerned teachers are not allowed to seek a permanent position in the education sector after signing the contract.  The contract requires  teachers to undergo a training period. The contracts can also be renewed for one year after training. The documents also state that employees will receive a monthly salary similar to what teachers in the public sector receive: starting from MAD 5,000. Contractual teachers have rights to promotion and pension, in addition to maternity leave for female teachers, public holidays, and summer holidays. The teachers, according to the document, have the right to “social protection,” which enables them to enjoy several benefits, including the ability to participate in  health coverage managed by the “general cooperation of national education.” Why are they protesting? Contractual teachers argue that they are not afforded as many benefits as those in the public sector, especially concerning retirement. The teachers are requesting  permanent work contracts. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said the government recruited teachers by contract with the aim of  “improving the regional academies as public institutions with administrative and financial autonomy and controlling their human resources.” Amzazi also added that the recruitment of teachers based on contracts is an “irreversible  strategic choice,” the teachers were informed of all the clauses contained in the contract they signed and committed themselves voluntarily. On March 9, the minister announced that his ministry might consider abolishing employment under fixed-term contract, giving contractual teachers more benefits. The contractual teachers, however, refused the minister’s offer as they are seeking concessions from the government. The protesters’ objection was followed by a statement from the government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khlafi, who said that the protests have “nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.” One teacher told Morocco World News, “We cannot make concessions on our rights. We have to fight for them.” He added, “It’s our constitutional right to stage strike as long as the government refuses to open a dialogue with us and solve this issue together.” Teachers are also threatening further protests, announcing that they would push for a “blank year” or anné blanche of striking from work in defiance of the government’s warnings. It remains to be seen whether the government will offer any further amendments to its decisions regarding the situation of teachers.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested on late Thursday five foreign nationals holding Israeli passport for collaborating with a network forging Moroccan IDS, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced shortly after the arrest. According to the statement, the suspects have links with the Moroccan birth documents-forging network, which Moroccan authorities dismantled earlier this month. While investigations are still ongoing, it is understood that the DGSN has reasons that network is spearheaded by Moroccans, including a Moroccan Jew, who have been active in selling fake Moroccan IDs to non-Moroccan Jews. Two of the suspects apprehended on Thursday are not new to the business of document- falsification, according to the DGSN statement. The two are believed to have links with similar networks in countries other than Morocco. Both are subjects of Interpol red notices for aerostation and extradition. One is thought to be linked to human and drugs trafficking networks, while the other is believed to have been implicated in homicides and related organized crimes at the international level. After searching the suspects’ homes, the police found large sums of money including in national and foreign currencies; a considerable quantity of hashish, fake Moroccan IDs, and many telephones and other electronic gadgets. The five suspects are currently under police custody as authorities continue investigations to shed further light on the document-falsifying network.
The news comes amid hectic Morocco-Israel relations. In the past months, there have been talks of Israel demanding compensation for Moroccan Jews who lost properties during World War II. There were also reports of perceived diplomatic normalization between Morocco and Israel. In the first half of the 20th century around World War II, there were as many as 260,000 Jews in Morocco. While that number has considerably dwindled over the years, the North African country is still widely believed to have not expelled its Jewish communities, nor dispossessed them of material and financial resources. Around 10,000 Moroccan Jews live in Morocco to this day, according to official estimates.

Rabat – Having kept a low profile until now, a number of Moroccan Christian associations want to use the much-publicized pope Francis visit to demand the institutionalization of their religious rights. The groups’ spokespersons say they want to “be both Moroccan and Christian.” A “tiny minority in an overwhelmingly Muslim country,” Reuters reported on March 22, Moroccan Christian converts see in the pope’s visit an opportunity to convey their demands in the country’s highest places. Jawad El Hamidy, the head of the Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms, told Reuters that while “foreign Christians” are visible and free to exercise their religious rights, Moroccan converts are barred from fully embracing their religion. “We want laws that protect religious minorities in the country on an equal footing. We will seize the pope’s visit to put more pressure on the state to protect religious freedoms,” he said. Hamidy’s association has reportedly addressed the Vatican a letter to denounce Morocco’s alleged discrimination of its Christians. The group is said to be planning to organize sit-ins on the eve of Pope Francis’ visit. The Coordination of Moroccan Christians, another group raising concerns over Morocco’s treatment of Christian converts, said they wanted to take advantage of the pope’s visit to “to launch a sincere dialogue on religious freedom for Moroccan citizens.” But Moroccan authorities have dismissed the groups’ claims, arguing that Morocco does not violate religious freedoms. “There is no persecution in Morocco and there is no discrimination on the basis of faith,” Reuters quoted government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi as saying. Earlier this week, Moroccan Archives in collaboration with the Council of Moroccans Residing Abroad (CCME) organized an exhibition to showcase Morocco’s history of religious tolerance and peaceful cohabitation between Moroccan Muslims and Christians. Under the theme “Christian Presence in Morocco: Living Together,” the exhibition aimed at “throwing a retrospective look on some unknown episodes of a shared history filled with strong values of forbearance, peace, and living together,” according to organizers. But beneath that image of Morocco as a bulwark of religious tolerance and enlightened inter-religious values, the country’s Christian groups claim that Moroccan laws are skewed in favor of Moroccan Muslims. “When I went to a church to declare my faith, I was told that I was prohibited to do so by Moroccan law,” a 40-year old Moroccan was quoted by Reuters as saying. During his two-day visit on March 30-31, Pope Francis will meet with Morocco’s King Mohammed VI as well as the country’s growing migrant and Christian communities. The pope’s program in Morocco put a particular emphasis on the celebration of a culture of diversity and religious tolerance.

Rabat – As a young American woman studying in Morocco, I received many messages of concern regarding the murder of two young Scandinavian tourists in December. Following the attack, family and friends in Morocco and the United States alike told me to be extra vigilant of my surroundings, warned me to stay far from areas deemed “dangerous,” and expressed their concern for my safety.  While I was slightly concerned for my own safety as an American teenage girl living in Rabat, I recognized that the murder of the two young women did not embody who Moroccans are or what Morocco is. I continued to live normally in Rabat with some more vigilance. Three months later, I peered out of the bus window in awe of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and peaceful scenery surrounding me. I was in Imlil, the nearest town to the site of the murder. After meeting with our Moroccan host, the group, which included nine young Americans learning Arabic for nine months in Rabat, trekked through the village of Imlil on foot and mule passing small homes, curious children, and kind old men. I stayed in a bed and breakfast run by a Moroccan family. Our host helped us prepare tea overlooking the valley, and a woman who only spoke Tachelhit, a Tamazight (Berber) dialect, taught us how to make a special type of Amazigh (Berber) bread called “tannourt” traditionally.  From the balcony, I listened to the call to prayer rising from the mosques surrounding me and absorbed the breathtaking environment in front of me. Having stayed in Marrakech the night before, Imlil was a breath of fresh air, where we faced no harassment or catcalls and were respected by community members. In my seven months in Morocco, this was one of the most peaceful moments I have experienced. When the tagine dinner came to a close, it was finally time to discuss the topic that was on all of our minds: How had such a peaceful place become the scene of an act of terror? How had this attack impacted the community? What was the safety like now? Our host, a middle-aged Moroccan man, openly discussed the topic with us. He expressed how completely shocked the whole community was upon learning of the murder. They could not believe that such a thing had taken place in the village they called home. Half of the economy of Imlil is based on tourism, and for over 40 years, the town has catered and cared for tourists. Here we were, sitting in a candle-lit room only two kilometers away from where the attack happened. While I was deeply saddened by what had happened, I also recognized that the town of Imlil was not just the name in a headline of a news article or a place to be feared. Instead, it is a culturally rich community filled with caring individuals who have built their livelihoods around caring for foreigners who wish to come see or hike the beautiful mountains. Our host shared with us that he has experienced many booking cancellations since the attack and that fear has driven away tourism. However, with hope, he told us that the Moroccan government implemented new security measures and protocol to ensure that hikers are travelling with trusted guides and that the region is safe. My experience staying in Imlil reminded me that a region where an act of terror has occurred should not be consumed by that event. The hospitable, warm, and open people of Imlil and the striking scenery and nature surrounding them are the soul of Imlil. Imlil is not a headline or a place to fear, but instead a small village in the high Atlas Mountains known for its walnut and fruit production, an access point to Mount Toubkal, and a peaceful community. Just two kilometers away from where a tragic attack occurred, as a young foreign woman I felt safe with my trusted Moroccan hosts and grateful to witness the wonderful village of Imlil in person.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita has called the international community and “other parties” in the Western Sahara dossier to prioritize “frank dialogue” and “political feasibility” over ideology at the end of a two-day roundtable March 21-22. As perceived momentum continues to build around a prospective end to the political stalemate in the decades-long conflict, Bourita suggested “it is time now more than ever” to get past inflexible ideology-driven hostilities. Speaking at a news conference at the end of yesterday’s roundtable in Geneva, Nasser Bourita stressed Morocco’s “genuine interest” in paving the way for a common ground to settle the dispute. For Morocco, Bourita explained, ideological inflexibility and past grievances should not waste the newfound UN-inspired momentum. Instead, the focus should be on pushing for realistic and feasible compromises. According to Bourita, “Morocco is committed [to the UN-led process] with a constructive spirit as it seeks a definitive end to this regional conflict.” Morocco’s position, Bourita asserted, is consistent with the UN Security Council’s Resolution 2440, adopted in October 2018. He said the resolution historically urged Algeria and Mauritania, until then only referred to as “observer states,” to fully participate in the trust-building and the discussions for settling the Western Sahara dispute. Having agreed to search for a solution, all parties should show “real political will” and “go beyond the stale language and approaches of the past,” he stressed. Sounding optimistic, Bourita also expressed satisfaction with the momentum found under the auspices of Horst Kohler, the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara. Bourita said that Morocco expects the UN process to capitalize on the December and March Geneva meetings and push for genuine diplomatic overtures in line with the UN Security Council’s recommendations. Bourita said that the UN and Morocco have closer visions on the steps needed to build trust and secure compromises than Polisario does. Expressions like “independence,” “referendum,” and “self-determination,” the gist of the Polisario Front’s demands, do not feature in the latest UN Security Council recommendations, Bourita explained. Instead, he pointed out, the document refers to a “mutually acceptable solution.” That expression appears on six occasions in the 2440 resolution, showing that the UN wants all parties to let go of their inflexible ideologies and rather focus on “what is realistic and politically feasible,” according to Bourita. In 2007, Morocco proposed what it called its “Autonomy Plan,” a document highlighting its vision for a lasting and sustainable political solution to the Sahara conflict. The plan calls for a legal framework that gives full political autonomy to Sahrawi locals under Moroccan sovereignty. With that Autonomy Plan, Bourita elaborated, Morocco showed its readiness for a “realist and pragmatic solution” based on compromises. Bourita concluded that Morocco’s plan is in “total adequacy with paragraph 2 of the UNSC 2440 resolution,” a paragraph that calls for a solution based on compromise, and Morocco is not ready to compromise any further than it already has. While Morocco applauds the momentum under the UN guidance, it wants the UN-led process to be a platform for brokering realistic deals rather than “an end in itself,” Bourita said.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent emergency aid to the survivors of the Tropical Cyclone Idai that hit Beira, a large port city in Mozambique, killing hundreds with thousands still missing. On the King’s instructions, the Royal Armed Forces will deliver 39 tons of aid, including tents, blankets, and foodstuffs, reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. The King’s move which follows an international call for aid by Mozambican authorities and reflects the strong “solidarity of the Kingdom of Morocco with the people of [Mozambique],” said the ministry. Cyclone Idai lashed Beira March 14-15 with winds of up to 170 kilometers per hour before moving inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing 557, according to the latest death tolls.  As many as 15,000 people have been reported missing in the wake of the cyclone. Beira, the largest city the cyclone hit, is home to 500,000 residents. The UN has called Cyclone Idai the most disastrous weather event ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. A week after the cyclone, cholera broke out in Mozambique. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned also of an increase in malaria. Morocco’s latest humanitarian aid to Palestine last year following a massacre against Palestinians by Israeli soldiers in May 2018 in the Gaza strip. FAR transported 1.8 tons of medical supplies and equipment for a Moroccan field hospital in Gaza, which arrived last October.

Rabat – The United Kingdom’s Foreign Office declared its rejection of US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. Israel later annexed the territory in 1981 and maintains control over it. “The UK views the Golan Heights as territory occupied by Israel. Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter,” read the statement.  It continued, “We did not recognise Israel’s annexation in 1981 and have no plans to change our position. Trump tweeted on March 21, “After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!” Violation of international law? Along with Russia, the French foreign ministry followed suit in dismissing Trump’s move as a breach of international law. “The recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, occupied territory, would be contrary to international law, in particular the obligation for states not to recognise an illegal situation,” declared the French foreign ministry.  In 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law to annex the area. Israel began establishing settlements on two-thirds of the area in the wake of the Six Day War, also known as Yom Kippur War. However, the United Nation Security Council’s Resolution 497 declared the Israeli move “null and void and without international legal effect.”  In a briefing on March 22, the deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, Farhan Haq, reiterated that the UN’s position is “reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council … Our policies have not changed on that regard.” Dennis Ross, a former director of policy planning in the US State Department, told Israeli news outlet Haaretz that Trump’s call was a “mistake” and would make a peace plan harder to achieve. “I don’t think it will contribute to [the administration’s] desire to present their peace plan. I think it will make it harder for Arab leaders to be responsive,” the outlet quoted Ross.  Following Trump’s statement, Israel’s minority Druze community is preparing marches in protest. According to Israeli news outlet 13News, Israel forces, right after Trump’s statement, began preparing for any possible “violent marches.”  Israel deployed snipers and riot forces along its borders with Syria to counter any potential demonstrations. In December 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He also moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of condolences to Iraqi President Barham Ahmed Salih following a tragedy that shook the country on Thursday—the sinking of a ferry that left almost 100 people dead, including children. In his message, the King expressed sympathy and compassion towards the grieving families of the victims and his deep “condolences to the Iraqi brothers,” praying that God grants mercy to the deceased and wishing patience for their relatives. Joy turned into tragedy on Thursday, March 21, when a ferry carrying families celebrating the Persian New Year, Nowruz, on the Tigris River near Mosul, Iraq, capsized. Many women and children drowned after struggling to swim against the river current. The ferry was carrying 200 people before it sank and killed almost 100. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi opened an investigation into the incident and promised to hold accountable anyone responsible for it.  Shocked and pained, a local civil servant told Reuters news agency that he was standing near the river when “suddenly the ferry started to tilt left and right, and passengers began screaming before it capsized.”

Rabat – As Christchurch’s Muslim community prepared yesterday to pay their final tributes to the victims of last week’s terrorist attacks, many New Zealanders, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, paid a heartfelt homage by wearing headscarves.   “New Zealand mourns with you. #WeAreOne“ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and thousands of others observe the Muslim Call to Prayer at Hagley Park near the Al Noor Mosque in #Christchurch #ChristchurchTerrorAttack pic.twitter.com/clbgkAneoU — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) March 22, 2019  Wearing a hijab at the funerals, Ardern gave a full-hearted speech about unity and solidarity in the face of collective tragedy. She said that the whole country stood with its Muslim community in mourning their dead. “We are one,” she noted. The hijab-wearing gesture quickly gained traction across the country and on social media, with thousands of non-Muslim New Zealanders wearing the Islamic symbol to express sympathy. Using the hashtag #HeadScarfforHarmony, they said they wanted to stand united with New Zealand’s Muslims and convey the message that the tragedy should sow seeds of solidarity rather than divisiveness. “I stand with our Muslim community today and against hate and violence,” one of the “headscarf for solidarity” sympathizers tweeted, accompanying the caption with a picture of herself with covered hair. Other users circulated the picture of a female police officer who wore a headscarf while attending to her duties at the funerals. A tweet from World HijabDay said, “A female officer wears hijab out of respect during funerals…” A female officer wears #hijab out of respect during funerals for two people killed in the #Christchurch mosque attacks.#HeadScarfforHarmony pic.twitter.com/lqjtVc2Ve5 — World HijabDay (@WorldHijabDay) March 21, 2019  Rafaela Stoakes told AFP that it was her way of joining in with mourning and standing with her Muslim friends. She said, “I felt a form of pride in paying tribute to my Muslim friends.” She noted, however, that she “also felt a bit vulnerable” being the only one to wear the hijab in her surroundings. “It takes some courage to wear one every day.”

Rabat – LafargeHolcim Maroc, the Moroccan subsidiary of a global cement company, has appointed Ali Fassi Fihri to chair its board. Fassi Fihri is replacing former chair Tarafa Marouane, who resigned. The company made the announcement in a press release issued after the March 19 LafargeHolcim board meeting.  Established in 2015 by the merger of cement companies Lafarge and Holcim, LafargeHolcim describes itself as the leading global building materials company serving masons, builders, architects, and engineers. The company also holds offices in 80 countries and employs 90,000 employees. LafargeHolcim Maroc posted a significant drop, 18 percent, in its International Financial Reporting Standards consolidated net income from 2017 to 2018. The company’s income was MAD 1.584 billion in 2018 compared to MAD 1.927 billion in 2017. Fassi Fihri managed the National Office for Drinking Water and Electricity (ONEE) for 15 years from October 2002 to October 2017, when King Mohammed VI dismissed him from his post. The royal decision, part of what became known as the “political earthquake,” came after the King expressed discontent with the slow pace of development projects in northern Morocco’s Al Hoceima area. The King had inaugurated the “Al Hoceima, Manarat Al Moutawassit” initiative to develop the region in October 2015, but the projects met irregular delays. An investigation by the Court of Auditors into the developmental delays in Al Hoceima revealed serious imbalances. When King Mohammed VI received the report, he made a series of dismissals. Along with Fassi Fihri, the King dismissed four ministers from Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s cabinet, a right the King retains under Article 47 of the Constitution. The King fired education minister Mohamed Hassad, health minister El Houcine Louardi, housing minister Nabil Benabdellah, and Secretary of State for Vocational Training Larbi Bencheikh.

Rabat – Italian police in Settimo Torinese, northern Italy, have searched the house of Italian national Salvatore Caruso, 86, for the body of his Moroccan wife, Samira Sbiaa, who disappeared 17 years ago. Caruso, who never reported Sbiaa as missing, is now under investigation for murder, reported Italian news agency ANSA on Thursday, March 21.  According to Italian authorities, an initial search found several weapons and revealed signs of human remains in the husband’s house. Police have used sniffer dogs and will conduct scientific tests which will require some time given the house’s dilapidation, said Giuseppe Ferrando, a prosecutor in Ivrea, a city nearby. Nobody has heard from Sbiaa—who would be 49 now—since April of 2002. Sbiaa’s family members in Morocco had repeatedly tried to reach out to Italian authorities to look into her disappearance but their reports never reached the police, said Italian news outlet La Republica. Last month, a women’s association called Asti, led by Moroccan Touria Bouksibi, reported Sbiaa’s disappearance to the Italian authorities.  Sbiaa and Caruso met in Morocco through a relative and got married soon after. After her marriage, Sbiaa rarely visited her family back in Morocco, according to Italian outlet La Repubblica.

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Council has passed a bill approving a framework agreement on economic cooperation with the Czech Republic, said the government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, on March 21 in Rabat. The trade ministers of Morocco and the Czech Republic signed the framework agreement in December at the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. The government’s decision to approve the bill follows years of bilateral efforts to advance economic cooperation between the two countries. According to the Czech Trade Promotion Agency (CzechTrade), exports from the Czech Republic to Morocco increased by 108 percent between 2010 and 2014. Growth in trade provided momentum for further economic cooperation, culminating in a series of high-level meetings. In December, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani received Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis while he was in Rabat on a two-day business visit with several ministers and 37 business leaders. Later in December, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said, “Morocco could become the Czech Republic’s largest economic partner” in Africa at the launch of the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. At the Casablanca forum, the head of CzechTrade in Morocco, Tamer El-Sibai, said the energy, agricultural, and building sectors are especially promising. Morocco will invest $30 billion in the energy sector alone, he added.  However, Babis, at his visit, said, “Unfortunately, I have to say that Czech companies … lack interest, especially in investments in the energy sector,” according to Radio Praha. The automobile sector is another area of potential for Czech export to Morocco, Babis pointed out. “Morocco is Africa’s largest car manufacturer. We import Renault and Dacia cars from Morocco.” Babis continued, “The Czech Republic exports 2,400 Skoda cars a year to Morocco. There is an ambition to reach 4000 soon.”  Beyond trade, the Czech Republic supports Morocco in preventing the transit of sub-Saharan immigrants to Europe. Earlier in March, Hungary announced Morocco would receive a €30 million aid package approved at a summit between Eastern Europe’s Visegrad Group, which includes the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February.

Rabat – Contractual teachers are continuing to strike across a number of Moroccan cities in protest of what they see as the government’s inability to work out viable solutions to the current dilemma of education. The government is now threatening to fire the teachers if they do not return to work. After weeks of protests and sit-ins, contractual teachers are denouncing the government for not meeting their demands, following statements from Minister of Education Said Amzazi and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi that the government would not abandon employment by contract. The National Coalition for the Defense of Public Education called on political parties and activists to join a march on Sunday, March 24, to the Ministry of Education in Rabat. The coalition announced in a statement that the march would denounce “the state’s fierce attack on public schools in an attempt to undermine public services and what is left of free education and give up its social responsibilities.” Is the government ready to make concessions? The government showed an indecisive attitude regarding the state of contractual teachers. On March 9, Amzazi announced that the Ministry of Education would abolish employment under fixed-term contract, giving contractual teachers similar benefits as those permanent teachers have. After teachers refused the offer, El Khalfi said in a statement that the protests are “unjustifiable and seek to achieve political objectives.” He argued the protests “have nothing to do with their interest, but they aim to disrupt public utility.” El Khalfi stressed that the government’s employment plan was strategic and that the framework Law 51-17 is irrevocable. The law implemented the government’s “2015-2030 strategic vision” to reform education. Protesting teachers are complaining about articles 45 and 48 of the law, which impose school fees at secondary schools and universities. According to protesters, the articles seek to “undermine free public education” and are a “blow to the poor families.” Despite the ministry’s first “concession” to give contractual teachers more benefits, the decision did not mean that the government would hire contractual teachers within the ministry but within regional academies instead. Teachers saw this as a “patchy solution” and refused it altogether.  They said that as employees of regional academies, they would still be subject to the framework law of the private sector. At the heart of their demands is that they want to enjoy the benefits of working in the public sector. Consensual agreement or coercion? The education ministry issued what seems its last ultimatum, warning teachers to resume classes within a one-week period and threatened to fire them if they do not return to work. Amzazi stated the government will not give up on the contract system and requested that teachers resume classes or run the risk of being made redundant. As both teachers and government refuse to give in, teachers are considering extending their protests to one week and pushing for a “blank year” (annee blanche) of striking from work in defiance of the government’s warnings. One teacher told Morocco World News, “We cannot make concessions on our rights. We have to fight for them.” He added, “It’s our constitutional right to stage strike as long as the government refuses to open a dialogue with us and solve this issue together.” What future for the education system?  Now that the government has taken a step backward and refused to make any “further concessions,” teachers are relentless in their demand for the government to relinquish contractual employment in education. Early this week, police forces met protesting teachers in Morocco’s southern city of Dakhla with batons and used “excessive force” to bush them back, according to a Moroccan media outlet, injuring many and leaving some in critical conditions. The government hired the contractual teachers to meet a shortage of teachers in public schools left by 70,000 teachers who retired.

Rabat – The Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Kohler has expressed plans to convene a third roundtable for the four parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict. In a press conference after the end of the second roundtable on Friday, Kohler commended all the delegations for their commitment and engagement in coming to the second meeting at his request. Sharing personal remarks, Kohler said that the first roundtable, held in December in Geneva, was seen as a “small, but an encouraging step in the search of a solution to the Western Sahara conflict.” The envoy said that no one should be surprised when he says that finding a solution to the conflict will not be easy. “There is still a lot of work ahead of the delegations. Nobody should expect a quick outcome,” said Kohler. Kohler acknowledged that it is important that for the delegations to be “able to listen to each other, even [when] things get controversial.” He added that it is necessary for the parties to build trust to make progress. According to Kohler, the roundtable “demonstrated that all delegations are aware that many people, in particular those whose lives are directly affected by this conflict, are placing their hope in this process.” He noted that “the costs of this conflict in terms of human suffering, lack of prospects for youth, and security risks” are high. “Western Sahara people need and deserve this conflict to end,” Kohler said, calling on the parties to engage seriously in the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. After sharing his thoughts, the personal envoy read the joint press release of the delegations. The delegations said that they were committed to respecting and engaging in the process. “They agreed to continue discussions in order to identify elements of convergence,” Kholer  said, adding that there was “a consensus that a solution to the Sahara issue will benefit the whole Maghreb.” The delegations also “commended the Personal Envoy’s intention to invite them back again to a meeting according to the same format,” reads the joint press release. Like at the first roundtable, Kohler seemed positive about the talks. The second round table, which took place on March 221-22, comes on the heels of the first meeting in December 2018.The second roundtable’s purpose, according to the UN, was for the parties involved in the conflicts to “start approaching elements needed for building an enduring solution based on compromise.” Thus far, each party sticks to its position, with Morocco reiterating that the autonomy plan is the only option on the table, and the Polisario still calling on the UN to hold a referendum on self-determination. Meanwhile, Algeria has not budged in its attempts to deny any major involvement in the conflict.  Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who is leading the Moroccan delegation, said in January that the autonomy plan aims to integrate Sahrawis into development plans and to preserve the Moroccan Sahrawi heritage.

Rabat – Morocco’s Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) announced that its annual net profits in 2018 “attributable to shareholders” rose to MAD 2.9 billion, Reuters reported. The figure is a 3.5 percent increase from 2017. In a statement on March 19, BCP published its results for 2018 and asserted that its activities in Morocco and African branches recorded “significant” improvement. BCP took on 260,000 new customers in 2018. BCP already had 6 million customers across Morocco, Europe, and the Gulf, the press agency noted. The bank made loans of MAD 15 billion in 2018 and increased its market share to more than 24 percent of the Moroccan banking sector. “Net banking income grew 4 percent to 17 billion dirhams on the back of an improvement in the commercial segment while general risk provisions rose to 4.1 billion dirhams,” Reuters reported. BCP’s African branches also increased both their loans and deposits.  BCP increased its loans to Moroccan companies by 9.4 over 2017. “This evolution is mainly driven by commercial performance as well as the good progress of intermediation activities, in Morocco and abroad,” said the BCP group in a statement. In October 2018, the Moroccan bank announced its intention to acquire banks in Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, and Tanzania with a goal to derive 30 percent of its revenues from the rest of Africa by 2020. BCP received only 18 percent of its revenue from its African branches in 2017. BCP also holds overseas offices in Spain, England, Germany, France, Gibraltar, the Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium.

Rabat – On a hot and sunny afternoon at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre, Malawi, Morocco’s Atlas Lions and Malawi’s Flames neutralized each other, ending 0-0, after what looked more like 90 minutes of pointless and dispirited sprinting after the ball. The game was Morocco’s last qualifier for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). For Morocco’s coach Herve Renard and his bunch of youthful lads, today’s game was more an experimentation than a show of character, having already won the most defining games. Facing Malawi, a team Morocco had emphatically defeated in September 2018, it was sensible to expect a slew of changes in the squad. Renard decided to rest the majority of the team’s starters, giving them time to freshen up before a much sterner challenge against Argentina next week. And yet, as ever, a Renard-coached Morocco, however bereft of the creativity of players like Belhanda and Hakim Ziyech, still succeeded in showing control and confidence. Renard’s philosophy, as he hammered in interviews and press conferences before and after today’s match, is that every game matters when you dream of the highest accolades. Playing Malawi, a squad already disqualified from CAN, mattered insofar as it was a time to know where the team stands in the months before the continental scramble for CAN 2019, Renard offered before the game. He maintained the same line of reasoning after the draw. The way Morocco dominated the game and the composure of this afternoon’s mostly young and second-choice squad, he said, was evidence that he can count on his bench when needed. Renard exaggerated quite a bit. But based on the performance of the Atlas Lions in Malawi, it was easy to get what he meant. Morocco’s Lions were utterly dominant, and for much of the game it seemed Malawi were the already qualified squad and Morocco were the ones playing for some last-minute exploit to salvage their honor. Malawi should have seen it coming. In fact they did it see it, and they did prepare accordingly, playing the first minutes of the match like a united legion playing to keep shame at bay. Perhaps being already disqualified seemed less bitter and far less humiliating than a final emphatic defeat on home soil. But that Malawi saw it does not mean that they stopped it. Try as the southeastern African side did against a youthful and promising Moroccan team, they were unable to keep Morocco from making Malawi’s middle and flanks irrelevant for the entire game. Even without its usual midfield maestros, it was Morocco that set the rules in the center. In their demeanor and sense of control, there was a striking sense they played thinking not of the present—which already seemed under their control—but rather of the future. This, Renard’s post-match comments suggested, looks like a squad that has every reason to fancy themselves the next African champions. But for all the dominance, Morocco was wasteful, misdirecting final passes and finding difficulty getting around Malawi’s compact-looking defensive wall. For 20 minutes, the game ran like an exercise in purposelessness. Morocco attacked relentlessly, as though they still needed a victory here to make a statement. But the attacks lacked quality and depth, with the only adrenaline-eliciting moments coming towards the end of the first half, when Charles Swini, Malawi’s goalkeeper, deftly intervened to prevent a dangerous-looking cross from causing any more danger. The second half, though a bit more exciting, was an extension of the purposeless sprints and crosses that characterized the first half. It would be untrue to call the game sleepy, but calling it exciting would also be quite insulting. Malawi, playing at home for pride but fearing that a more adventurous play would have left them more wounded in their pride than they had been prior to the game, mostly parked the bus and played with the intermittent bursts of a side feigning inspiration. It was clear, as early as the 75th minute, who the victors would be: No one. Missing its creative geniuses, Morocco’s growing technical machine needed some more oil to score one goal out of the many opportunities it got this afternoon. Lacking fluidity in the most crucial instances, Morocco’s Lions raised their paws more than they roared, causing no panic in Malawi’s defense. But Malawi also deserves some credit. Sensing that the Morocco that thumped them 3-0 in their first match last year was different than the strong but amputee squad they were now up against, the Flames realized that they could cause some damage if they took it upon themselves to try some adventure, go forward, and actually play football. The game then picked up in excitement and last-minute dramas, but the clock already showed 80 minutes, and there was a sense that this would be it for the afternoon. In those promising last 10 minutes, Rachid Alioui’s sensational free kick failed. It was the third time that Morocco, through the same Alioui, hit Malawi’s woodwork. “We tried and gave our best,” Morocco’s French coach said afterwards. That was it: They tried to win but could not, with their best chances hitting up against a Malawian side that was visibly hell-bent on conceding no goal, even if that meant scoring none either.

Rabat – Police in Birmingham, England, are investigating apparent hate attacks on five mosques, including one whose windows were smashed with a sledgehammer late on Thursday night. Officers had received alerts about the violence minutes between each attack. Police officers and counterterrorism officials in charge of the investigation said a man used a sledgehammer to vandalize one of the mosques. “The motive behind the attacks, which are being treated as linked, is yet to be established, but West Midlands Police and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit are investigating,” police stated. The Muslim community in the region fears for its safety in the worship places. Yousef Zaman, the chairman of Masjid Faizul Islam mosque, one of the targeted mosques, told reporters: “There’s a fear factor now in that adults are saying they’re going to keep their children away from the mosque today because they’re worried that it’s not safe.” Expressing shock and disgust at the attacks, he resolved to continue attending the mosque: “We’re not going to stop worship, we’re going to carry on as normal, we won’t let them win, we will defy them.” Birmingham is home to a large Muslim community. In the UK 2011 Census, 21.8 percent of the Birmingham population declared they were Muslim. Last Friday, March 15, 50 Muslims were killed in terror attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attacks shook the world but also united New Zealanders, who showed support and compassion toward the families of the victims. Today, March 22, one week since the terror attack, thousands of New Zealanders rallied near Al Noor Mosque in mourning. Women, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, wore the hijab to show support for the Muslim community. The country also broadcast the Friday call to prayer on national television and observed two minutes of silence. Mosques have been the target of many hate and Islamophobic attacks across the world. Earlier in March, the German Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (Pegida) group attacked a mosque in the Netherlands by hanging a banner with an obscene message insulting the prophet next to a mannequin dressed in traditional Arab male dress with a bearded face covered in dark paint. The Islamophobic attacks on Muslims and sacred places continue to spark condemnations.

Rabat – The head coach of the Nigerian football team, Gernot Rohr, has said that Egypt and Morocco are his favorites to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Quoted by several international news outlets, Rohr said, “According to the last FIFA ranking, Morocco are currently the best in Africa, while Egypt will play at home and enjoy the support of their fans, and for this reason both teams are the closest to the title.” Rohr said that his team will do its utmost in the big tournament. “I am very positive. We will go to the tournament to perform well and compete for the title.” Rohr has a more optimistic view of Morocco’s football team than their head coach, Herve Renard. In January, Renard said that the Egypt and Senegal teams are his favorites to win the AFCON title. He said that the Atlas Lions will go with “ambitions, which is normal. But today, there are two great favorites: Egypt of course, and Senegal. Morocco, with Algeria, Tunisia, Cote d’Ivoire and others, is among the outsiders.” The tournament will begin on June 21 in Egypt. On Friday, March 22, Morocco’s national team will play its last qualifier game of the competition against Malawi in Blantyre, Malawi. The qualification stage for the tournament ends Tuesday, March 26, but Morocco has already qualified.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun, and the EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, Pierre Moscovici, discussed Morocco’s efforts to promote good tax governance on Thursday, March 21, in Brussels. Benchaaboun said in a statement that, in addition to taxation, they discussed other topics of common interest.  Benchaaboun added that the EU Council has taken note of “a positive evolution in Morocco’s commitment to respect the rules of good governance as they are generally practiced for all developed countries.” He asserted that Morocco will adopt a framework law this year on the “principles of taxation and good tax governance.” Moscovici welcomed Morocco’s fiscal efforts. “Morocco has done the right thing by modifying tax regimes that could be harmful [to] good tax governance,” he said. In 2018, the EU added Morocco to its tax haven “grey list” of countries given time to reform their fiscal policies. In March 2019, the union did not move Morocco to its “black list” of tax havens, but gave it until the end of 2019 to enact reforms, citing the progress Morocco achieved in 2018. As with other countries on the grey list, Morocco has one to two years to reform tax policies. After his meeting with Benchaaboun, Moscovici wrote a tweet praising “the fruitful cooperation with Morocco on good tax governance. Confident that the commitments made will be maintained!” The meeting also highlighted the prospects for economic cooperation between the EU and Morocco. “We have planned missions in the coming weeks to establish the principles of a much closer collaboration than in the past,” said Benchaaboun. Moscovici said he will soon be going to Rabat “to strengthen our economic cooperation.” He welcomed the “positive results,” citing in particular the EU-Morocco fisheries and agricultural agreements that will come into force “very soon.” In January, the EU Parliament passed the Moscovici-proposed amendment to the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement that includes Western Sahara. Pro-Polisario groups opposed the deal, saying that Morocco “exploits the natural resources” of Western Sahara. However, a group of Sahrawis urged the EU to adopt the agreement, citing benefits for the development of the region. In 2018, according to the EU Commission, Morocco’s trade with the EU was €39 billion. Morocco maintained a 1.2 percent share of EU international trade. The EU imports from Morocco were worth €16 billion and exports €23 billion.

Rabat – The national market has prepared foods in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of citizens during Ramadan, said Lahcen Daoudi on Thursday, March 21. During a meeting of the interministerial commission in charge of food and price monitoring, Daoudi, the minister delegate for general affairs and governance stressed that everything needed in Ramadan is “available in the domestic market, in higher levels than last year.” Daoudi noted the drop in food prices in contrast with last year, “particularly those of chickpeas.” He assured consumers that the prices would not change during Ramadan, which will begin May 5 or 6. During Ramadan, chickpeas are especially important as a base for Moroccan soups. Other popular food items during the holy month in Morocco include meat, fruits, fish, dairy products, and breads. Daoudi chaired a government meeting Thursday that also reviewed wheat production and the need to have a sufficient supply for consumer demand during Ramadan. Last year, a major boycott campaign in April against the high prices of commodities continued through Ramadan, which began  May 16. At the time, the Moroccan government evaluated the supplies of fruits and vegetables, while also strictly monitoring their prices to prevent price manipulation in accordance with Law 31-08 on consumer protection. According to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP), which keeps track of economic, demographic, and social statistics, food prices in the country dropped by 0.4 percent from December 2018 to January 2019.  Fruit prices fell by 3 percent, vegetables by 2.8 percent, meat by 1 percent, and dairy products by 0.2 percent.

Rabat – The people of New Zealand came together on Friday to mourn the 50 lives lost in the terror attacks on two Christchurch mosques, one week ago. It is a national day of mourning in which the country broadcast the Muslim call to prayer on television and observed two minutes of silence in memory of the victims. Before Friday prayers, an estimated 20,000 people attended a memorial service in Hagley Park near Al Noor mosque where most of the worshippers who died lost their lives in the first attack on Friday, March 15.  At 1:30 p.m. local time, the national television and radio broadcast the call to prayer, followed by two minutes of silence. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed the thousands of people gathered at Hagley Park.  She expressed: “This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart … Instead, we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable … we are brokenhearted, but we are not broken. We are alive, we are together, we are determined to not let anyone divide us.” Ardern spoke directly to the families of the victims, saying, “Your loved ones did not die in vain. Their blood has watered the seeds of hope.”  “New Zealand mourns with you. We are one.” Imam Gamal Fouda, who survived the terror attack at Al Noor Mosque, told mourners in Christchurch during his sermon that he “saw hatred and rage in the eyes of the terrorist.” In the eyes of thousands of New Zealanders and “human beings from around the globe,” however, he saw “ love and compassion.”  The imam called on governments across the globe to fight hate speech and anti-Islamic rhetoric. “It was the result of the anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim rhetoric by some political leaders, some media agencies, and others,” he stated. At the front row of the gathering, wounded survivors sat in wheelchairs in front of non-Muslim New Zealanders standing in the rear rows. Women, including Ardern, wore the hijab to show their respect and support for the Muslim community.

Rabat – The UK has updated its foreign travel advisory for Morocco, advising its citizens to be “vigilant at all times.” The UK said that “terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco,” recalling the Imlil murders when terrorists decapitated two Scandinavian tourists  near Mount Toubkal. Britain also warned that “attacks could be indiscriminate or target foreigners.” The warning mentioned the April 2011 terror attack when “17 people were killed and 25 injured in a  large explosion caused by a bomb in Marrakech at the Argana restaurant in Djema el-Fna Square.” “There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time,” said the warning. Last month, in a controversial move, the UK revoked the citizenship of a teenaged girl, Shamima Begum, who had joined ISIS in Syria in 2015 but wanted to return to the UK after giving birth. Begum’s three-week-old son died earlier this month in Syria, the third of her children to die in infancy, according to the Guardian. Canada also updated its travel advisory for Morocco on December 20, days after authorities found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway on December 17. Morocco has experienced comparatively fex terror attacks. The Argana cafe bomb was the last terror attack in Morocco before the Imlil murders.  Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy, which was modernized and updated in 2015 with the creation of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), an elite anti-terrorism police bureau, has helped curb terrorist threats in the country.  Following the Imlil murders, senior Moroccan officials said that every country faces the threat of terrorism. Morocco’s security services arrested at least 22 suspects in connection to the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists.
